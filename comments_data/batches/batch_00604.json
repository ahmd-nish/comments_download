However, I do get why it isn't a vanilla thing, eventually, you get less reason to go to the enchantment table. However, I sorta dislike every enchantment being random each time. I get learning a new spell should be random, but it makes enchanting tedious luck compared to the RPG vibe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In my mind, the enchanting table should be used to search/luck for new spells to add to a codex. Which could be the changing of bookshelves to hold and increase in enchantiblility based on the quantity/level of the enchanting books stored in them. A new block could then draw from the bookshelves to enchant from books stored on the shelves \"in the codex\" but at a higher XP and lapis cost as the book wouldn't be consumed. It would make magic more grindy as you could just craft 16 shelves and jump to the best enchants the original poster pointed out. however, with the new block, you could customize smarter and are then using the Enchanting Table to expand your spell options</p>",
