Like maybe add chili peppers to the nether or add colder food to the end as I feel the end is a cold place. Maybe even Mojang could add a food geode in end Islands that's like green. Mojang can be super creative with the game and steer it in a different direction than it is now. 1.21 is a great update so far and I hope there will be more updates that affect early-middle-endgame and extra. I feel that going out hunting should usually be a better option since it's a harder and more dangerous choice but maybe if you have a whole farm with late game fruits and vegetables then that could still be viable. I just hope they at least think about this type of update since pretty much everyone would like it. But in short, Yeah I agree</p>",
