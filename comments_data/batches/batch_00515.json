The only way to smelt it would be in a blast furnace and it would need a bucket of lava to smelt it and it would take maybe a whole day in minecraft to smelt one piece of it. I think of you made it extremely rare and made it like I had it then it would be not as op and would make it more balanced maybe make it as an ore that is mixed with iron and gold to make one ingot of it maybe you need 3 iron ingots 3 gold ingots and three adamantine shards or pieces and then you got one adamantine ingot that you could use to upgrade any weapon or tool or armor and the armor would only be allowed three enchantments and it would never break but also it would never burn get blown up or even get damage at all you would take damage but the armor would absorb it and protect you a bunch but it would never take damage only you would if the person hit you enough.</p>",
