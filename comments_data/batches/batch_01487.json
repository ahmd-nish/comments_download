They would rarely walk, mostly stick their head in the water to eat, and when they do walk, they walk slowly. If you attack one, it will fly away until it can't see you, and then look for more water to feed in. At night, they tuck their head into their back feathers and fall asleep. If killed, they only drop feathers. They would be useful because when a baby flamingo grows up and loses its white down, it drops 10 feathers, a very large amount.</p>",
