They are superior to bows until the player gets access to enchanting and therefore power 4/5, infinity, and flame, which happens pretty early in most players' worlds. Firework ammunition evens the gap out a bit but they are too expensive to use consistently compared to the infinite arrows of the bow. After that threshold they become relatively useless for PVE combat. I would rather them have a unique damaging enchantment than just copying the default bow enchantments but something needs to done regardless. My idea was for an enchantment that makes damage scale up the further the projectile travels, potentially being higher than power 5 if shot from far enough. This leans more into the sniper aspect and makes it more rewarding than bows depending on the skill of the player. Also, if they ever decide to add the spyglass as an attachment, this idea would fit the theme even more.</p>",
