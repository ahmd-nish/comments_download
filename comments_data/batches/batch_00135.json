        "body": "<p>Nice idea! I was about to post and idea about this but I found this which is really good! There could be different ice blocks rather than the blocks from the overworld. I would also love to see some mist at the bottom of the biome which could add to the coldness of the biome. Blazes could also take damage when entering the biome (since they are made of fire) which could add a sense of realisim. However, there could also be ice blazes in this biome which could use the icecronium snowballs as weapons. It would be impossible to start a fire there as it would immediately die and lava would turn to obsidian. It could also be the only place where you can actually place water in the nether, but it will turn to ice. I like the fact of a new ore that could make snow balls turn into weapons. And finally I love the idea of a piglin who would attack you even if you are wearing gold armor.</p>\n<p>P.S: another note, the developers said that any mob for your biome ideas should be put in there own place, if you talk about your pigwurst mob in another post and link it here, there is a better chance this will get more votes or even get added :).</p>",

All the server would have to do would be to generate a 16x16x16 cube of air, and only save the chunk if the player modifies it.</p>\n<p>It might even be worth it for performance to expand the chunks from 16x16 to 32x32, because moving from a chunk of 16x16x256 that contains 65536 blocks, to a chunk size of 32x32x32, it would contain half that (32768 blocks). This would mean that the new chunk dimensions would cover a similar-ish area so hopefully wouldn't be much more work for lower end systems.</p>\n<p>Mojang has shared their ideas regarding extending the world height limit. I think making chunks to be 32x32x32 would be alot of work, but so would extending the height limit to 512. Doing something like this would make it possible to have everything at the same level, such as the surface be at y=~70. The deeper caves and the deep dark could be well below y=0. An advantage to doing something like this is: say Mojang wants to add more stuff to the game, the average consumer hardware has improved alot, so they might otherwise extend the world height limit to 1024, or even 2048. If they add cubic chunks to the game, all they have to do is expand the world generation code if they want to go deeper/higher. </p>",
