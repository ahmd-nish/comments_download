Players could walk up to one another individually and be given the option to trade with what they have inside their inventory, instead of throwing their items on the ground. This would prevent players from defrauding each other by ensuring they receive what they bargained for. Both players would have to propose an offer and agree with a trade to complete a transaction. Sure, it would be possible to accomplish this by having a trading block, but that might bring the opportunity for all players in a multiplayer world to trade instantaneously. This might discourage people away from playing normally (via getting the materials yourself) more often. If not, then I don’t see the point in requiring players to craft a specific block just to trade. That adds an extra step for trading that should already be available from the get-go reliably.</p>",

I'd also love the ability to upload custom paintings to the game, including PNG and GIF files. it's currently possible to make custom \"paintings\" by overwriting maps using special programs but that's impossible on servers and realms, I also don't want to just change the texture pack I'm using, it'd suck if I put a custom painting up in my house that really fits the theme of my build but everyone else on the server only sees like a Creeper or something and it actually clashes with the decor.</p>\n<p>I want custom paintings on realms and servers that people can actually see. also add HD player skins so I can make myself more fancy.</p>",

This would enable players to automatically keep the same layout between different worlds. And if the data is saved to its own file, it would allow custom creative layouts to also (manually) be moved or copied to other game folders (and thus profiles), similar to data and resource packs. But the file should not be saved directly in a world folder, as it could be invasive to the user to have to copy their favourite (possibly effort intensive) creative layout between every world they want to play in.</p>\n<p>By default when there are no customizations made yet, the file automatically gets generated with the current game-default layout when needed. Not sure exactly \"when\", due to limited technical insight, but if not performance incurring, preferrably when the first customization is made.</p>",

Having to leave a device logged into a world 24/7 just so others can join is not practical, because it pauses the world and does not allow others to join if the host has the game paused or running in the background. Playing your own world offers 8 player slots, and a realm only offers 10, so paying for a realm is not plausible at the extra cost. Especially when a dedicated server on a really good internet connection could easily handle 20+ players at one time.<br><br>PC users have a button in the Servers tab to \"Add Server\", and it should be present on all devices/consoles. This suggestion is three years old at this point and is becoming more and more relevant for many players in this era, but not enough people know to come here to make suggestions like this.<br><br>Developers can use the same concept for this as is available to PC users at no additional impact other than making it noted to users on certain devices if their device is not compatible with the add-ons included on that dedicated server.</p>",
