Since a crossbow bolt does 9 damage in bedrock, I would say it would work, if the bolt hit the ghast first, but, in java, the max damage of a crossbow is 11, so that will one-shot a ghast, resulting in the fireball flying through the ghast's dead body. Also, if the fireball hits the ghast first, it does 1000 damage, which is enough to kill the ghast 100 times. Then, the crossbow bolt will just fly through the ghast's dead body.</p>",

It somehow makes portals obsolete, is confusing to inexperienced players and op in pvp. Also, this can lead to a lot of lag.</li>\n<li>Make the player attract mobs.
