I was chased by about 30 hoglins at once (as I was running from about 5 more and more agrro-ed on me), and I only managed to get out by doing a sort of divide and conquer strategy: which took about 45 minutes. Also, when holding a shield, hoglins can still fling you in the air which does a lot of damage without feather falling. Personally, I think they should only attack in groups of 2 or less. In larger groups, they would feel more safe and wouldn't attack. I think seeing as they have the health of endermen, take little to no knock-back, and can run very quick: I believe that they should be neutral in larger groups. Separating them from endermen but not making them overpowered. I think hoglins should also lose a lot slower than the player. If the idea is that they are big and bulky, and as a result take little knock-back and have a lot of health: I think they should also be a lot slower to keep in line with this</p>",

Another time, I was knocked back into lava and lost everything I had. And even if you aren't knocked into lava it's <em>impossible</em> to go back and retrieve your inventory afterwards because by the time you get back there's 500 more hoglins than there were before. The nether is supposed to be challenging, but it's not supposed to be impossible. As it is I haven't been able to play in the nether for more than 5 minutes at a time before I'm slaughtered by a hoglin and have to turn off the game because I'm so overwhelmed. All I want is some gotdang netherwart to cure a zombie villager and I can't get deep enough in the nether to find a single fortress because of all the hoglins in the way in every direction. I'm not exactly a scrub when it comes to combat, but the hoglins make the nether unplayable.</p>",

And that’s not even including the other pigmen who spawn out of nowhere in 3’d rapid hitting you and killing you almost instantly. Tell me mojang how is this fair? So let’s see on one hand we have the fat pigs who run fast, do high dmg, can hit you first, and take forever to kill! And on the other we have idiotic pigmen who will spawn behind you, get to you in 1.5 seconds and start beating you with there buddies who also spawn next to him. \n<br />Mojang: “Let’s make an enemy who spawns in bunches, is really fast, hits you before you can hit them, and have a lot of health.
