They spawn just as much as other basic hostiles. The current sword enchants simply don't scale with creepers. Sharpness adds half as much dmg than BoA and Smite vs intended targets. If anything, it would make more sense to have no specialised enchants against the other mobs, except one for creepers.\n<br />Because BoA is pretty unused right now, it would be best to replace it with an enchant that álso works vs creepers.</p>\n\n<p>This is a matter of balance, not enchant names or lore logic.</p>",
