The player needs to bring a ghast to the overworld, follow it so it doesn't despawn (or name it), wait for a thunderstorm, hope that lightening hits the ghast but doesn't kill it, heal the friendly ghast (maybe it can eat gunpowder) and then attract the friendly ghast and equip it with a basket. Even more, the player needs to put a leash on it and tie it to a fence because otherwise it would just fly away in a random direction (like a horse can get lost).</p>\n\n<p>I don't think it's overpowered but I think it would be fun and quite useful.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Awesome!!! Servals are my brother's favorite animal! I would like to suggest a few small changes: Servals in real life do not come in contact with sea turtles, so I would remove them attacking baby turtles. Also, they only eat small mouse-sized mammals and birds, so I would only have them attack chickens, parrots, and the hostile mobs you listed. Adding the savanna was a great idea! We could maybe add a new cat variant (which acts exactly like a cat but looks different) for the ocicat, made with a cat and an ocelot. Servals should be able to detect mobs through sound (made like sculk detection) as well as sight. Also, I believe killer bunnies were removed... I love this idea so much! Thank you for adding it!</p>",
