As a result, they had to spread out the distributions of the various ores, probably in an attempt to keep from overloading the world. See <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.17</a> and especially <a href=\"https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:21w10a_approximate_ore_distribution.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/File:21w10a_approximate_ore_distribution.jpg</a>.</p>\n<p>But, they made a huge mistake with iron. Iron now doesn't spawn sufficiently until you get down to level 16, and it only rarely spawns when exposed to air. Iron is just too critical in the early game for this to be viable. Buckets, hoppers, and some iron tools are simply required early on.</p>\n<p>They need to fatten up the range of iron levels towards the top, and totally eliminate the \"not next to air\" restriction.</p>\n<p>There is one potential saving grace coming: mountains. The distribution picture (see link above) clearly shows plentiful iron up at altitudes above 128, peaking at level 256. Unfortunately, that only will be a factor in Mountain biomes, and those haven't been included in the current snapshot (yet).</p>\n<p>So, my bottom line is that it's an understandable change, but I think they leapt way too far with it. They need to find a way to get this critical resource into the hands of players earlier than it is. It probably won't keep me from playing it, but it certainly has put a damper on my evangelism for the game. And THAT costs them $$$.</p>",
