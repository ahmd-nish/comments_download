It makes no sense for it to be a villager workstation when it requires a material never found in villages.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here's how I think it should work:</p>\n<p>Tools, armor and weapons should be organized in tiers like so:</p>\n<p>tier 0: wooden tools &amp; weapons</p>\n<p>tier 1: stone tools &amp; weapons, leather &amp; chainmail armors</p>\n<p>tier 2: iron</p>\n<p>tier 3: gold &amp; diamond</p>\n<p>tier 4: netherite</p>\n<p>In that scheme, gold equipment should be infinitely enchantable. Still with ever increasing level cost of course, but you should never see 'too expensive!' when trying to enchant gold stuff, as enchantability is the one thing it has going for it (well, and now also piglin pacification).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course, upgrading should not be massively cheaper than crafting from scratch, but I'm sure you can come up with a smithing table interface that, when you put in a piece of equipment, tells you your upgrading options, and how much of what resource each of them costs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So you could take, for example, a chainmail helmet, upgrade it with 5 iron ingots, then you have to choose whether to upgrade with 5 diamonds and have a not very enchanted, but super durable piece of armor, or upgrade with 5 gold ingots and have a super enchantable piece of armor that you can put all the relevant helmet enchantments on (without having to worry about the infuriatingly confusing enchanting cost mechanics preventing you from adding that one more enchantment that you've been holding out for, forcing you to start a new helmet from scratch), then finally upgrade to netherite.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This would:</p>\n<p>- give players a reason to collect and keep chainmail and leather armor, and to actually care about their enchantments long-term</p>\n<p>- give players a reason to craft or collect and keep gold weapons and tools,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- make enchanting much less frustrating</p>\n<p>- enable players to use their starter wooden pickaxe in the end game, upgraded to a netherite one</p>",

I would say a good compromise is having it be a gamerule a player could turn on or a server owner could toggle. Giving it an NBT tag would allow us to cheat in a specific spawner, for creative and adventure map making. MC has been heading in an increasingly modular direction for years, letting players customize their game as they see fit. I dont see the issue of moving a spawner up to the surface, 30 or 40 blocks from its original y location. Some even spawn on the surface or above sea level. It would honestly encourage exploring as players would want to collect each type of spawner, and maybe use them to make their own dungeons.</p>\n<p>I would even settle for collecting them as a nonfunctioning trophy item. Its a beautiful block, I would at least like to build with it, instead of being forced to incorporate a live spawner in my build \"in situ\". Let us flex mojang!</p>",

        "body": "<p>I had the same idea as this guy, and my post was deleted in order to keep everything neat, so I'm putting my post here instead. I've&nbsp;also made some edits to my original design:</p>\n<p>Description: The&nbsp;Blowgun is a ranged&nbsp;<strong>weapon</strong>.&nbsp;It resembles a hollowed out bamboo and fires poison darts.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type: Combat</li>\n<li>Durability:&nbsp;137</li>\n<li>Renewable: Yes</li>\n<li>Stackable: No</li>\n<li>Sounds: Puff (Heard only by the user.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Obtaining:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crafting - The blowgun is crafted by placing two bamboos <strong>horizontally&nbsp;</strong>next to each other anywhere in the crafting overlay. It can also be crafted by combining two damaged blowguns together to combine their durability. There is no bonus durability from either of these.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ranged - The Blowgun&nbsp;must be loaded by using it, then used again to fire. You must have at least one Dart in your inventory to use it, or be in creative mode. When the Blowgun is being loaded, the player is forced to move at a sneaking pace. When a dart is being loaded, the avatar quickly places a dart into the end towards the player. This takes 0.2 seconds. When the blowgun is loaded, it doesn't appear any different, but the blowgun is held up the avatar's mouth, ready to fire. When a dart is fired, one bubble of breath is taken from the player, and the dart flies. It is not suggested to spam this, as it will not make a difference&nbsp;without Sting on it, and the blowdart is capable of causing&nbsp;suffocation. The dart flies considerably faster than the arrow and is unaffected&nbsp;by gravity, however, <strong>deals no actual damage</strong>. When another player or mob is hit, there is no damage indication tic or knockback. The target is hit only with 10 seconds of poison and will have never heard a sound. Darts can still be blocked by shields, and cannot harm Endermen.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Enchantments -&nbsp; Shown below. (Puff, Sting, and Knockout are all incompatible with each other. Only one can be used at a time. All others can be used together, however.)</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Puff [Levels - 1]: Firing the Blowgun no longer takes any breath. However, the light puff sound that you only heard before is now heard by everyone within 10 blocks. I know, it's a stupid downside, But it kind of made sense.</li>\n<li>Sting [Levels - 3]: For each level, one damage is&nbsp;dealt with the target. The target now hears and feels the damage indication tic, but still receives no knockback. All armor effect is <strong>halved</strong> against the damage of a Sting dart. Darts get through the cracks. Damage is not affected my strength or weakness effects.</li>\n<li>Knockout [Levels - 2]: For each level, either slowness II or slowness IV is cast onto the target for 10 seconds, as well as 5 seconds of nausea after 5 seconds of being hit.</li>\n<li>Unbreaking [Levels - 3]: Known enchant.</li>\n<li>Mending [Levels - 1]: Known enchant.</li>\n<li>Curse of Vanishing: Known enchant.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>Fuel - The&nbsp;blowdart is good for&nbsp;0.5 items worth of smelting. (It is not recommended to use this item as fuel.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Darts: The blowgun may be easy to get, but the darts aren't. In order to obtain darts, the player must brew spiders eye into feathers on a brewing stand. I'll explain my reasoning behind this below. Darts have a red core with a black feathered behind. When darts hit a mob, player, or block, only the black backside is visible. Unlike arrows, darts cannot push buttons and trapdoors when shot at them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Stackable:&nbsp;64</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>In-Game Application</strong></em>: The blowgun would be a valuable contribution because of the unique combat styles it helps kickstart. While it would not make for an excellent primary attack weapon, making up the bulk of your strategy and damage output, it would be great for being a secondary. It's just something you use to weaken your opponent before they even know your there, then charge in with your real damage to finish the job. This is why I made the darts difficult to use, to encourage intelligent use of this weapons effects.</p>\n<p>While I can see this weapon being overshadowed by the overall DPS meta, I have an appreciation for how this weapon is handled against both other players and mobs. It is also a ridiculous idea not to add this in, especially after bamboo was added in the first place.</p>\n<p>Thank you for considering my suggestion. More to come.</p>\n<p>I'll be reposting my other deleted takes on common ideas in the same way that I did here. Shame this probably won't be seen as much.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Mad3nder, Your Idea looks great and I love seeing Ideas that are well thought out ideas vs just \"we should have blow guns\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think your version of this weapon is better than mine But I will post it anyway. maybe you can steal something from it to improve your version even more.</p>\n<p>----</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The poisoned dart and blowgun is a ranged weapon that is less about the initial damage that is caused by the dart that is very little (.5 – 1 heart) and more on the lasting effect that's not to say that the darts themselves cant be an effective weapon when used with a little skill. Given that the blow gun can be fired 3 times a second if you manage to land all 3 darts on your target you will deal about as much damage as an arrow from a bow. But like I said that is not what this weapon is about. The blow gun shoots a dart that if poisoned inflicts damage over several seconds 1-5 seconds chosen at random dealing .5, - 1 damage per second. Darts, like arrows can be made to do other interesting things like slowness but for a shorter duration compared to the arrow counterparts. Effects could stack on top of one an other but not on top of themselves. for example a player could be hit by poison, slowness, and blindness and would experience all of those effects and would take all the base damage from the darts.</p>\n<p>However getting hit with 2x poison darts would not poison the double causing him or her to take 1-2 damage per second over 5 seconds.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Possible Crafting-</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Blow Gun = 2x reads (bamboo)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>0 B</p>\n<p>0 B = 1x Blow Gun</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Poisoned darts = sweet berry (B), spider's eye (S), Iron Nugget (N)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>0 0 0</p>\n<p>B S N</p>\n<p>0 0 0</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Enchanting-</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Blow Gun can take the same enchantments as the bow except for infinity.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EnderDart-</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Ender Dart is a dart with a special property and can only be obtained by villager trade. Its special ability is that it teleports the target mob to the shooter within 3 blocks this dart deals no damage. This can have many uses but primarily in battle it can be used to aid in finishing off a retreating player. But has the risk of teleporting the target behind you giving them an attack of opportunity. It can be used to remove players from the field of battle and also has adventuring applications as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Phased- When a player is hit with an Ender Dart they are given an effect called Phased tat lasts for 2 min this prevents the player from being teleported again against their will. (doesn't impact Ender Pearl teleportation )</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Potion of phased – a player may want to craft a potion of phased to drink to prevent being teleported the potion would last longer than the effect obtained from being hit with an Ender Dart</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hey everyone thanks taking the time to read my Idea post. This as well as all of my Ideas are open to comments. If you would like to expand upon the idea please leave a comment and lets discuss it. Please check out my profile to see my other ideas!

Third, I hopes that it's has a regular mirror which can be used just as a furniture that reflect the image of your skin or villanger, you can make a new kind traps with the regular mirror too, like the zombie will attracted to the mirror that reflecting the villanger and try to eat em, of coz when the zombie hit the mirror the mirror will be broken after being hit several times just like the door, it can also make a good pair if there's a periscope block or something that can be use to reflect the light to other directions, periscope block can also be use to tranfer the light from the surface to your underground house or whatever, at the same time gives the solar panel more use in deeper ground</p>",
