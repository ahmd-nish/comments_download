What could be a nice addition is that they can rarely drop stone pieces (one for each armor piece) that could be assembled in armor stands and given weapons, bows, crossbows, shields, spyglass, etc. In order to gain an actual sentinel for your base/village/house you could find some sort of stone heart or something from exploring or archeology. This will make them unique from the iron golem (protector of the villagers) and add the much needed end game mobs that adds live to some late-game builds. It encourages exploration and could give a new rare objetive for archeology. The sentinels could be instructed to follow or \"guard\" a spot just like pets, and if the feature of Roaming <a href=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360011253251-Roaming-Pet-s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360011253251-Roaming-Pet-s</a>&nbsp;gets added it could also move around your base you built.

It can be led by a lead but will only alter at hostiles if in a lite area, making it a useful mob to watch your back when solo mining.</p>\n<p>Automaters- these golems will tackle grinding tasks for players and have a maintenance or cool-down need to ensure players check up on them. Fishing, Farming, Lumber harvesting (log block breaker), Cobblestone block breaker, and Item sorting; are all tasks players would love to automate, and that could be balanced by golems that do cool-downs or need maintenance periodically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attacking/Defense- this is mostly filled already but; an improved ranged or smart turret that could be limited by actual ammo consumption (buffed by being able to toss potions) and a shield/wall golem that is 2 tall and will move in front of ranged hostiles to block their shots are two niches that need a golem.

        "body": "<p><strong>Loyalty banner</strong></p>\n<p>A loyalty banner is the item used to turn an illager into a mercenary illager. It is crafted using loyalty item (a job block or special banner pattern) that can be taken from a woodland mansion. The loyalty item is combined with a regular banner to create a loyalty banner. The process of creating a loyalty banner should be expensive (consuming perhaps 30 levels or so). A player is turns an illager into a mercenary by right clicking the illager while holding a loyalty banner in their active slot. The illager then equips the banner onto their head slot like an ominous banner. The loyalty banner can't be recovered once used.</p>\n<p><strong>Mercenary behavior</strong></p>\n<p>A mercenary illager acts according to the following rules:</p>\n<p>1. A mercenary will not attack THE PLAYER THAT GAVE IT ITS BANNER. This can be changed in a game rule to include all players or players in the same faction.</p>\n<p>2. A mercenary will attack all mobs hostile to a player</p>\n<p>3. A mercenary will not flow a player, but wander around. This behavior can be controlled by a \"sentry post\" block that it will stay with in a certain distance of. This distance can be controlled by stacking blocks underneath the post in the same manner as a beacon.</p>\n<p>4. A mercenary will be able to equip weapons and armor that it perceives to be better than its current equipment. It will determine this by a hierarchy of materials (Netherite &gt; Diamond &gt; Iron &gt; Gold &gt; Stone), and enchanted equipment is preferable to unenchanted equipment, in the case of a tie.</p>",
