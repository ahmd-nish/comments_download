Again, the commands you mentioned would \"tie in\" to these settings and possibly be able to modify them at run time,&nbsp;but might require a \"reload\" and/or server restart to apply the changes.</p>\n<p>Again, while I may or may not make use of them, I can understand wanting to disallow clients using a certain OS/platform or input method. Perhaps create a setting in the <strong>server.properties</strong> file as&nbsp;<strong>allowed-platforms/allowed-inputs</strong> where the values are either a pipe-delimited list or simply \"<em>all</em>\".</p>\n<p>One thing to note: The whitelist commands you mentioned are mostly already implemented in the console with the exception of <strong>whitelist&nbsp;</strong><em>{on|off}</em>. <strong>whitelist&nbsp;</strong><em>{add|remove}</em>&nbsp;updates the <strong>whitelist.json</strong> file in the server's directory (<em>which, as I stated above, I'd like to be able to change with a command-line argument</em>).

Especially when a dedicated server on a really good internet connection could easily handle 20+ players at one time.<br><br>PC users have a button in the Servers tab to \"Add Server\", and it should be present on all devices/consoles. This suggestion is three years old at this point and is becoming more and more relevant for many players in this era, but not enough people know to come here to make suggestions like this.<br><br>Developers can use the same concept for this as is available to PC users at no additional impact other than making it noted to users on certain devices if their device is not compatible with the add-ons included on that dedicated server.</p>",
