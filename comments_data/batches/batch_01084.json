Then you realize that the more you explore the harder it will be to explore in the next update because even though you just looked at a few random spots and did nothing of importance in them they will never again be updated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is really annoying that just because you loaded a chunk and never did anything important in it that now that chunk will never be updated. Then on top of that random chunks will and won't update making your world look like throw up because random chunks decided to not update making them super tall or low compared to the surrounding area.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Basically, this is a good idea and should be added. Also, if there is ever a cave update you should be able to select whether or not you want to update the underground area and select the axis level at which your world will update below it. So basically if my base goes 20 blocks underground I select the Y axis at which my base ends so all the blocks under that throughout my world will be updated.</p>",

This would work on the next way:\n<br />Each level the distance is increased by +3 per level starting with +5 block distance on the level 1.\n<br />When you attract an item it can travel through any type of block, liquid.(this means this item can travel trough lava without getting burned)\n<br />Increase of the speed of +0.4 block/sec per level starting with a speed of +1 block/sec on level 1.\n<br />When you're attracting an item it reduces the durability of it based on the distance -1 durability per 5 blocks of distance.\n<br />For both version you need to point the item wich you want and then on bedrock press the attract button and on java press the attrack button. (Only if you have the gloves and you're not using any weapon, tool, item, block. on your hand)</p>",

We would need to add bunched or coiled chains to the game to account for the pushing action of pistons as well as what happens vertically if the top of a chain is let go of or given slack. Ideally a pulley could also be added to allow changes in the direction of a single chain which would open up some new applications for this possible new mechanic.</p>",
