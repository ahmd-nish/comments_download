The music disc \"5\" is very creepy and a lot and seriously a lot of lore is found inside it.</p>\n<p>That said I still think the ancient city loot isn't quite enough. Again I feel kinda bad for saying that since I know Mojang is working hard to try to satistfy the community. But this is some feedback so let's get back to the point.</p>\n<p>Last snapshot you buffed the warden (22w15a) wich is a good thing don't get me wrong. But you made the balance (Good loot and chance of death to the warden) even more unbalanced. You now have a greater chance to die to the warden. And the loot is still \"meh\"</p>\n<p>wich will make more people not go to an ancient city, and if they go they will probably go only once or twice.</p>\n<p>I don't know if this is the goal Mojang wants but it feels odd. I still have my hopes for 1 more use for echo shards. And of course the mysterious portal in the middle, I think that the \"portal\" will be worth it going to an ancient city multiple times.</p>\n<p>1 more thing: I think the middle of the crafting recipe for the new music disc should be an echo shard. It makes sense and it would give hardcore players a reason to pick up the echo shards.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyways I still really like the new snapshot, seeing the update grow is cool!</p>\n<p>If there will be nothing more than this than that's fine, the loot is good enough!</p>\n<p>10/10 snapshot!</p>",

My heart races and I know that if I make a mistake I will take a ton of damage and probably die.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dislikes: A freshly spawned warden is way too easy to avoid. It is currently possible to just run away while it's doing it's emerging animation then sit still, or go explore other places while it just roams aimlessly. The warden should detect vibrations while it's emerging like how it detects collisions while it's emerging. I know it's sniffing radius was increased in 22w15a, but it's sniffing radius is still not big enough. It should also hear vibrations from a way greater distance.&nbsp;</p>",

However, it seems that after you get detected by the warden it will lock on to you and you can't escape it unless you dig into the cave or build up out of range of its sonic boom attack. Because of this issue, most of my experience with the warden was running away from it instead of hiding and sneaking. To fix it I would suggest making the warden lose track of the player after performing a couple sonic boom attacks. That way you get a chance to hide again.</p>\n<p>When testing I usually got 10-30 echo shards per city which is more than you will ever need in a single-player world.

This one brought a few suggestions to mind:</p>\n<p>For the <strong>d</strong><strong>isc fragments:</strong> I like the idea and the purpose behind having those items scattered around the city. However, why wouldn't echo shards be able to achieve essentially the same effect, without being a brand new item?</p>\n<p>If so, I'd suggest them becoming a part of the crafting recipe, perhaps them + disc 11 since it’s the only broken disc. It would’ve become the mold of an even older sound record..</p>\n<p>Another item I think could still use some work are the&nbsp;<strong>Echo</strong> <strong>shards.</strong> Them being one of the only unique items of the ancient city, it would make sense for them to be one of the strongest incentives for raiding.</p>\n<p>But, as you might know, there are still too few uses to justify such high risks. What if, since they have \"echo\" in their name, they could store sound effects? Like a creeper hissing or rain falling? Perhaps using goat horns too for the sound to be heard!</p>\n<p>Putting all that aside, great job on the sound department. The disc 5 sounded very eerie and misterious - which I feel was the goal, apart from having lots of lore imbued into it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, I really liked this snapshot. I give it a solid 9/10 for the changes, only nitpicking on the above. <br>Thank you for so many cool new things! :)</p>",

I like the suggestion of incorporating Echo Shards into the new music disc recipe.</p>\n<p>Even with the frog changes, mangrove swamps still feel a bit empty, and it's weird having bees being their signature other mob when there are already other biomes that spawn bees and not much else. In real life, Mangrove swamps are incredibly species-rich and biodiverse. Adding the tropical fish went some way to help reflect how mangrove roots are \"fish nurseries\" in real life, but it's still lacking, and a new water foliage type would be great as well.</p>\n<p>If we don't get a totally new mob, I'd like to see mangroves get an exclusive parrot - maybe a green and yellow one - that would only spawn there. Players would still need to go to jungles to get other parrot colours so it doesn't diminish jungles.</p>\n<p>Plus, I still feel white frogs look weird in the shady environment of the mangrove forest, which has a very dense tree canopy blocking sunlight. I would prefer to see white frogs be a desert/badlands/savannah exclusive.</p>\n<p>Finally, I hope the bundle, birch forest and goat horns have not been abandoned! Without them this is more a Caves &amp; Cliffs Part 3 + Swamp Update than a true Wild Update.</p>",

It is huge and sounds scary, but not too scary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dislikes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Despite it running fast, it doesn't go up blocks very quickly, so it's vertical movement is slow. It doesn't know how to sprint jump like players so it currently slows down to jump up each block. I believe because of how huge it is, it should be able to run up blocks like horses. This will make avoiding it by jumping up and down blocks a little harder.</li>\n<li>The Warden's Tendril detection range is too small. Since the structures Ancient Cities are so huge I recommend it being around 40 blocks. This will make it have the same detection range as a zombie.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If a Warden is currently angry at a player and chasing them, and that player activates more sculk shriekers that summons another Warden, that new Warden should get angry with the player right away.</li>\n<li>If a Warden can't reach a player or gets stuck. It should dig down, move around with the animation that the sculk spreading has, and then emerge closer to the player it is angry at. This can help prevent cheesing.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Didn't feel very nice while mining and stuff.</p>\n<p>I think the 30 seconds limit should be increased on a noteblock, if not just assigned permanently until the block is broken (or maybe it could be toggled with wool occlusion?).</p>\n<p>The way it throws items seems okay; looks like it can reliably get items into a set of hoppers, and it shouldn't be much of an issue when it misses, since it picks them up and tries again after a moment or two.</p>\n<p>Ancient City thoughts:</p>\n<p>It looks really cool imo, definitely improved with the sculk everywhere and stuff.

There's still no way to get renewable Allays, which is worrying as they are likely to die from newbie players, lava, creeper etc. They should be able to breed somehow, perhaps with music discs. They can also naturally spawn rarely on certain biomes. Helpful mobs spawning exclusively at night (or on certain moon phases) will encourage players to explore the night, as right now there's no unique reason for players to spend the night. If they want mob drops, they build mob grinders or fight on caves.</p>\n<p>Ancient cities have more interesting sections &amp; loot now, it's great. I hope there's more huge challenging dungeons in the future!</p>",

Many users wish to create their own warden \"areas\" for a variety of creative purposes. Without the ability for players to move and still use shriekers, its ability to be activated threw redstone is no longer a useful or interesting mechanic. What is the point of redstone activation if we are limited to building in areas where shriekers have naturally spawned? The warden not being able to hit the player if they are above 4 blocks is a good temporary fix for \"cheesing\" the warden however Is only a band aid for for the true issue and should be solved with a more clever and functional solution as you can still sit atop a 5 block tower and shoot it to death with arrows or kill it from a small horizontal shaft. Shriekers also still have too low of a player radius in order to summon a warden or areas require more of them as simply running away from a fully activated shrieker that should be ready to summon the warden are easily skipped by just running 10-15 blocks away. Ancient cities should be made harder or harder to avoid the warden as I can currently easily clear a city with torches, food and a stone or iron hoe to speed up breaking shriekers/catalysts. Otherwise new structures are good, Icebox is useful, and old ones have good improvements.</p>",

Lore-wise this explains that allays do exist around the minecraft world and are attracted to dropped items and that they aren't just things that only pillagers can find and catch. This also gives them a personality of being helpful. Mechanics-wise this brings up the functionality that was supposed to be for the vulture in the badlands biome vote but without the need for potentially killing the mob as well as future-proofing issues on servers where there won't be enough allays because this will make them somewhat renewable, although in my vision it will still be a very rare spawn as to not encourage players to spam kill themselves. Perhaps this allay spawn chance does not occur in the nether/end/deepdark biome since I think it's assumed the pillagers catch them around the over world alone and those places have higher difficulty curves and this idea I have helps give ease to recovering items which I believe is just part of the fun and challenge of those other areas.

But I also want a chance to find helmets and chestplates as well, I would be happy with having them extremely rare compared to boots/legs.</p>\n<p>The allay is improved, but still needs work... in Java edition its movements seem slow, but I appreciate the chance to interact with it while it's resting. I think I would like this behavior if it only idled when the allay could see the player, so a farm could be efficient and the player could also interact with them as needed.<br>I feel like allays need to be easier to transport long distances. I know I'll have to travel far to find an allay and have a headache bringing them back home. If I do lose them on my trip home then it's a lot of effort wasted, and It'll be difficult to find more allays. They really need a luring item like cows or be able to follow you like pets. It also feels a bit too rare to find allays in just mansions and outposts.</p>",

Outside it's all death and destruction, and in the middle is this quaint little tutorial room? Doesn't feel right. Ancient cities are shaping up to be one of the most dangerous places in the overworld, so most beginner players would just avoid it. The beginners who do go there would end up dying to the warden multiple times and would probably just flee before finding this room. That leaves only the experienced players, for whom this room is kinda redundant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I do like the idea, but they should be implemented somewhere else, say at mansions. They already have weird rooms like these so this would fit in really nicely.</p>\n<p>Ancient cities loot:</p>\n<p>I think these cities should have loot that couldn't be found anywhere else in the world, which would make them a real incentive to explore. For example, higher tier potions unobtainable in normal survival could be added. They don't have to be useful too, just rare, for example mob heads unobtainable in survival, say the warden head can be added for players to take as trophys.</p>\n<p>There should also be maps to these places, similar to woodland and ocean explorer maps. They should be rare, only found in say mansion or outpost loot chests.</p>\n<p>While on the topic of mansions, their loot tables should have every music disc (except pigstep) and maybe also jukeboxes. This would give a bit more incentive to go looking for mansions as well.</p>",

For making music it is a good change, but noteblocks are used for much more. It is a solid block, needing no support blocks, that is updated by redstone and can update QC-powered blocks. Therefore noteblocks can and have been used in all kinds of redstone wiring since 1.13. Some people have been asking to make redstone components/contraptions less noisy. This change does the opposite.</p>\n<p>🙏 My wishlist for new snapshots: <em>Minecarts/boats</em> can be uncrafted; <em>Wardens</em> can sprint up blocks (like a horse); <em>Allays</em> will be more careful around hazards, like picking up netherite stuff from lava, right now they'll burn. They'll somehow be renewable (not necessarily through breeding).&nbsp;<em>Shriekers</em> can be reactivated (for a price?).</p>\n<p>💭New ideas: Noteblocks mimic 1 of 16 instruments. It would be nice if there was allay/instrument interaction. Different reactions to different instruments. Or different allays having their own favorite instrument, so they prefer different noteblocks.</p>",

I do redstone heavy games so use the noteblocks to communicate feedback to players, as input for players (nothing else gives you a nice looking one tick update that can be sent to observers), and in the generally quite involved redstone for it’s redstone properties. The changes removes most of the functionality of the noteblocks with adding next to no benefits (songs could potentially be smaller) Wool just doesn’t fit in a lot of contraptions. Turning off noises to avoid the sounds means you can’t also have noteblocks make noises when you need them too. They are solid, players can interact giving a one tick pulse to observers, they don’t rely on blocks supporting them, they aren’t very laggy, almost anything can be placed on them. Anyways, please reconsider changing a redstone fundamental.</p>",

My only criticism, is the Warden's current behavior. I haven't noticed many people talking about it, but I find it odd how after it senses something 3 times, it suddenly gains the ability to see and locks onto it's target. It kind of makes it feel less threatening, as it becomes just like every other mob that just pursues mindlessly, like a zombie or spider. I think it would be far more interesting if instead of the Warden locking onto it's target, it should become faster. So after it roars, every subsequent vibration that is made it full speed sprints at the location. That could prevent it just growing eyes after it grows angry. The Warden could even have a smallish detection range so if the player is to close it could still lock on, that way it won't loose it's intended victim if it tries to run.&nbsp;</p>",

If putting all of this loot in one chest is difficult, multiple chests should be in this structure with different kinds of foods. Currently the ice box loot is only barely better than the food chests found in villages and shipwrecks, so this change would help to differentiate that as well.</p>\n<p>Also I feel there should be no sensors and shriekers in this, to make it a bit more of a calmer place to hide in from all the stuff going on outside.</p>",

Kinda sad for people that wanted a pet warden lol</p>\n<p>-Making the minecart with chest and others like boats not seperateable is a great way to sort inventory</p>\n<p>Cons:</p>\n<p>-Loading chunks cause freezing and crashing when trying to teleport to structures</p>\n<p>- Warden still doesnt fit in 1x1 hole (if thats intentional) that is still cheeseable. Also sometimes they try to walk through the wall (they can't) to reach a destination</p>\n<p>-Allay are hard to catch to give item to until they get an item</p>\n<p>Suggestions:</p>\n<p>- Warden are scary and pop out at any moment, but aint it too scary and illogical for it to pop out out of deepslate, wool, ice, glass, etc. feels like they should only be able to spawn/despawn on sculk blocks only since thats where they are from</p>\n<p>-Jukebox music should trigger the sculk sensors and warden since they make vibration</p>\n<p>-A way to kick out mobs out of chest in boat, imagine your wolf get in the boat and you have to break the boat with every item in it</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Something to lure allay (cookie maybe) so you can give it an item, or heal it</p>\n<p>Hopefully this feedback helps, thanks for reading!!!</p>",

Sometimes geodes can be hard to find, but thanks to allay you might be able to find one more easily.</p>\n<p>*The Allay would only take you to the coordinates where the amethyst geode is, it wouldn't take you exactly where the geode is because the allay can't go through blocks.</p>\n<p>*When the allay is in place, it may do a little dance to indicate to the player that the geode is below, similar to how Eyes of Ender indicate the position of a stronghold or when dolphins lead to a shipwreck.</p>\n<p>*I still don't know how Allay should be told how to guide you to a geode, I'd like someone to help me with that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It has nothing to do with the geode but, I would love for Allay to be immune to fire and lava. When the player builds a structure, the blocks almost always fall to the ground and that is usually quite annoying, more if the construction is in the air, the allay could help to find those blocks and thus avoid the hassle of going down to look for those blocks. But when the build is in the Nether things are more difficult, due to the fire and lava that could kill the allay.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It's okay if it generates on structures like Mineshafts; it adds variety. When players place a block on sculk vein/glow lichen, it should destroy them, just like how you can place a block on top of grass. This helps prevent player confusion.</p>\n\n<p>Frogs eating slime should produce a dim version of the froglights. This will help give hints to players, that they can feed it magma cubes for the bright versions. Add advancements to teach new players about interesting Minecraft stuff, such as froglights, taming wolves, building snow golems etc. Light blocks should blend well with builds; a transparent light source like fireflies in bottles would be great for builds. Tadpoles should naturally spawn in swamp waters for variety.</p>\n\n<p>Mangrove's red wood looks good, but in the future, we need mossy green-ish wood as there's currently no green slabs/stairs/fences. Adding non-green leaf blocks is also VERY welcome, such as wilted brown leaves &amp; pink cherry blossom leaves. Add variety to storage blocks like chests. These are all important for builds, and is missing in vanilla Minecraft.</p>\n\n<p>Please add an easy way to renew dirt, so that players can actually farm clay &amp; mud bricks for big projects. I don't like to destroy biomes to get more dirt/sand/etc. My building palette is restricted to wood/stone in survival, since other building blocks are too hard to renew (like concrete).</p>",

I really liked this mechanic but I admit it wasn't very intuitive since the wool isn't supposed to be heard by the sensors, IMO exceptions can sometimes make things unnecessarily complicated. Also, before it was very difficult (and sometimes impossible) to cover the Sculk Sensors with wool without activating them... but now it's too easy, I just put wool everywhere and that's it, without consequences.<br>A possible solution to this could be that wool should interact with sculk blocks in the same way it does with sculk veins, replacing it. So if you aim at a sculk block directly and try to put the wool on it, it will replace/break it causing a noise and alerting the sculk sensors. I really like this solution because instead of adding a new rule, it uses the one we all understand \"do not make noise near a sculk sensor\", and it also solves the problem of the previous rule that made it too difficult to cover the sculk sensors since they are almost always surrounded by sculk block, with my solution you would still have to be careful where or how you put the wool, but it would be entirely possible to put it around a sculk sensor.</p>",

In the experimental snapshots, the ancient cities are too rare. Please don't make them ridiculously rare &amp; far away like woodland mansions!

Ideally we should be able to explore without taking up disk space, maybe like roguelike dungeon dimensions that'll reset. In the end-game, players will only build and Minecraft gets boring. There's no exciting PvE or repeatable dungeon crawls with bosses &amp; loot. Pillager raids, bastions, warden &amp; ancient cities are going in the right direction, but there's often a lack of addicting rewards &amp; not repeatable without going very far away from your base.</p>\n<p>So far, the wild update is looking good, I'm loving the mangrove roots and mud bricks for building. Sculk is potentially good for redstone. If the wild update can match the minecraft live concept arts like fungi in logs, pebbles scattered in the wild, it'll be an excellent update. Those are great to have for making better builds. Take inspiration from popular mods that many players like, and games like Hytale!</p>",

That takes away some of the suspense of the player unexpectedly bumping into sculk. For example, right now a player could dig straight down in every low-lying birch forest and be 100% guaranteed to never see sculk. That doesn't seem very exciting. I feel the Deep Dark should be detached from ground surface height and instead generate mostly around Ancient Cities, which should also be allowed to generate anywhere at low Y levels.</p>\n<p>The Deep Dark should be a living, growing biome without any help from players. Perhaps instead of the Warden being (effectively) the only mob that can grow sculk on its own by killing mobs in range of catalysts, a new fixed-place mob (like how the shulker can't really move) should be introduced to live on the sculk to take out mobs that wander too close in order to allow the sculk infestation to grow. This new mob would be generated with the sculk and additional ones could appear as the sculk catalysts generate new growth, much like how new shriekers and sensors can appear. This new mob would also be blind so the player can sneak up to it to kill it.</p>\n<p>The Warden should be its own type instead of being in the undead category. If it is supposed to be a \"Force of Nature\" as described during the Minecraft Live previews, it should attack all mobs as soon as they are sensed. It also needs to be less distracted by bats and focus on more important mobs.</p>",

While quick sand similar to powder snow but make player sink. It should generate 2-4 layer in desert spires biome. One of the interesting changes is sand and red sand mixing together at the border of the biomes when desert border badlands which they mix in wary patterns. In some occasion, hills in desert can generate sandstone on ground make it rocky.</p>",

This is so that diamond and netherite don't become even more powerful than they currently are, and to give the earlier armours a bit more use. (Also, copper plating just makes more sense for metals in my opinion.)</p>\n<p>2. I feel like plating could give more interesting and unique benefits than just more protection. In real life, copper-plating is used to increase conductivity. What if copper plating in Minecraft made things easier to enchant. A copper plated iron sword would be almost twice as susceptible to high level enchantments as a plain one. Maybe, in the case of gold, which is already highly enchant-able, it could occasionally acquire enchantments beyond what should be normally possible, like unbreaking IV, fire protection V or depth strider IV. Once again, this would encourage players to use lower tiers of armour and give them the ability to upgrade it, possibly to the point of surpassing higher tiers.</p>",

Netherite may be to easy to get, but I normally play on severs with friends and this change makes it where you basically now need 7 diamonds and 2 netherite every time you want to upgrade your gear. I like more incentive to go to bastions, but they are too rare for this change to work on servers with multiple people. All this does is increase the time you have to mine to upgrade to netherite, and I personally find mining for netherite an already boring task. What I think would make this better is if the netherite template didn't get used up when you upgrade, then people would still have to go to bastions, but it won't double the cost of netherite gear.<br><br>EDIT: Apparently it only takes 7 diamonds and a netherack to make a second netherite upgrade. That most certainly better than I thought it was. I wish the made it more clear on the update page that it took netherack.</p>",

First of all, it's a great idea that you have to visit the monuments around the map and collect pieces to design your armour to your liking. But why should I, as a player, keep raiding structures where you get relics \"left by the ancients\" only to use them and lose them forever (erasing little by little what those people kept) and destroying the supposed history just because there is always more? I don't think it's right and that's why only the durability of the netherite template should be left. For the other templates, there should be a permanent pattern version like the ones that already exist for banners. From these patterns, infinite templates could be crafted with special objects that you can find in \"abundance\" in structures or with infinite methods but very little productivity (example: the ocean monument template could be made by surrounding with 8 nautilus to a pattern of this type (something more original I ask)). That's the main problem with templates.</p>",

From my point of view, not all templates should have effects, but if by chance you add a strength to that object, must have a weakness. With this I want to drop that you have enchantments that exist only for very specific things and if you really want to increase some difficulty factors, you should develop that part of enchanting weaknesses. There will always be a better option for each situation and perhaps just for this reason people would be more encouraged to explore any structure that you add. Therefore it would be a wonderful idea to have weaknesses and strengths in these artifacts (and also that they are not affected by the material (color) added, but by the magic of that template).</p>",

My other suggestion is that glow ink sacs should be used for the armor patterns as well, I think players would really express themselves with glowing features on their armor and would give glow ink sacs another use.
