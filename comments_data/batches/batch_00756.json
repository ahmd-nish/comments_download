For me personally, I thought that Horn Bows could be made with a crafting table by combining a Bow with 1 stick, 2 goat horns, and 3 string. A possible recipe could be something like this:</p>\n<p>[ empty, goat horn, string;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;stick,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;string;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; empty, goat horn, string ]</p>\n<p>This recipe would be a little more expensive than your idea, but I suppose that a bigger perk could justify the cost. Perhaps, in addition to added durability and speed, Horn Bows could allow players to walk normally while drawing the bow - i.e. players wouldn't be forced to sneak while using a Horn Bow. I also thought that this upgrade could apply to crossbows as well, but I'd understand why they wouldn't be included. If both bows and crossbows could be upgraded though, ranged combat as a whole could see some change. Also, since horn bows are associated with traditional horseback archery in real life, it'd be cool if Horn Bows deal extra damage when used while on a horse. Overall, good idea.</p>",
