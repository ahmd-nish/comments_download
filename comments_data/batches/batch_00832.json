        "body": "<p>That's exactly what I was saying. It doesn't here SOUNDS, like the baaaa of a sheep or the mooo of a cow! It senses movement! It doesn't sense players that are sneaking even though they still make sound, because it is not hearing the sounds, it is sensing significant movement. Given it doesn't hear sounds, it wouldn't be bothered by the extreme noise of a Goat Horn. It will just sense the player when he/she uses it and puts it up to his/her mouth, which is no more severe than the vibration from eating food as it doesn't hear the blow of the horn it self. The Warden is a blind,&nbsp;<strong>deaf&nbsp;</strong>creature that can feel when something is moving around it. Just try playing a Noteblock next to a Sculk Sensor; it's as if the Noteblock is not even there, because nothing is moving significantly for the Sculk to detect! We have confirmation that Sculk Sensors and Wardens will detect vibrations in the same manner besides a bigger radius for the Warden, so don't say that the Warden might be different. Also according to Kingbdogz, vibrations is not the most accurate word to describe it, rather a general way of saying that it detects movement and not specifically sounds. I know sound is vibrations in real life, but keep real life physics aside for the moment. This is a game.</p>",

        "body": "<p>When they add new ores, they don't just add them for the sake of it. The ores need to serve some unique purpose that make them stand out and make people want to seek them. Quartz, for instance, is used in Redstone components and has unique building variants not existing in other blocks (take pillars, for instance). Some might argue that Copper is not really something you'd want to seek out, but Copper is a new addition. Kingbdogz pointed out that Copper is nothing as useful as Iron because Iron had 10 years to expand and develop. The way he phrased it suggested that they have the intention to expand Copper and make it more useful and worthwhile, so be patient about Copper; it's still very early for it. As for things like Amethysts, yes they are mostly decorative and not particularly exciting, but they have unique mechanics to at least make them a fun enough feature. However, adding an ore purely for decoration doesn't appear to be what they're going for. Even Quartz has some crucial value in Redstone, and like I mentioned, Copper will expand overtime into more than a building block, I'd guess in ways that fit its relation to building and history so that it is still unique. An ore plainly for building is not a good argument, because implementing it as just a block would be more logical in that case.</p>",

But developers of minecraft I wish u took some ideas of mine because I had a dream of working for minecraft and designing and creating these new bioms portals mobs and lots more but I notice I'm only a 6th grader not even in high school so I cant help with your amazing game but I wouldnt be able to join anyway so I ask please use my ideas one day atleast only one and I know I sound very&nbsp; very eager but I've always wanted my own idea into the game and I hope you guys like the idea too! I just think the amethyst could have more of a use to it thx and this is written&nbsp; -</p>\n<p>by MeowscIes9150</p>",
