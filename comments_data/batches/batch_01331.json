That information seems far more useful than the current information about how many slots are occupied, but you could offer best-of-both by giving a signal strength of 15 if there's a valid recipe, and the number of filled slots if not.</li>\n<li>I think that trying to put an item into a crafter that can't fit should behave the same way as for other inventories - that is, it should fail, not drop the item into the world.</li>\n<li>I think it's fine - a good thing, in fact - that there's no recipe book support in the base crafter block, but perhaps there could be a more advanced crafter that does support recipes - maybe by using the recipe book item that exists in the game but is currently unobtainable without commands. Or maybe the advanced version would let you lock each slot to a specific item rather than just being enabled/disabled.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Edit to add: I saw another comment suggesting that you could lock a slot to always contain at least one item, and I think that's an excellent alternative to the ideas in my last bullet point - whether as part of the basic crafter or a more advanced version.</p>",

The crafter allows you to craft everything you want, but to use it for more complicated items, it should require contraptions to setup the recipe by hand.</li>\n<li>This feature would go against the idea of how redstone is implemented in the game.

This would remove a big part of how users have to figure out a way to make the block do what they want.</li>\n<li>The ability to toggle slots is already a luxury, which was the way Mojang wanted less-technical players to be able to use the block more easily. With the ability to suck out items from the bottom, a temporary item could have been used instead to fill slots that should be empty at the end, which then would be sucked out via an item filter. So allowing for even easier use by adding template, where you just have to point a hopper into the block and that's it, would be absolutely broken and destroy the joy that comes with redstone's simplicity and ways to figure out to use it in more complicated ways.</li>\n</ol>",

When checking for an item output instead of using 9 Redstone dust or subtracting 8 from the comparator we simply have the comparator facing into what we want to power 2.

This could be fixed with the slots setup being replaced with the ability to simply pick which item you want the Crafter to make when the necessary items are placed in it. Otherwise at the moment once the Crafter burns through the initial sugarcane I give it -regardless of enabled/disabled slots- it will just make sugar (rather then the paper I attempted to configure it for).</p>",

Moreso just an item that can connect a crafter to another block (chest, dropper, etc) without the risk of dropping items into the system accidentally like the hoppers currently enable.

And since iron is kind of easy to come by with iron farms, maybe make it cost iron blocks too?</p>\n<p>2) Also, maybe it should require a fuel source (like the brewing stand requires blaze powder) to help balance the use.</p>\n<p>3) Maybe add a way to craft up to a stack at a time since spamming smaller recipes may lag games (maybe the fuel like I noted above is only needed when crafting full stacks, but for single recipes you don't need fuel).</p>\n<p>4) Also the particles it produces seem to be kind of a lot, especially when spamming recipes, which may cause lag (especially if there are tons of crafters). Maybe decrease the particles, or maybe make a button in the interface to toggle them on/off.</p>\n<p>5) Also this one is kind of far stretched, but I feel like the crafter should be more of a late game block, which is why I noted diamonds and maybe iron blocks in the recipe. But, maybe to also force it to be more late game, players have to do something to actually unlock it's recipe. For example, maybe they have to find a blueprint in an ancient city that unlocks the recipe, or they have to complete an advancement. Things like that, that make it more difficult to obtain.</p>",

I can't say it more times, but the amount of hours this saves me in the game is just astounding.&nbsp;<br><br>Now for the actual feedback:<br><br>-The signal strength is quite useful and easy to understand, from 1-9. However, I'm not really sure if I preferred 1-15, since that would be easier to do some setups like automatic block crafters. But this is not a problem, not at all. There's ways to do it too, is just different. Imo, I prefer it like the current implementation.<br><br>-The fact that it behaves like a dropper is really really useful, and whoever made the crafter the ability to be placed in any orientation, chef kiss.<br><br>-The ability to such items from inside is just so good, this allows generic recipes which always have been my fear when suggesting an autocrafter for vanilla. I always thought it was going to be like mods and only allow for one recipe, but no, this is so good for advanced redstone.<br><br>-The fact that has no cooldown is so good, not so useful since you cannot really use that in many scenarios, but it's really nice that it actually can work with a 20hz clock.<br><br>-It works like a trapdoor in the sense that it gives an observer signal when powered, that's somehow useful. Although it would be even more useful if it gave block updates like the noteblock!<br><br>-My only complaint about the crafter is that is not easy to understand where is facing.&nbsp;</p>",

I think that'd be a better idea than just having it need items in a certain order like right now, however maybe it could instead be a thing where instead of disabling a slot on the crafter you instead \"lock\" it. If still empty it would work like it does now, no item will go in it, but if you put an item in a slot after locking it that slot is reserved for that item alone, always leaving one in that slot. That way if there are recipes that aren't in the book (like firework designs) they're still craftable, you have the use it currently has for a crafter that can just take in timed items and potentially it could also be used to sort items that aren't even technically a recipe (I.E. having all slots filled with different log types or stone). Not sure if that'd be possible but if so it could be similar to how the new copper lamps will be, a nice casual use for non-redstoners but a bit more depth for much more complicated builds as well. Either way excited to see where it goes :D</p>",

I am excited to get to use it to streamline certain aspects of the game:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How do you feel about the comparator signal used for the Crafter?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that the comparator signal used for the crafter makes sense. I would like to suggest that if there are two items in each slot that isn't toggled off that the crafter should give off a signal strength of more than nine. I think that this is a \"redstone\" way of adding \"recipe\" functionality to the block. For example if I wanted my crafter to craft a piston, I could insert the materials required to build one into the crafter. Then I could set up redstone to activate the crafter once two items are in each slot. This would allow a hopper feeding into the crafter to put items into the correct slots without needing to order them in any way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What do you think about the recipe used to make the Crafter - is it well balanced?&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that the recipe for the craft is well balanced. It requires enough materials to make it hard to use early game, but the materials used to craft it are not uncommon to have large amounts of later in the game. The crafter should not be any harder to obtain than a hopper or a observer.&nbsp;</p>",

Quasi-connectivity enables creative and efficient designs and would be a helpful addition to the crafter's behavior.<br><br>- I think having a <strong>comparator signal</strong> is useful, but I'm undecided whether 9 should be the maximum signal strength it outputs. I like the behavior of how blocked slots contribute to the signal strength, that way its possible to re-use designs that trigger based on a \"full\" signal strength for different recipes.</p>\n<p>- The <strong>toggleable slots</strong> are very useful, definitely intuitive. I prefer this mechanic over the idea of selecting a recipe which reserves empty slots for specific item types (like assemblers in factorio). Keep the toggleable slots.</p>\n<p>- The <strong>visuals</strong> are very cool and informative! I like how the grid on top flashes when crafting an item and the top corners flash when it gets a redstone signal! Since the texture changes every time it gets a pulse, (like observers or droppers) it's understandable that that causes observers facing the crafter to respond even when nothing is crafted. One could argue the crafter should only send observer updates when it successfully crafts an item.</p>\n<p>- <strong>Accessibility</strong>: The refilling slots mechanic greatly increases the accessibility for non-technical users and I think the feature will be well-received. I would however say the dropper-crafter disparity is non-intuitive.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your awesome work!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

But I understand it may be frustrating or daunting for those less familiar with redstone mechanics. \n<br />I propose a compromise: The crafter saves the recipe once it crafts something. Items for that recipe will enter into the slot it belongs in even if there are none in the crafter at the moment.\n<br />(Example: A saved cake recipe is missing 3 milk buckets and an egg. An egg enters the crafter first and goes directly into the center slot. Then milk buckets enter the crafter from top left to top right.)\n<br />However, if the crafter fails to craft something, or if an unrelated item enters the crafter, the saved recipe is lost.\n<br />The redstone is a bit simpler if you want to craft exactly one thing, but you still need to be careful that the crafter receives a redstone signal only when the recipe is complete and no junk enters the crafter. But skilled redstoners can create setups that craft multiple things with one crafter, and they can easily solve the problem of giving an empty crafter a redstone pulse to reset the recipe. </p>",

This way, in order to tell the crafter what item it should craft, the player should have to insert the materials in the correct form himself (like a regular crafting table) but instead of crafting the item, the crafter should display a \"lock\" button in the right part of the UI so the crafter \"saves\" that craft, showing what is the item that is currently locked fror crafting.

The reason is, filtering the slots is kinda hard and too finicky for more experienced redstone users (cause sometimes one late server tick just feed the wrong block in it time to time), and is a nightmare for players that doesn't use redstone that much (for sake of testing, i tried it with my wife, she loves the game, and is starting to learn about redstone, and she just got totally lost, she love that can just add a bunch of items and let them been crafted with a button or redstone clock, but she also pointed that would be nice to have the slots already set to just accept a certain items/filter by itself).<br><br>I think having the 10th power signal as a way to let one recipe on the crafter as a filter would be the most efficient and friendly with the game possible, also it will keep the vanilla feeling of it (cause figuring the redstone power usage, how to filter with comparators and stuff still intermediary challenge for new redstone users)<br><br>Recipe, design, toggleable slots is amazing how it is.</p>",

This recipe book is an extremely rare drop in trial chambers, and maybe also other structures such as the ancient cities? <br>Hopefully this would solve the problem of whether the crafter should have a recipe book. If you are a technical player, it would be much easier to use the crafter as it is, but if you are not, you could go to structures such as the trial chambers. This also provides extrinsic motivation by there being unique valuable loot in the trial chambers. Maybe it could be a rare drop in the pots.</p>\n<p>If having a recipe book would be too clunky, a way to lock the slots would be ideal. Maybe there's a copper lock on trial chamber doors and once you unlock them, you can use it on the crafter to lock it.</p>\n<p>My point is, there needs to be a way to more simply auto-craft, which is difficult to achieve but doesn't require you to be a technical player. Rare loot seems to be the best option.&nbsp;</p>",

With that said, I think it's reasonably approachable for casual players. There are many simple redstone setups which can be used to insert items in a specific order, and toggling slots provides an easy way to insert items in the correct shape. The comparator signal makes sense, and is not too difficult to detect for automation. Once the update goes live, there will surely be endless tutorials on how to build machines for shaped crafting of specific recipes. Machines which can be configured to craft any recipe are also possible, and provide a unique challenge to design and build.<br><br>However, I would like to propose one additional functionality for the crafter: <strong>The ability to fill and empty bundles.</strong> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To empty a bundle, a bundle can be placed in the crafting grid by itself; the crafter will output the emptied bundle along with its contents. To fill a bundle, place it in the crafting grid along with other items; the crafter will</span> output the filled bundle along with any items that did not fit inside.<br><br>This change would provide a reliable way to automate storage of items in bundles, and make it possible to sort bundles from other items (for example: attempting to fill a bundle with another bundle). I think the crafter is the perfect mechanism for this purpose.<br><br>Finally, for the concerns about lag: just fix MC-81098 already!</p>",

The types of builds that could take advantage of the single tick crafter delay were bulky and took a lot of effort to design to crafter as fast as they did for complicated recipes. The nerf is unneeded as it would take many of these complex machines to match the speed of player crafting since hundreds of crafts can be done in just a few seconds by a player. Aside from the crafting the crafter was also useful in making counters and clocks as it did not behave the same as a dropper.

        "body": "<p>I think it would be cool if the crafter had a special mode like a comparator, which would allow it to lock/unlock slots based on the signal strength of Redstone going into the side of the crafter. The first 9 signal strengths should each be dedicated to toggling a single slot in the crafter. Let's say we pressed a button which sends a redstone signal with a strength of 7 into the crafter. This would toggle the lower left corner of the crafter (slot 7). If that slot was enabled (unlock), it would then disable (lock) it and vice versa. Even after the button is pressed, the crafter would still remember its previous inputs, so you could design a redstone machine that creates the configuration of slots you want. If I sent the sequence 5 and then 7 for example, it would lock slots 5 and 7 and give us the crafting configuration for leggings. There's even 6 more Redstone signals you could use. I think signal strength 15 should be dedicated to enabling all of the slots and 14 should be disable all of the slots. There are still 4 more signal strengths that could be used, so many we could save custom configurations in the crafter. The crafter slots would still be configurable manually for non-technical players.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, I think it makes more intuitive sense for the items to be released from the top of the crafter instead of on the side. It could work like a dropper where if a container is directly above it, the items will automatically be transferred between them.</p>",

It is clear that most have not been patched because of their usefulness and community dependence on them (e.g., TNT tree farm). Now with the addition of the crafter, these duplication glitches/bugs could be removed. For example, carpets can now sustainably be farmed through automatic sheep shearing and then crafted into carpets instead of duplicating carpets. One issue remaining preventing this full removal of duplication glitches: <strong>sand needs to be made renewably</strong>. Most mods have some sort of grinder which will grind stone to cobble, cobble to gravel, gravel to sand. It is clear that the limiting factor is primarily community reliance on TNT duplication and by simply adding a method to grind down cobble stone to sand, the community could finally have automatically restocking TNT-based farms in an ethical way. This has been flagged by Mojang employees on social media many times previously. The solution is really quite simple now that there is a crafter, the sand is the limiting factor.<br>Given that 1.21 is a redstone focused update, this would be the perfect opportunity to also add a renewable method of sand production that is better than relying on wandering traders and patch duplication exploits.

However, there is an issue I would like to point out. If you wanted to make a small automatic paper farm, you can’t without player interaction because you end up getting masses of sugar instead.\n<br />I do have two suggestions that could solve this:\n<br />1. If you click on the box that shows the crafted item, a list of every item shows up. All you have to do is click on an item name, e.g. paper, and, as long as the correct items are arranged in the right way to create the item you want, when a redstone signal is emitted, it creates that item. You would still have to work out the recipe yourself to create the item you want.\n<br />2. My other suggestion is to do with the toggle-able slots where the items fall into. If you put 1 sugar cane in and 1 slot was activated, sugar would be created. However, if you put 1 sugar cane in and the top 3 slots were activated, nothing would come out once a redstone signal was emitted. You would have to put 3 sugar canes inside to make an item fall out (paper would be that item in this case). If 4 slots were activated and 4 sugar canes were put inside, nothing happens once redstone activates the Crafter. This is because there isn’t an item that requires this recipe.\n<br />I hope this problem can be solved so that people can create automatic paper farms their own way. Hope this makes sense and thanks for reading</p>",

I imagine the item would only be interesting in a PVP situation where the enemy is shooting arrows, and you destabilize them.</p>\n\n<p> The item does not focus on its usefulness, but on quantity.  You would easily fill 2 packs in your inventory, so you can use it in combat, if you are going to use it, as it does not deal damage.</p>\n\n<p> In the end, I think the usefulness of this item could be aimed at parkour, as it can be used to jump 4 blocks high.  It would be interesting if you could use it to explode beneath you, in the air, to reach heights you couldn't reach before.  With the projectile as a launch, it would not be possible to do this, as you are thrown upwards, fall, and only then can you use it to rise again.</p>\n\n<p> I wonder, what would be the use of this item in combat?</p>",

        "body": "<p>A couple of thoughts:</p>\n<p>1. Currently, wind charges pop when they hit <em>any </em>block, solid or not. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but it does make them difficult to weaponize on natural terrain when you miss your target because you clipped some tall grass by mistake. And with breezes being as rare as they currently are, <strong>accidentally wasting one of those things is pretty painful.</strong></p>\n<p>2. Instead of splitting the weaker, player-thrown wind charge and the stronger, breeze-spawned wind charge into two separate entity IDs (minecraft:wind_charge and breeze_wind_charge), it would be a lot more helpful for mapmakers if the range and knockback strength were NBT flags in the entity data.</p>\n<p>3. I agree with the sentiment that if wind charges are throwable, fire charges should probably also be made throwable. Right now they're just sort of a worse flint and steel, and that's significantly less mechanically interesting than a long-ranged weaponized light source.</p>\n<p>4. Right now the sound effects seem <em>very </em>loud.</p>\n<p>But if you take away one thing from this, it should really be to ask yourself <strong>if this item's usefulness offsets its relative rarity</strong>. Breezes only spawn from trial spawners, and trial spawners have a <strong>30 minute cooldown</strong>. A player might be disinclined to use a weapon that can easily miss and deals minimal damage <strong>if they can only get a few dozen of them per hour</strong>, especially when other items that produce similar-enough effects (punch bows, slow falling potions, <strong>ender pearls</strong>) can be more easily obtained.</p>",

So id say, easer make the breeze drop more of them (8 to 12 maybe ?), or, let us make some kind of tool or weapon that can throw many more charges, or, make it duplicable (maybe a wind charge and a phantom membrane in a crafting table gives us 4 charges ?)</p>\n<p>2 - its a great vertical movement tool, but it doesnt do anything horizontaly. Maybe the charge could work like rocket launchers from quake or tf2 ? where launching the charge slighty in front or behind us changes the angle at wich we are trown around. Letting us cross gaps, take up speed, jump from wall to wall or pogo on the ground while bulding momentum</p>",

In terms of vertical movement, being able to traverse walls of six blocks or higher without an elytra or building oneself up, it is extremely useful. But considering it's minimal impact on horizontal movement, that is really all it can be used for in traversing. Maybe wind charges thrown at walls could boost horizontally (alongside a small vertical boost to help traverse gaps)?<br><br>It's nice that they are renewable, but it is rather tedious to acquire large amounts of them, and when used to traverse cliffs and mountains on a longer journey (or a cave system), they deplete rather quickly. Having to pass through multiple trial chambers repeatedly to get a steady supply is rather unfun. Potentially, trial spawners that summon breezes could have a large chance to dispense charges (replacing some of the other generic loot, not the trial keys).</p>",

The following changes would allow for more options for all levels of skill. Firstly I'd enhance the horizontal knock-back to depend more on the momentum of the player and angle. Second of all, I'd make the range for the optimal angle for usage more lenient and not rely on overly precise measurements, where I've seen players use pixel measurements to reach the absolute pinnacles of 90/100 block high boosts. Third and lastly, I'd allow for some higher degree of stacking mid-air, but not making it too easy, the skill element should be factored in there while making the calculations.</p>\n<p>Overall a very unique and meta-changing item - I've played around with it already and I can't wait to incorporate it into my regular survival worlds and multiplayer servers. 8.5/10</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The 4-6 charge drops per kill is OK, but trial keys could be used to immediately reactivate the spawners for easier farming, or we could craft a breeze rod with mending instead, that has a much slower fire rate than breeze charges. This makes the shots more usable while still giving breeze charges an edge over the staff, and this will allow useless items like echo shards as crafting ingredients, giving an actual reason to explore the deep dark.</p>\n\n<p>Breezes/chambers finally have a use in this update... IF the wind charges are better. I like the wolf buffs, but having to constantly heal them is still a huge burden &amp; they can slowly regen like allay, axolotl, horse. I was happy that trial chambers seem to be repeatable dungeons, but with vaults being one-use junk blocks that I need to remove, it counters that idea.

One thing I'd love to see is a way to activate a charge beneath you while you're already airborne, I think it would really expand the fun of it.</p>\n\n<p>My favourite feature of the charges is the one I've not seen anyone mentioning, the redstone capabilities. A fast moving projectile with no drop-off that can interact with components like levers and trapdoors was interesting when a mob was in control of them. In the players hands they're remote controls for redstone contraptions. If you can see it you can activate it. I'm so excited to use these if that feature makes it to full release, though it's lack of mention in the patch notes has me fearing it was an oversight, never meant to be included in the item version.</p>",

Combat side, could use more knockback to effectively reposition or stall mobs as it only seems to send mobs a maximum 4 blocks.</p>\n<p>I feel like this item could feel more worth its rarity if the knockback was tweaked in terms of power and functionality.</p>\n<p>Players can get 10 block jumps by timing their upwards velocity when jumping with the blast force to amplify it, or even 30 block wall climbs with precise angling and timing. The vertical utility is good (and while technical, the prospect of more high skill ceiling mobility options in minecraft is really cool), but it's only good vertically (maybe by design, but horizontal utility would be nice too).</p>\n<p>I think the knockback angle should be dependent on the direction the blast hits the player. Right now, it feels like a set launch angle (strong vertically, very weak horizontally) where the strongest part of the blast is the middle and it gets weaker the further out (resulting in weak launches anywhere other than blasting directly below you and not too much variation in jump angles).</p>\n<p>That aside, stronger knockback would help in combat to push mobs farther (and for movement, it stops the slightest downward momentum from nullifying knockback). As detailed, the horizontal knockback isn't great, and the vertical knockback is dependant on amplifying upwards momentum. This would also benefit from not having to hit the feet to get a good launch</p>",

They should also be able to be found exclusively in vaults, or as a reward from the trial spawner, but if that happens, the quantity of wind charges dropped by the Breeze would have to decrease.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for how they work, the throwing arc should not be as varied. It should go in a mostly straight line, but maybe it has a lower chance of hitting the target if the target is further away from the player. Also, I'm not sure if the wind charges that the player throws also affect Redstone stuff, but if it doesn't, then it should.&nbsp; The parkour and jumping stuff you can do it with seems fine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The wind charges should also be able to put out fires and should do extra damage to blazes. Also, if they aren't already, breezes should be immune to damage by wind charges whether or not they're thrown by the player or other breezes, and should either reflect them like other projectiles, take no damage, or be healed by them.</p>",

And it's not just a gimmick, it actually works really well? It opens up so many creative possibilities and it's well balanced due to its source. It could use a little polish*, sure, but it's honestly in quite a fun state for being the first iteration.</p>\n<p>Please, do not go the route of making this item a worthless gimmick.</p>\n<p><em>Note: I have spent way too much time rocket jumping in other games.</em></p>\n<p>*Chaining jumps feels a little inconsistent, and it comes down to four things:</p>\n<p>1. Minecraft's player momentum is a bit... weird? It's a combination of how quickly you slow down and the weak air control. Not sure if this should be changed, though. Maybe a potion that reduces air friction and increases air control? Could use wind charges for the recipe.</p>\n<p>2. The blast radius feels a little small for use on yourself, but that may just be down to my muscle memory being tuned for different blast jumping mechanics, plus issue 3.</p>\n<p>3. The range of knockback you get from your own blast is wild. Basically none at the edge and tons at the center doesn't feel great. Clamping min and max to, Idk, 50%-80% current power might be a good solution.</p>\n<p>4. The projectile comes out of your head and is really fast, so it's very hard to get it beneath your feet when you try to chain a jump off a wall.</p>",

Of course, with the properties of taking fall damage below the blast point, that wouldn't lead to fall damage on flat terrain. But if it launched entities high enough and long enough that you could air shot them, it would reset the fall damage calculation from the new blast point. A skilled player would be able to chain a few air shots with good predictive aim, and it could introduce a unique form of combat.</p>\n<p>It may be more or less effective than simply using other ranged options (probably less effective considering how much skill it would take to juggle), but it's fun idea to have fall damage based combat (assuming there's open air and the opponent can't save themselves from fall damage), and it would be fun to watch a skilled player use it like this.

Also, I don’t think that wind charges should boost players that are in the water. We already have the Riptide enchantment for that. I hope this makes sense.</p>",

The boost height feels just right and I had no trouble figuring it out. <br>I assumed that I could use the Wind Charge to boost myself upward when close to landing on the ground while flying with an Elytra, but I was disappointed when it didn't do something interesting when I used an Elytra and a Wind Charge together because they're both mobility items.<br><br>The particle effect for the Wind Charge looks great, its distinct from normal explosions and looks fittingly wispy. I love the puffy sounds too!<br><br>When I tried to hit a pig directly with a wind charge, I expected it to send them flying back away from me, and I was confused when it seemingly didn't work. I read one of the comments on this thread that mentions aiming precisely to send them upward instead of away, and that was very fun when I tried it in game! When using the item, I expected it to always do something interesting when I hit a mob with the projectile and didn't know I should aim at the ground just below them to get a full knocking effect.<br>I'm having a lot of fun with this item!

What if you add elements to the game? No not the education edition stuff, fire, water, earth, and wind. If you don't do something like that, you might just leave the breeze and blaze out of place and awkwardly similar. This could make minecraft 1.21: The element update or something like that. It could be on the same level as 1.16! Also, great idea with the mace and wind charges working together. We want more complex combat like that.</p>",

This potion is a throwable potion and it affects a bigger area than splash or lingering potions. This potion spreads leaving a huge ring before it instantly disappears. It starts from one block and finishes in a radius of ten blocks away from the block it was thrown on to. Any mobs that touch it will be affected. If you want to avoid the potions effects all you would have to do is jump over it when it approaches. Be careful though because, if you throw the potion too close to yourself, you have to react very quickly. Once you throw it, it takes 1 second to spread completely before it disappears</p>\n<p>I have also created a post about it. It says the same thing this comment says so you don’t have to read it.

As it stands right now, Minecraft's movement is a bit tedious if one doesn't have an elytra, so giving the player immediate access to wind charges would make it more fun. For example, climbing a mountain in Minecraft can be boring, but what if you rocket-launched and wall-jumped (people have done that with wind charges) yourself up on top of it; it would open up gateways of creativity regarding how to explore the blocky world.</p>\n<p>To balance the player's wind chargers, they wouldn't do any damage and they would only push back the player who used them. Moreover, there would be a short cooldown on using the wind charges, similar to how they work currently.</p>\n<p>\"But wouldn't that remove the niche of the Breeze?\" you may ask. To fix this problem, Breezes would drop special wind charges that <strong>do</strong> inflict damage to enemies and launch them backward, and to a higher degree than that of the player's wind charges. Another way to fix this problem would be to have Breezes occasionally drop a boot enchantment that would increase the power of the player's wind charges and decrease the cooldown on them.</p>",

Elytra are very frustrating to use for short distance vertical mobility. </p>",

For almost every challenge the game throws you, there's a way to still engage fully while not encountering penalties—an escape hatch. Torches are a simple example—mobs spawn in the dark, if you want some area to be safe, light it up. Some escape hatches are better than others (for instance, forcing players to sleep to avoid the phantom limits free play, in my opinion). <br><br>Only in recent years have certain exceptions to this principle popped up, namely the Pillager outposts. Here is a structure on the surface that endlessly spawns hostile mobs—meaning the overworld, a place generally guaranteed to be safe except at night—is no longer. One expects hostility in the Nether, and even then, various hostile mobs can be placated (fungus scares hoglins, gold distracts piglins). On the surface, now, if you happen to find an awesome place to settle and its near an outpost, you can expect constant incursions. If the pillagers spawn from trial spawners in the outpost, it would let users who don't want the constant attacks to turn it off, and users who want to keep looting to do so too.<br><br>Beyond vaults allowing for multiple elytra loot drops, why not enhance the replayability of the stronghold by adding both blocks? The stronghold is now less challenging than the trial chamber, and there could be loot there to help fight the dragon (within reason, e.g. jack-o-lanterns).</p>",

Second, give it a unique loot that has depth and purpose outside of the trial chambers. Preferably something related to combat. You guys should give the trial chambers multiple unique loots, maybe an item that can be combined with echo shards or amethyst shard or glow berries that gives benefit in combat. Lastly, this new item which allows you to dash at the direction youre moving with the joystick/wasd that has a 0.5 second cooldown, while keeping the sound design and visual standards. As well as, adding more mob variations, as simple as giving the mobs weapon and armour and effect buffs.&nbsp;</p>",

I can tell lots of nice stuff about the vaults, but then my feedback would be useless. I just want to address some of the issues that I found while playing. First of all, other players can easily \"steal\" your loot from the vaults while they're being dispensed out. This has happened while I first tested it out with a group of friends, in our first vault block. I don't have much to say about the current situation about the vault, mainly because it doesn't change much and I like it this way, but I can suggest you stuff about the future of the vaults. I think the vault SHOULDN'T spawn in other structures, (except two that I'll be talking about in a moment) because it would overcomplicate getting loot, and I think it is nice as it is, other structures do not need an overhaul about loot gathering. The only two exceptions (other than trial chamber, of course) are:</p>\n<p>-End city.</p>\n<p>-Bastion.</p>\n<p>Well, I think there should be just one vault in bastions that contains a few netherite upgrades, so all the players can get netherite upgrades fairly in a server, and not just a few players will be OP. Also, end cities can have them because lets face it, even if you aren't a good player you can get an elytra in day 10.</p>\n<p>-Extra: Ancient cities are too easy I can loot one without even iron armor add extra dangers there and some combatable mobs because it is combat update .</p>",

Specially since minecraft usually has multiple uses for each block allowing us to be more creative about how to use those blocks. Some interesting ideas I have seen are making it able to be re-used by the same player after a while, encouraging replayability of the trial chambers; another idea is to be able to get it as a block for displaying items in your base, kind of like an item frame. I am sure that there are many more things that can fit really well with this block but adding extra features specially for singleplayer would be great!</p>",

But texture-wise, it's too similar to the spawner : idk if it's because i'm dyslexic, but i struggle to distinguish them while in-game/in-combat, it just looks like there is two times as many spawners if i dont look closely. Also, the face of the vault doesnt always face the obvious direction, wich hides it, and then makes the block look even more like a spawner.</p>\n<p>The game would really benefit from having vaults in every important structure (it also gives more value to the trial key), but the texture(again) of the vault seems made really specificly for the trial chamber, and would probably not fit well in other structure; so there is maybe need for a visual redesign ?</p>\n<p>Seeing the items inside is really cool but they are a bit hard to see, i suggest moving the gray/orange bar from the upper part of the vault to the bottom, since it's the part of the texture that hides the items the most.</p>\n<p>Finaly, the loot is ... meh, its technicly not tooo bad, but its very undesirable/boring, and there is maybe too much unstackable items. In general i feel like loot seems always more interesting when it gives you ingrediants for items more than the items themself, exemple from other structures : diamonds, good enchanted books, echo shards, disc fragments, netherite scrap/ingots, nautilus shells, smithing templates, ... etc; stuff like that should probably be the norm.</p>",

I feel the failed unlock sound is similar to the successful unlock sound, and doesn't entirely sound like I've been \"denied\". Maybe the vault could shake when you try to use the wrong item, like with pots?</p>\n<p>— To me, it is clear now what key you need to use to unlock the vault, but this is because there's only one key. I'm not sure how the required key/item would be communicated if multiple keys are used in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>— With the current spawner loot table, keys tend to build up quite quickly. Whilst their chance to appear could be lowered, I also think it would be fun if 1-2 vaults per chamber required multiple keys. Maybe they have the best treasure, and players have to build up keys over one or multiple runs to unlock them?</p>\n<p>— With the current vault loot table, the large amount of non-stackable items fills up the inventory very quickly. This is less of a problem with chests, because you have a chance to look at each item in the UI and swap them with those in your inventory.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, this is a really fun block!

Breeze still has no drops. But at least this update is better than 1.20, as there's some actual content to play.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with these vaults is that they're useless in singleplayer, and they don't give further rewards for players that want to repeat spawner combats and get more keys, which is the point of the trial chambers. I think the vaults should be repeatedly usable for one player, and they could be a source of renewable items like diamonds. Players can only use each vault block once every in-game day to prevent OP diamond farming. The vault reward should be enticing enough to encourage repeating the dungeon!</p>\n\n<p>Unless the vaults and trial spawners are on every Minecraft structure, the vaults don't really solve the problem of one player getting all the loot. It's not a problem that requires solving, if on multiplayer sessions a friend keeps unfairly stealing loot, then players are better off playing with someone that shares?</p>\n\n<p>I like how the vaults made sure that each player will get something by exploring the dungeon, even though it may have been \"completed\" by another. But we really need the vaults to be reusable by each player so the trial chambers have actual replayability, creating all sorts of minigame activities on servers.</p>",

Since the loot for a vault is able to remember each player and who has opened it and who hasn't, it could be interesting if the loot itself actually varied based on the player. Some mechanisms that could work for this could be either getting the current player's number of enchanted tools and what tier those tools are, so that someone showing up in unenchanted iron armor would get vastly different loot than someone showing up in fully enchanted netherite, or if that's too difficult from a coding perspective, they could base it off the number of recipes unlocked in a person's crafting recipe list, since someone with more unlocked recipes is likely to have held more items from more dimensions and thus be further along in the game, so someone with only a few recipes unlocked would get lower tier loot from a vault, and someone with lots of unlocked recipes would get the most elite loot from a vault. Vaults are already locked to individual players, so it would be cool if you got better loot from them the further along in the game you are. It could add an incentive to save a vault for later to get the more elite equipment, but also still be a valuable place for early game players.</p>",

I feel like the vault has a lot of potential but falls flat due to the inability to use Trial Chambers over and over. The Trial Spawners allow for replayability and give their own loot outside of keys but they also have a chance to give multiple keys over each subsequent usage.</p>",

The visual indicators for being able to open one (or it being locked) are very clear, and the sound design is honestly one of the best examples of such in the game so far.&nbsp;<br><br>My only real issue is the loot. Now, obviously, the loot table is very much a work in progress, and will definetly change over time, but even if such things as likelihood rebalancing and unique loot are added, there are issues with it.<br>1.) There are just too many damn unstackables! This is already a pretty big issue in most other lootable structures, but with the vault, where loot is quite literally thrown in your face, the inventory gets clogged up with things like saddles, tools and horse armor really quickly. When looting a trial chamber (I only had the bare minimum of items with me, a stack of food, an axe &amp; sword, a bow and some arrows), inventory management was very doable, but as soon as vaults were at play, my inventory usually filled up with stuff I did not need extremely quickly, forcing me to discard it.<br>2.) Less of the \"generic filler loot\"! This would be remedied if the unstackables were toned down, but there are already enough structures to get your fill of saddles. Additionally, as soon as one structure is looted, any gear progression through the structure would be minimized upon further looting. Focusing on rare materials (like diamonds) and stuff like wind charges would greatly set it apart from the other structures.</p>",

Add these vaults to pre-existing locations. A vault at the top of a pillager Outpost. A single vault in the Jungle Temple. Or the horribly needed Ocean Monument, This will make it so if we cleared one of the structures out, find the key and then head back there for rare loot.</span></p>\n<p>Also, as for we who usually only plays single player. Maybe a toggle on world creation that will allow us to open the same vault multiple times, but lock it behind say like defeat the trial spawners 25 times in the structure before it gets more loot.</p>",

For example, if the Vault is showing Emeralds, you get Emeralds. This would allow players to not end up with rewards they don’t want. If the item is enchanted, you don’t know what enchantment is on it unless you unlock the Vault. This would give players more of a ‘reward’ and a reason to unlock the Vaults</p>",

I only say this because the loot inside the vaults, apart from the new &amp; unique loot, has only been the same relatively mid-tier armor and utilities. </p>\n\n<p>Given that the trial chambers serve as a mid-game challenge, the loot in the vaults should accomodate for that, so any type of player on any kind of difficulty are able to make a jump in the game's natural progression, but only if they can find them.</p>\n\n<p>To do this, have regular chests generate in the trials like in their first snapshot, but make it so vaults can take the place of any said chests under a lower chance. This can do two things: </p>\n\n<p>1. Elevate the value of the vaults(and the trial key, more on that later*)\n<br />AND\n<br />2. Maintain a balance for players so they can't be spoon-fed to endgame levels of power.</p>\n\n<p>In short, these vault changes in the trial chambers should be done to provide players with enough power and equipment to atleast survive the nether, after clearing 1-3 of these, on any high difficulty.</p>\n\n<p>*With this new value, trial keys should have a reduced 1/3 chance of being dispensed by a trial spawner, so every trial chamber you clear leaves the player with one or no extra trial keys, once all vaults have been opened. However, this idea gears closer to inventory management.</p>\n\n<p>What are your thoughts?</p>\n\n<p>P.S: Thx for reading! </p>",

Don't get me wrong I like mining for things, I don't like having to ask the time, as there is farming and lots of other stuff to do. Also feel that when taking your friends out creates a lot more fun for you all to adventure together and honestly the loot isn't the same for each person which is cool. I might need a chest piece that my friend got while they might need another pairing of leggings etc... I feel this furthers the work of the last bunch of updates that had given minecraft more of a history but still keeping it a sandbox game! The sounds make me feel like I'm in a scary dungeon with some sweet stuff completing it. Not sure if the vaults are supposed to recharge like the spawners of they are great! Currently I have not had one respawn. Otherwise you end with way too many keys. The cool down on spawners and vaults should be increased either way or one or the other. I feel that could mix things up pretty nice. The longer cool down would allow for completion of the trial and do different to encourage exploration to find more and still be encouraged to go back to one's you already did again. Maybe an hour cooldown on both?</p>",

Ideas about preventing the loot from being stolen by other players\n<br />(1) Treasure Troves can be turned into ender chest-like containers, which can only be opened and discovered by players who have unlocked the Vault\n<br />(2) You can add an Owner's nbt tag to the drops, and the Owner tag is an item that other players cannot pick up, and the tag lasts for a period of time. Based on the above design, when the player opens the Vault, the Vault sets the Owner tag for the key user for the drop</p>",

Here's my story and some suggestions for structure loot.</p>\n<p>I went to 10 trial chambers to get the new items in the update. My friend came with for the first four and we got everything except the Precipice disc. I went solo to the remaining chambers and finally got it. (Together it essentially took 14 chambers of loot to obtain.) The wiki says it should take 28 vaults on average to obtain, but I opened double, probably triple of that.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3 simple solutions and 2 more complex solutions:</p>\n<p>1. Generally increase the drop percentage on the loot table.</p>\n<p>2. Make the vault in the tree room have a 100% chance to give the disc</p>\n<p>3. Make vaults reusable</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. Add a 'pity' mechanic to vaults. If [player] hasn't obtained [item] in # of attempts, future attempts have increased odds. Odds reset after [item] has been obtained. (Could be applied to all rare items actually.)</p>\n<p>5. Increase the frequency vaults generate. I noticed that ominous vaults were guaranteed to generate once per room, but the regular ones were frequently missing. (I found a whole chamber that only had 3 regular and 6 ominous vaults.) Each room should have a regular and ominous vault guaranteed.</p>",

The chance of closing a vault could be 1/128 since in servers you need 128 players to make vaults renewable.</p>",

Get lucky enough to get a trial key, get lucky enough to get an ominous bottle from the orange vault, get lucky enough to get the ominous vault key, and THEN get lucky enough to get the loot you want from the non-renewable ominous vaults. That’s four luck rolls in a row, and running out of vaults means time to search for a new trial chamber, or running out of keys means time to grind monsters. I had to farmify a trial chamber and create a pillager farm just to get the heavy core and Creator disc from the third trial chamber we visited. I don’t think normal, redstone-unsavvy players should have to do this. Loot odds rebalancing is the only fix I can think of without overhauling the whole system</p>",

I will say, I've really liked the idea that I've seen some members of the community suggest though, of having water and lava be able to flow through the copper grate as if it wasn't there. For the contraptional utility, sure, but I also think it'd be neat just for the sake of cool decorational elements.</li>\n<li>The copper trapdoors and doors are cool textures, but the fact they're crafted with copper <em>blocks</em> makes them feel very expensive, and difficult to build with in survival. I feel as though it'd be better if they were crafted with ingots, like we have for iron doors and trapdoors, so that they feel worthwhile to use in a build.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, very cool snapshot!

I think it would be better if they stored the signal strength that turned them on until turned off again. For example, a signal strength of 10 lighting a copper bulb will cause the lit copper bulb to still output a signal strength of 10 when read by a comparator.<br><br>Additionally, the oxidization state of bulbs could subtract from the signal strength. For example an exposed copper bulb would turn a signal of strength 9 into a signal of strength 8.</p>\n<p><strong>Copper Doors and Trapdoors:</strong></p>\n<p>It would be nice if these also toggled with a redstone pulse, like the copper bulb does.

But you can make much more compact door designs if it is possible to toggle the door state instead of keeping it open with a permanent signal.<br><br>I also like the special effect of copper that it has multiple oxidation states. So I suggest giving the copper doors, like the light bulb, a special effect for more oxidized doors/trap doors. I think it could be very nice if you can open the normal door/trapdoor with only one click. and then it needs an extra click for each oxidized state. So that for the last state you need 4 clicks to open the door completely. (So with each click the door is opened a little bit further.<br><br>If the redstone thing (toggle doors/trapdoors with a signal) is \"accepted\", you could make it so that the oxidized door takes several redstone pulses to open or close completely. With this mechanic you can add much more detail and usage to the doors/trapdoors than just doors and trapdoors.<br><br>In addition, there would be significantly more opportunities for adventure worlds, for example.</p>",

We already have odd gametick delay blocks (pistons, leaves, scaffolding, sculk sensors). The copper bulb brought something new to this family of blocks.

Since copper bulbs will be functionally replacing T flip-flops in a huge number of situations, redstoners would benefit from having more options for signal strength coming out of these blocks.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, copper bulbs with variable comparator signal strengths would create a new way to detect the oxidation level of copper, which could have a number of uses. While the state change from one oxidation level to another can currently be detected by an observer, there’s not currently a way to detect (in isolation) a copper block’s specific oxidation level. Allowing unwaxed copper bulbs to change the signal strength they give off as their oxidation level increases would be a totally new method of input, which would change at semi-random intervals.

There is little reason to continue doing it, much less at higher omen levels, if they vaults aren't reusable. I'm just collecting keys. Please make the vaults reusable, and perhaps add variance to the trial spawners loot table based on the mob they spawn. This would encourage continued exploration.</p>",

That felt like something that was missing that would be a great addition to the game. Especially on a realm that's been around for a while. I thought something was broken when we couldn't loot the vaults after clearing the chamber for a second time. Its confusing, and a bit frustrating to keep getting keys without being able to use them after completing the challenge a second time. The two objects (trial spawners and vaults) are paired, so they should work together in a predictable way. Either they should only drop keys once and be looted once, or they should both be renewable. Being renewable would be better in my opinion.</p>",

Additionally, the drop rate of certain items (especially heavy core which seems to switch to a different item very quickly compared to others), are very rare, meaning in order to obtain it you need to go to several chambers. While cartographers, only give the same map every time you buy it (for bedrock its the same map for all villagers) which makes it very difficult to locate one. It makes sense for the spawner cooldowns, only if someone wanted a supply of decent food and potions while the key part isnt useful if each vault can only be used once per player.</p>",

        "body": "<p>The breeze is the type of mob perfect for pve combat, the theme of this structure. I love the idea and find its implementation into the chambers well done.</p>\n<p><strong>Challenge:&nbsp;</strong>The breeze is somewhat difficult. There are a few bugs regarding its projectiles and it sometimes wont run away or even fight back as you hit it with a sword but when the experience works, it works. The fact it redirects arrows makes sense thematically and gives it a serious challenge. Shields can block its direct attacks but its knockback and blowback still impact a player. Combined with other hostile mobs, it creates a very chaotic and fun environment. Once I found myself overwhelmed by skeletons so I ran out and closed a door behind me, thinking I was safe, only to have a breeze open the door to allow all the skeletons to follow me out of the chamber! Early strategies for me involve breaking line of sight (it almost seems to ignore you if you hide behind a wall sometimes), waiting until it seems to have settled down, and rushing it. Despite being a flying mob, it sometimes doesn't seem to want to go down more than 1 block intervals, so when it gets isolated on a platform it wont run away as much. This feels like a bug.</p>\n<p><strong>Visuals:&nbsp;</strong>A few bugs here as well (I see them all in the tracker already) but wonderful work as well. I think the eyes could be a bit more pronounced. The movement animations pair nicely with its somewhat rapid flying. I know this is in early stages but nice work!</p>",

This could justify the low damage of the wind attacks. </p>\n\n<p>Blaze fire charges, and breeze wind charges, should be craftable into a magic staff, using copper and amethyst to make them useful.

I've some extra feedback regarding Minecraft LIVE. They should ideally introduce new things that create excitement for the community. Something like an End or Aether update will definitely give a surge on Minecraft's sales as youtubers create hype. The Breeze would definitely fit on the Aether. I understand that the devs aren't showing much to avoid overpromising, so maybe we can show these when it's mostly completed? Lately, LIVE is very underwhelming and it's filled with ads.</p>",

Not to mention, having to switch between winded arrows and normal arrows is a pain. What we really need is a new breeze weapon that you can use repeatedly. Being able to jump around caves and cliffs, pushing piglins into lava, it's going to create amazing gameplay!</p>\n\n<p>There was a better post to make fletching table useful, you can just craft the tipped arrows here, simply by using the pointless early-game items like spider eye. With this, players can finally be introduced to the tipped arrows early, which are so niche and hard-to-get that few players know about it. Having to collect ender dragon breaths, to craft lingering potions, and then throwing them and using the arrows on the pool to create tipped arrows, that's something that no player will be able to figure out on their own.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with people that the breeze is really not a threat at all. Big rooms with open platforms and elevation will definitely make it more of a challenge, as well as the breeze activating those lingering potion traps. Add more of those lingering potions with a variety of effects. Don't make it too dangerous and destructive like desert TNT.</p>",

Don't just make it consumables like fire charges, it's annoying to farm. It would be very interesting if we have wands for the four elements, like earth and water. To prevent blaze wands from being too destructive, we can turn it into a flamethrower that only sets mobs on fire, not the environment. Or an explosive shot that doesn't actually destroy blocks. These are great for fighting multiple mobs.</p>\n<p>Overall I like where this update is going. There's a lot of combat fun to be had on minecraft realms, and there's even crafters for redstoners, and these nice copper grates look good for builders. This is what minecraft updates should strive for. The trial chambers are well-designed with crawl spaces and copper themed floors, and adding a boss room will complete the package.&nbsp;</p>",

Furthermore, he could become immune to arrows at some key moments of the battle to force the player to attack him at close range.</p>\n\n<p> As for what he can drop, I suggest an item that could be used to make a kind of beacon or conduit that would give the effect of feather falling or resistance to the player. Or perhaps he can drop sticks that can be used to create \"homing\" arrows with infinite range or with a wider range level;  or even if cause an explosion of wind when reaching the target.  Another suggestion for an item that he could drop would be a \"wind charge\" that would give a boost or make the player reach very high places.  It could be used in an item similar to a bow, where the longer you hold it, the stronger is the shot.  To recharge this item, you would need more sticks or the item dropped by the Breeze.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Hi, mojang! The breeze is one of my favourite mobs ever added since the Tricky Trials update. The additions of the Mace, Wind Burst, Density, and Breach enchantments, and the Wind Charge projectile really had me thinking “Can mojang expand on this update?” So, here’s an idea that i wanted to be added. The breeze storm: Breeze storms have a 3% chance of happening on thunderstorms. On breeze storms, breezes will start to spawn. A new mob called the Gale will spawn when you defeat at least 3 breezes that spawned. It’s just a mob with the same appearance of the breeze, but 9 blocks tall, has the little rectangle arms similar to the Warden or any other hostile mob with arms, has extra limbs as well. It throws wind charges at you from its 4 arms, and can do a special wind blast ability, pushing you back, similar to the Warden’s Sonic Boom. Just as the Breeze can do, it can jump, dash, but it can also catch you in its tornado for 2 seconds if you are within 7 blocks of it. I think it would be a cool addition, and make thunderstorms more dangerous. Forgot to add, but on death, when you kill the Gale, it drops 5-12 Breeze Rods, and something called the Wind Shield as a 23% drop. It has a special ability, that if you hit it, it does damage and blasts you back, similar to a Wind Charge. It’s like the patterns you make, like how a wither skeleton leads to a wither, a breeze leads to a Gale, and if the Wildfire was in the game, a Blaze leads to the Wildfire! Your game is awesome!</p>",

The breakable pots with loot are a very nice addition, it feels like Zelda dungeons, and in the future pots should also be placed&nbsp;in other structures like jungle/ocean temples. You can add Sniffer eggs in them, as they're currently so rare that many casual players miss the mob entirely.</p>\n\n<p>I hope the Breeze will deal more damage on hard mode. Right now, the Breeze doesn't have any unique useful drops, and we haven't had mobs with cool drops since 1.13 drowned tridents. I'm worried how exciting new things tend to be watered-down by the devs for the sake of simplicity, as this is usually the trend lately. The spawner loot are unfortunately common items and decorative junk so far. We could add more interesting loot like lingering potions (which nobody uses as it's too hard to get) or copper golem parts to craft, which fits well with the copper dungeon and the tinkering theme. This will also ease the recent controversies, on how players are scared that losing mobs will permanently disappear, leading to so many fights every year. I hope the new armadillo armor will be useful and easy to farm, wolves need fire/fall resist and HP regen, as manually healing them is a chore.</p>\n\n<p>The unique loot needs to ideally create and affect gameplay, like grappling hook parts or jump boots from the Breeze. Maybe a wind staff? It's better than boring potatoes and glow berries.</p>",

But an arthropod boss on the chambers (like a crab) will instantly make this update better, creating exciting content for multiplayer &amp; youtube videos.

What about iron-armored zombies using shields? This'll make piercing crossbows finally useful! Difficulty should affect game mechanics &amp; not just mob damage, like how Wardens in hard should spawn with only 2-3 shrieks, I never see them.</p>\n\n<p>I love the varying heights &amp; copper grate parkour of the chambers, though these vanilla structures are often dull &amp; ugly. Take inspiration from builders! If possible, increase the dungeon size, add foliage, cobwebs, water on the chambers to beautify it. I think the trial spawners need to be unbreakable, as multiplayer trolls can destroy these valuable blocks.</p>\n\n<p>In the future, they could add a late-game trial chamber in the nether/end, like a colosseum structure.

I'd have some demarkared \"hard\" rooms that can generate where the spawner spawns a singular (or 2 maybe 3 when playing with more players) beefed up mob, like say a Zombie with full diamond armour with light enchants and a strong weapon that when killed leaves better rewards from its Trial spawner.</p>\n\n<p>3. I'm sure there's more to come (as I've yet to see any pitfall traps) but I'd love to see more traps. Like tripwire triggered ones, pressure plates under lingering potion dispensers of varying types or hidden dripstone droppers etc., lava/powdered snow buckets and not just water ones in dispensers</p>\n\n<p>4. I'd have the possibility to get rooms that are waterlogged with drowned spawners and pufferfish etc. to add some variety.</p>\n\n<p>5.

Though, the bigger rooms with multiple spawners should be the common ones, so I can bring my wolves to a straight fight. There should be stairs to access those rooms with multiple floors, so I don't have to tower up. Enemies need equipment, I'd like to see the terror of baby zombies with swords. Add the rare enemies as well like spider jockeys and endermites. I like the lingering potion traps actually, make them more common as the breeze can be more interesting with it. A strength AOE can benefit both allies and enemies, making the fight more dangerous. Weaken and turtle master does the opposite, slowing the battle. Leaping and swiftness AOE can allow fast paced fights. A boss fight room with breezes and these traps will be fun.</p>",

With different types of entrance, somtimes just a door, a vault type like there is in the trials, sometimes a lantern before just a basic tunnel with the room in the back, etc&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having an entrance to the trials in some other builds would be really cool too, like from a temple, igloo, mension etc !</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Voila, loving what have been revealed so far, have fun on the rest of it !&nbsp;</p>",

Add larger battle rooms with more spawners, allowing the breeze to jump better. This trials idea is one of mojang's best idea yet and should be reused on other dimensions, for harder battle options.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The copper structure and rooms look good but needs a prominent imposing entrance from a cave, perhaps with torches or those copper lights on the entrance, rather than having to dig in through bricks. The chamber itself could've been buried within caves.</li>\n<li>The loot from the spawner blocks are bad. Adding a rare diamond reward can be nice, it's not an OP farm since you have to wait. The husks, silverfishes, they can have drops like dead bush or tuff. The trials are a nice opportunity to make items renewable, or introduce unknown items to players.</li>\n<li>The poison tipped skeletons are awesome but they tend to fight each other. Perhaps create a mossy variant that doesn't care about friendly fires? It's a good idea to give some enemies enchanted weapons and shields.</li>\n<li>Others have said it before, but the key should lead to a boss room that everyone can fight repeatedly. Something that deals less damage than the dragon and wither, but high health, as an early boss to encounter.</li>\n</ol>",

There's nice platforms to jump around on the powder snow room, and copper grate windows to see neighboring rooms. Whoever designed the trial chambers need a raise, and I'm kind of hoping strongholds and pyramids get updated someday. This is a great combat minigame and activity for servers, big sprawling structures like this add playtime hours. The only design problem I see is the amount of gray colors here that are too common in minecraft caves and structures. Some of the gray tuff blocks look good, as they look like aztec wind temples, but they should add more copper for a steampunk theme or try other unique colors in future structures. Some rooms also got destroyed with bedrock blocks, making it ugly. Since the trial chambers are a bit hard to find, players entering them are using diamonds already, so the combat is a little easy with one player and much easier with 4 players. The idea of an arthropod boss sounds good, a spider queen can improve minecraft lore and explain where all these spiders are coming from. Copper bulbs are satisfying to scrape, and I like how we don't need to use torches, but add advancements for this so players know how to do these chambers.</p>",

There should also be drowned spawners, and there should be a melee option that would have regular prismarine around the spawner and a ranged option meaning that only drowned with tridents spawn, and those spawners can be marked with dark prismarine.

        "body": "<p>I've tested the difficulty significantly, it varies but it's generally easy. Diamond is mostly the player's gear on average before finding a chamber, which takes time. Skeletons only need a shield and they'll kill each other. Silverfish and zombies are too weak, they need gear and upgrades. Baby zombies are easy if you tower up, though if there's breeze and skeletons it'll prevent this, so the big rooms with varied enemy types are the most fun.</p>\n\n<p>But enchants made the chambers too easy. Sharp 5, full Prot 4, and you can plow everything, even if there's iron golem enemies. And all you need to do to become a god is early-game tedious fishing and villagers. I can see why they're nerfing villagers, but they went about it the wrong way.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I'd increase the enchantments obtainable in survival to Sharp 10 and Prot 8, but halve their power so Prot 8 is the new Prot 4. This mitigates player backlash. Enchant tables, villagers, fishing etc will go up to Sharp 5 as usual. But if we put a nether ruby or enderite instead of lapis lazuli, the tables can go to higher tiers. Fishing in nether lava and End dimension can also yield the higher books. Remove the anvil's enchant upgrading (like prot1 + prot1 = prot2) and \"too expensive\" feature, so players can keep updating their gear with new books. Structures like mansions/bastions have better books, making them valuable. This creates better progression that encourages gameplay, with tough End trial chambers giving the best enchants.</p>",

I start with a diamond sword, iron armour, iron tools, a shield, scaffolding, torches, a stack of porkchops, and about 4 regular golden apples. My takeaways are:</p>\n<p>1. I like how you can enter rooms from different angles, so even if you enter the same room preset twice it feels different. The layout also makes it easy to go methodically from room to room, so I don't feel like I've missed something when I'm done. My favourite discovery is that when poison Skeletons freeze in the snow room, they become Strays with poison <em>and</em> slowness — scary! More gimmick rooms like this would be fun. I like the secret room at the beginning, and I think adding more secret rooms to the Chambers would be fun.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Using the same four mobs within an individual Chamber can make it feel repetitive. Breezes do add variety, but I think this is undermined by the fact that they're in every Chamber, so you're expecting them every time. More mob variety between each room would be good.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Chambers can look very out of place when they cut into caves, especially when you get that boxy terrain generating around them (like when a village goes over water).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. Glow berries + potatoes from Trial Spawners feels underwhelming. Standard golden apples are really valuable in chambers, especially when faced with a room full of Skeletons. Maybe Spawners could award these instead?</p>",

Many years ago, we can hold-tap to craft stacks quickly. This is fine.

Button bugs persist, like how if I tap a button with 2 fingers (common with big thumbs), I'll end up accidentally placing a block etc. I shouldn't be able to tap + look around if my touch starts in the button AOE.

We died a bunch (and cheated our way back, but THANK YOU to the people who decided to have the bed room - that would have been super helpful if we had been doing this in a proper survival world). The rooms are so well designed with all of the dispensers for potions, water, etc. It got quite hectic in the rooms with poison skeletons. The only thing that let it down a little bit was the AI of the mobs. There was a cave spider that went out into the next room over and climbed into the top corner, so it took us a while to find it which was a little annoying. Also, for some reason, breezes kept staying up on their spawning platforms, and as soon as I towered up to it (which wasn’t easy with the skeletons) it would drop down. This wasn’t a one off occurrence, it happened like 2 or 3 times. That’s a small thing, but a tiny bit frustrating. With loot, it felt really cool smashing the pots to uncover resources. It felt SO much cooler finding diamonds in a pot in a corridor than in a chest. It just feels so good, like you’ve just uncovered a secret stash of resources. The only loot-related criticism I have is that the trial keys were cool to find the first time, but they got pretty dull after the literal 26th trial key we got. It depends what the keys are going to be used for, but they feel too common. All in all, I love this structure. It’s a really cool addition to the game.</p>",

I don't believe having this be more mid-game would be a good idea, as any mid-game items that would be rewarded in the chambers can be easily and quickly replaced by better equipment. But having it be more late-game would make most of the rewards obsolete as well, since the player would most likely have much better gear. I truly am torn as to how this could work out in a logical sense of Minecrafts progression, as the fights themselves are fairly difficult for someone in full iron, but is swept easily by someone in full diamond. I suppose there needs to be a middle ground of progression where the trial chambers can fit, not only to provide something difficult for players to tackle, but also not too difficult as to discourage players from exploring them. Whatever that middle ground is, I'm sure it doesn't involve Glowberries as a suitable reward lol</p>",

I was overwhelmed by skeletons twice, the first time they pushed me into the pool of water surrounding the underwater bedroom and I got stuck because I had no idea where they were. Some were able to fire at me too. There also wasn’t anywhere for me to leave the pool so I had to carefully place blocks without risking being shot at. I think there should be less skeletons spawning for single players and skeleton spawners should not be too close to the under water bedroom. Yes I was able to kill all the mobs from almost every Trial Spawner while wearing Iron Armour but I did enchant my Bow with Infinity. If I hadn’t, I would have had to leave and come back many times because the bow is the most useful weapon for Trial Chambers and a stack of 64 arrows plus a few more, the amount I would carry, probably isn’t enough especially if you are struggling to kill any skeletons. The Breeze definitely needs its own drop and stray trial spawners should spawn less strays than skeleton trial spawners spawn skeletons. I don’t like having to tower up to get to some places as well. I like having to do parkour but I think everywhere needs to be accessible without using blocks. Also, an over ground indication of the trial chambers is needed or then players will be wasting their time, digging around. Also, this addition has not changed anything because there are better ways to get good loot</p>",

And with how rare the heavy core is, players won't find the mace either, unless they explore thousands of blocks farming lots of chambers.</p>\n\n<p>I think some of the devs are a bit too obsessed with rarity. It can be really fun to get rare item drops! But key features of updates should not be rare, so updates don't feel like \"the nothing update\". I think if the devs want rarity, they can make an axolotl color rare for example, something that isn't too important to the update. Or alternatively, make more \"important\" update content, for example having two weapon additions in an update, one common and one rare. The most important thing though, if players can reset chunks or grind worlds like Minecraft Dungeons games, it'll make grinding for rares much more manageable! Exploring thousands of blocks every new update bloats the game files too much, and I need to save chunks for future updates.</p>",

In Bedrock community, we have this trend of \"skipping\" updates, not exploring/playing the game to save chunks for future updates. Console/mobile simply can't handle 5-10GB saves as they'll corrupt, so please don't force players to explore. I'm glad I skipped playing 1.20 as trims require exploring large chunks, but I fear I'd have to skip 1.21 as well, unless I cheat the mace in somehow. I don't mind maces being rare but I just wish the vaults/mace are farmable to make keys useful, I had hoped the chambers are a repeatable activity.

On hard difficulty try adding zombie with swords, and helpful potion effects for these spawning mobs. The \"spawners now increase the amount of mobs present at once by 0.5 for each additional player, down from 2\" change makes multiplayer trial chamber insignificant. Most multiplayer sessions are only with 2 players, and having a 0.5 mob increase doesn't make a difference. I'd revert it to 1 at least!</p>\n<p>For Weaving and Infested potions: I really love that cobweb's renewable now. But Weaving often fails to spawn cobweb, and it should spawn at least 2 webs to make an impact in trial combat. Infested potion doesn't make any difference in trial combat as the 5% spawn chance almost never happens. I'd increase it to 7% at least.</p>\n<p>The ominous bottle drop-chance on spawners is too low, I'd increase it just a bit so new players can actually find and use it in the chambers. Ominous trials need advancements!</p>\n<p>Breach enchant needs to be capped at level III instead of IV. After testing, we find it to be too strong on PvP, and it makes armor and sword/axe useless. Breach III is good enough.</p>\n<p>I really love the Wind Burst enchant, mace feels satisfying now and players are already making video content with it, like parkour maps and combo-ing enemies!

        "body": "<p>Just went into a trial chamber for the first time, without any prior knowledge, here's my feedback:</p>\n<p>- At first sight, it's difficult to realize what's happening or what this structure is. Sure, you explore for a while and monsters start appearing and you kill them and that's that. I think <strong>the structure lacks some more ambient</strong>, mainly unique music and sounds would probably help.</p>\n<p>- It would be VERY useful to have a sort of <strong>\"boss bar\", for each wave of monsters, kind of like the raid bars</strong> that tell you how many raid enemies remain. This would help both to create ambient, since the game would clearly alert you that something important is happening, and also for quality of life, since it did happen to me a few times that a single enemy was remaining but I couldn't find it because it fell down to some corner.</p>\n<p>- It seems like you end up with more keys than vaults there are, and this feels very weird, I was wondering if there were some vaults hidden somewhere that I missed, but no. Why keep giving keys if you already opened all the vaults?</p>\n<p>- <strong>The ominous vaults are very unclear</strong>. You see them there, they are clearly something important, but you go to them and they don't do anything. There's nothing in the game that incites you to try to use an ominous bottle in a trial chamber or that relates that bottle to those vaults, so I had to look it on the wiki.</p>\n<p>(follow on next post due to character limit)</p>",

Emeralds, iron, low-level enchantments, etc. are mostly useless in mid-game since they are very easily obtained.</p>\n<p>- The chambers lack connection to the in-game \"lore\". I know Minecraft doesn't really have a lore, but the chambers feel very disconnected from the rest of the game, like the sort of structure that a mod would add. I think this was a missed opportunity to implement some mechanics from the chambers onto other older structures which have practically no use, like jungle temples. Another thing that I think would help greatly would be to <strong>have signs of this civilization that supposedly built these chambers on the surface</strong>, as some sort of ruins. These could even indicate the presence of chambers nearby so you wouldn't have to rely only on explorer maps and luck.</p>",

Perhaps with april fools and dimensions like the nether, developers don't have to worry as much about \"ruining the overworld experience\", and so they can take more risks to add fun, challenging content. I wish for new deep dark, end or sky dimensions, <strong>epic adventures are essential for content creators.</strong> We can have hellish warden dimensions, an optional extreme challenge where many wardens exist naturally without shriek.

Your character can’t take cover and since there’s no way to move the character’s head independent of the body. Having spawners scattered on many different levels, spawning multiple types of mobs with multiple attacks. Successfully getting through the higher chambers beyond the submerged rest area is next to impossible when being swarmed from all sides. The close quarters layout of the chambers and spawner placement detracts from completing the objectives. At the same time, make any attempt at appreciating any design elements of the chambers impossible. </p>",

Isn't enough in the tricky aspect. So here are my suggestions.</p>\n<p>First. make new chambers that has moving walls. In various different walkways. And have pillars that go up and down, and you have to time it right to get to the pillar next without falling on various levels of dripstone, in order to get to a platform that has a spawner, or various, (could even be an encounter) but you have to be careful cause the wall will move of trying to push you into the dripstone.</p>\n<p>My next suggestion is in the giant hallways, make a contraption. And add vertical tripwire. So that arrows can be shot down at the player as well.</p>\n<p>Next. Make chambers full of water, with drowned ( and guardian ?) spawners so that you have to battle for air by going to magma blocks of soul sand, while still having to fight with the mobs, and finally Make a chamber&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And finally make the entrance a couple of new entrance schematics, that actually lead out into the caves, but have a grander entrance.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank You for your time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sincerely.</p>\n<p>DragonWrangler</p>",
