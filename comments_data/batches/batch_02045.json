Below you will find a transcription of the topic being discussed. <br><br>Title: “Have a friend” <br><br>Text: “It would be nice if in singleplayer we could have an NPC friend in survival, it could be a Steve or an Alex, since, even if Villager is a human, he doesn't have that much interaction with the player. This friend he could explore, hunt and exchange with the player, entertaining and amusing him. And of course: he could be reborn at the player's spawn point. He could find himself wandering around the world, or spawning with the player, or he could heal an ordinary zombie, as he has some human characteristics like his shirt and size. This would make the game much more interesting.”</p>\n<p>- Translated by Admin</p>",

Imma post it here instead &lt;3</p>\n\n<p>The WPT (Wandering Piglin Trader) will sell nether related items, but it doesn’t want to trade emeralds or gold for its items. The WPT wants overworld items that are the opposite or sort of correspond with its own items, for example: blaze rods for packed ice, nylium for grass blocks, warped stems for oak logs, ghast tears for spider eyes, gold nuggets for iron nuggets etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>The game attempts to spawn a WPT every 48000 ticks (40 min) with a 10% chance to succeed (the chance will increase every time it fails). There’ll only spawn a WPT if there isn’t one already in the loaded chunks and if there is spaces of lava nearby that are two blocks tall with three blocks of air above them. It’ll despawn after 24000 ticks no matter what.</p>\n\n<p>If the player doesn’t wear any gold armor at all the WPT will try to flee from the player and won’t trade with the player. So, the player must wear at least one piece of gold armor to trade with the WPT. The WPT will also flee from Hoglins. If the WPT is killed it’ll drop the warped fungus on a stick that it was holding. If the strider is killed, you’re not only a monster :), but the WPT will run or walk on ground like any other piglin if it isn’t dropped into lava of course. </p>\n\n<p>If the WPT is implemented into the game it’ll allow peaceful players to acquire ghast tears and blaze rods thus being able to complete the game</p>",

They don't even know YOU or what you ARE. They're natives of the Nether. Not you. They are used to Endermen and magma cubes. Not you. They have adapted to their lives there and the many challenges it comes with. </p>\n\n<p>They know all they have to do to avoid an Endermen's wrath is to not look into their eyes. They know to kill Wither Skeletons and magma cubes because of the danger/items they get. But you? You're NEW. And think about how humans, as a society, reacts to the different and unknown. We shouldn't hold the Piglins to a higher standard. So they have every right to attack us, but I would like the more you come around the more they try to scope you out. Like maybe you have to move slowly so you don't spook them into attacking you? And maybe the more you trade with them the better/more diverse they get?? Like they share the secrets of \"soul sand walking\" and other Nether related enchantment with you?</p>\n\n<p>Another thing I would like also like is for them to actually have little dirty huts, not just the bastion, and maybe little scouting parties to patrol for food/threats to their people. They would try to smack you away/push you back from their village/bastion. As they don't trust you yet, and they would have to get used to you before they allowed you in. Even with a full golden armor set. Now THAT would be great gameplay. </p>",
