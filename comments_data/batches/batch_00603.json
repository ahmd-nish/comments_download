If you add (right-click) ingredients such as potatoes, carrots, mushrooms, beet root, fish, rabbit, chicken, etc. the contents change to a stew, which you can then fill bowls with. As soon as you put in at least one brown mushroom, one red mushroom, and one or more flowers, the entire contents of the pot turn into suspicious stew until the pot has been emptied. This should be a way to combine stew effects by adding multiple flowers, for example a stew that grants fire resistance, regeneration and saturation, making it a worthwhile game mechanic.

        "body": "<p>Clay pots as buckets: Fired pots should be useable as a water container when held in the hand. Right clicking normally should scoop up or place water, just like a bucket. Actually placing the clay pot as a block should be done by crouching while right-clicking. This would facilitate stone-age water management, enabling players to irrigate their farms without having to mess with metallurgy (finding iron and making a bucket) first, but wouldn't devalue the bucket because clay pots are harder to craft (requiring an extra firing step), will presumably be unstackable, and could be unable to contain lava.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Clay pots as plant pots: Another popular use for pots in real life. Adding dirt to a clay pot, either through a crafting recipe, or by right-clicking with dirt in hand, should result in a plant pot. Like the flower pot, you should be able to place any flower or other small plant in clay pots, but it should display a bigger version of the plant than the flower pot, or multiple, like candles. Unlike the flower pot, this should enable the growing of some food crops: potatoes, carrots, beetroot, berries, maybe mushrooms. Would be a fun, visually pleasing way to realize indoor farms. Could have the benefit of being usable as fully productive farmland without having to place a water source nearby. Could even be made more productive than irrigated farmland, rewarding clay and effort invested with faster growing crops, adding a bit of sorely needed dimension to farming as a game mechanic.</p>",

For example an ominous face mold could be found in either the deep dark chests or woodland mansions, a strange face mold could be found in the nether or the end), and one or two normal variant face molds could be found/made with normal overworld chests.
