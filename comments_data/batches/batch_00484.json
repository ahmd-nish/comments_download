(Remember that blocks that are part of the 16 color system are all dyeable blocks. Trees are not.)</p>",

Pictures online suggest that's where they reside.</p>\n<p>And overwhelming the game with too many options that duplicate each other would be a bit much.&nbsp; If we have a Dark Brown plank (Spruce) and an even darker Dark Brown plank (Dark Oak).&nbsp; Then we might not need yet another Dark Brown plank.</p>\n<p>I think a red-tinted wood plank is a wonderful idea and would create an opportunity to introduce a new biome (Cherry-Blossom Biome perhaps?&nbsp; Certain species of Cherry are red tinted).&nbsp; The additional colors of Pink and Magenta would be stunning as well.</p>\n<p>All in all a great idea though.&nbsp; I didn't know there is a Magenta tinted wood!&nbsp; I looked it up and was amazed.&nbsp; That would be a very wacky block in Minecraft!</p>",

Everything except the easel is in the game already, and with the addition of archeology, I think the game is moving in a direction that this would fit.</p>\n\n<p>It would be the most popular addition to the game hands down, period. Minecraft is about being creative after all.</p>\n\n<p>To add to this, I would like to see the painting be able to be placed in an item frame, especially an invisible one, like how mapart can. This will allow us to basically make block textures on the fly that are flush with the block face.</p>\n\n<p>This will basically almost solve people begging for vertical slabs too, as well as asking for certain variants of blocks.</p>",

The leaves, flowers and fruit of potato plants all contain that same substance as well, and any regular potato planted in the ground for growing will eventually turn poisonous as it produces solanine and starts sprouting. So this is not \"spoiled\" as in decaying, or infested or diseased, it is simply how the potato plant works normally. So there is really nothing special or evil or whatever about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As such, in addition to being compostable, poisonous potatoes should also be plantable, starting in growth stage 1 instead of 0 for regular potatoes, since that is exactly what they are: Regular potatoes that simply already started growing before being planted, making them inedible for humans, but faster to grow further, and growing into perfectly normal, regular potato plants, eventually yielding a harvest of regular potatoes.&nbsp;</p>",

Firstly, I think keys should be crafted in a 2x2 grid like so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nugget = #<br>Nothing = +<br>+&nbsp; #<br>#&nbsp; +</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Simple, right? The tradeoff with this recipe being that you must rename the key at an anvil in order to make the lock unique, that means the default item name would work somewhat like a skeleton key.</p>\n<p>I imagine that shift clicking a block / door would somehow place a padlock onto that block while only allowing that block to be 'used' or it's lock to be 'broken' if that player is holding the correct key in their dominant hand.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my other unsorted ideas and questions, please feel free to share your ideas;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Locked intractable blocks should deny access or do not function. <em>(Furnace, Piston, doors, etc.)</em>\n</li>\n<li>Locking or unlocking blocks should update that block. <em>(Hidden switches, anyone?)</em>\n</li>\n<li>Dispensers could use keys to lock / unlock the tile in front of it when powered.</li>\n<li>I don't know if this is an issue but I imagine an unlimited amount of locks may cause poor performance, should the maximum amount of locks be regulated by gamerules and player data or 3-6 locks per key?</li>\n<li>Different types of keys not only look cool but may be possible and may have an alternative use. <em>(Iron and gold keys.)</em>\n</li>\n<li>Should the break speed of a locked block be slower due to the added protection?</li>\n</ul>",

Over time, the chain would begin to crack or change in appearance. One weak link could cause the entire chain to collapse like scaffolding. Old/damaged chain could be smelted for an iron ingot.

Similar to how diamond is used to craft a jukebox, they should serve as a required part for some interactive blocks that may come up for use (such as the huge set of new tables coming in 1.14). For example, let's say you could throw in an emerald in the middle of a circle of stone bricks and that'd be your blast furnace, instead of measly iron that allows you to craft it almost instantly. They could also be used to form \"higher-tier\" redstone components (Quartz already serves its job in this department). For example, using lapis or emerald in some components could make a two-input computational gate of some sort. Or maybe a piston with new physics.</p>",

But I think it could he an interesting concept if you could combine gold into a pre-existing tool like a shovel, axe or pickaxe to give it some new properties.

These alloys could be use in decoration, or have specific uses.</p>\n<p>Example :</p>\n<p>- Blue gold is an alloy of Gold and Iron (an existing alloy) that is made of 75% of gold and 25% of iron. This alloy could be use to craft a blue gold block, that can be used in decoration, and blue gold nuggets. The blue gold can be used to craft armors and tools, that have the same durability and protection than normal gold armors (and which can be smelted in blue gold nuggets). Rarely, mobs can naturally spawn with a blue gold armor. Some pigmen can have a blue gold sword. When a mob is equipped of blue gold armor/tool, it gains a random effect (among speed, slowness, strength, jump boost, nausea, resistance, fire resistance, invisibility, blindness, weakness, health boost, glowing, levitation, slow falling), and if equipped with 4 pieces of blue armor this random effect is lvl 2. When the player is equipped of a blue gold armor/tool, it also gains a random effect (lvl 2 if fully equipped), that is different every 2 minutes. Even if the armor doesn't protect it very well (as it protects similar to the gold armor) it should be fun to wear it.<br>The blue gold ore can also be used to craft a special brewing stand, that use blue gold as fuel, and produces a random potion when used (therefore potions would be craftable by peaceful players)</p>",

Make Gold and Iron ingots placeable, as this would be great decoration for a loot vault or something similar.<br>They could work like the turtle eggs, and what I mean by that is when you place the ingot you only start with one ingot in a 1x1 block space, and you can add more ingots to the 1x1 block space, until around 4-5 blocks are stacked. (Like in this image) This could extend to emeralds and diamonds to some degree also, but I image it would be much harder.<br><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/DtjG1CpG4hRq5YLZIMZwjg.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>2.Give Emeralds more use or make them easier to find. I am not saying to add emerald armor/tools, but I just want emeralds to have more uses than trading. Emeralds are more rare than diamonds (I'm pretty sure, at least) but only are used to trade with villagers and as beacon fuel. Ideas I have personally are for emeralds are:<br>A light amplifier: Placing an emerald block under/near a light source could double its light value or something like that.<br>A new debuff potion: Potion of FAST falling, just a simple idea that could be lots of fun in PvP.<br>There is tons of other things you can do with emeralds, these are just some ideas I had.</p>\n<p>3. New building blocks using minerals. I know TONS of really good looking stairs and slabs are getting added in 1.14, but I have a few more ideas. Basically stairs (and maybe slabs) made out of&nbsp;Gold, Diamond, Lapis, Emerald, and Obsidian. Obsidian is personally one of my FAVORITE blocks to build with as it is my favorite color (Purple) and is hard to destroy. With the blast furnace being added though, I have a cool idea for a new block that I would absolutely ADORE. Smooth Obsidian would be only mineable with a diamond pickaxe like Obsidian, although much faster. I think they would look like regular obsidian but smoothed out, and with a lighted purple hue. For reference, I think they would look similar to the granite blocks from Terraria, but with a dark purple hue. I imagine these blocks would be created by placing regular obsidian inside of a blast furnace, and using Lava as the fuel, would create smooth obsidian blocks.</p>\n<p>(Image of Granite Blocks from Terraria for reference)<br><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/kKr4ZPvc4Hjh0rUZuSxaXg.png\">)</p>",

It's a small addition and will most likely go unnoticed by players who had no idea of the feature if it was to be added. However, a way I think this can be made more cool is when the block is about to be struck, the ambience around the block has a low 'humming' sound which gets louder before lightning strikes. <br><br>This can (possibly) be applied to iron, chainmail and gold armour as well, making it dangerous to wear metal armour in the open when a thunderstorm is taking place. (However, this idea can be debated since rain and thunder is commonly disliked). BUT! Gold armour will have a special ability if it gets struck by lightning. In Minecraft \"\"\"lore\"\"\" gold has always had special 'magic' and 'healing' properties (such as gold foods being able to heal and have more saturation and tend to get better enchantments). Upon getting struck, the player wearing gold armour gets speed, haste and possibly strength for a few seconds. This will give an armour that never gets worn in normal survival and actual tempting use during specific occasions. It will also tempt players to vary their armour if they haven't discovered diamonds yet to change to gold or leather since iron and chainmail will be dangerous to wear.<br><br>I do feel like this may be too much of a drastic change regarding armour, so one idea is to simply make lighting only strike gold armour and leave chainmail and iron out of the whole 'electricity conducting'.<br><br>Nonetheless, I hope these ideas gave you inspiration because I doubt these ideas will be implemented as their complete raw original concept, since a lot can be polished with these ideas.</p>",

When a banner is applied the border of the shield would show the color of the chosen reinforcing ore.\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Iron reinforced shield</strong> – Created by surround a shield with iron ingots. This would have the blocking ability to the way shields currently are. Although it makes them more expensive. This would make the strength of the shield more understandable.<img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/6KlHXbufTd-5on8fHPiItQ.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Diamond reinforced shield</strong> – Created by surround a shield with diamonds. In addition to making the shield stronger with would give the shield the power to deflect the projectiles back at the attacker.<img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/44l8uDPoSG0RzYQq2OuBWg.png\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Gold reinforced shield</strong> – Created by surround a shield with gold ingots.

        "body": "<p>most of my suggestions for this particular post are going to center largely around minecrafts most unused ore(i think its an ore?): Flint.</p>\n<p>One of the most annoying things about minecraft is the ridiculous amount of flint you get, and the fact that it's pretty much useless. You get a massive amount of arrows from skeletons, so you don't need it for that, You only need 1-2 flint-and-steel, so you don't use much for that either. (the day i say i need more flint i will probably be in the middle of a seizure and forgot what it was) It would be nice if there was some more use for it so that i'm not constantly throwing it away.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(Crafting #1) Flint + End rod = <strong>Dark end rod</strong> - this is simple, i love building things in minecraft and i think the end rod was one of the best additions, as it opened up a lot of things (using them upside down to make table legs, putting them on walls to make it look like a lamp is hanging from them, and more) but they only come in 1 color, adding a dark version of them would be great.&nbsp;<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>(Crafting #2) 4 flint = <strong>stone path</strong> - i thought of this because i love the medievil feel that minecraft has, and having some king of flat lily-pad like stone to put on top of other blocks (like grass) that looks like disconected flat rocks would work well with the ' in the wild' feel, it could also have a brick version, as well as&nbsp;<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>(Crafting #3) 9 flint = <strong>flint block</strong> (i bet you thought i was going to say gravel, huh?) this was actually something i thought of both as a building block (again, another path, another bottom for aquariums), and as another sound thing after the the most recent <strong>note-block update</strong>. if it was made so that when the note block was set on top of the flint block it would play one of the normal 'player walking on' sounds or 'block breaking' sounds, it would be really interesting for both adventure-maps, and servers (yes, i know you can-command-block it on adventure maps, but come-on, give us red-stoning-lazy people something&nbsp; =D (Translation: i can never remember commands lol))<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>(Crafting #4) flint + iron-bars =<strong>&nbsp;Spiked iron bar tops</strong> (The spikes on the top of iron fences in real life) again, i'm a huge fan of minecraft's medieval style, and a lot of really old-rustic buildings tend to have iron bar-fence fences with those spikes on them, also if they were a half block high, then putting them on top of the iron-bars would turn them into realistic fences that were to high but still kept mobs out(added bonus - if t hey acted like thy magma when a mob walked over them, IE: hurting the mob, that would also make them work like traps for the mini-games, and for people who make adventure maps, so it's a 3-way win (and mob farms, make that 4)<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>(Crafting #5) Flint + leather boots = <strong>spiked boots</strong> - these boot stop you from slipping on grass and have a small chance to turn grass you are walking on into grass path, because really, just try making a trodden path that looks random. i dare ya, see what happens. i look the 'random grass path blocks ' look for warn paths, but i am not good at making them look randomized. this would help a bunch.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>(Crafting #6) flint + pumpkin = <strong>different jack 'o lanterns</strong> - (pumpkin in the center of the crafting table and where the single flint is around it determines what face you get) again, variations, jack o' lanter faces (like creeper face, skull, so on so-forth) 8-spots = 8 different jack o' lanterns.<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>(Crafting #7) flint + glass = <strong>cracked glass</strong> - i tend to build in both the roofed forest and the swamps (i know, i'm strange, everyone else hate building in the swamp biome, i love them) and i love making my bases look like creepy old haunted houses. having cracked glass would help add to that, also, having cracked glass would make adventure maps and traps more fun if the cracked glass broke when you walk or run on it (IE you have to sneak or else)<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>(Crafting #8) Flint + Potato = <strong>Spiked potato</strong>, it&nbsp;could then be brewed to make <strong>potion of rough-skin</strong>&nbsp;(Thorn enchantment as a potion effect) Also, piggy-backing off of <a href=\"/hc/en-us/profiles/366131494412-Unbiunium\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Unbiunium&nbsp;</a>, if <strong>iron potato</strong> was a thing as well, then<strong> iron potato</strong> + flint could make an iron spiked potato, which could brew <strong>potion of rough-skin II&nbsp;</strong>Maybe you could even throw spiked potato/iron potato/Iron spiked potato like a snowball)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I know these aren't that inventive, but it's flint, it's hard to come up with stuff for that particular resource, hence when it's one of the most unused in the game, but i have other stuff to suggest for the other ores, and a lot of THOSE and they are way way better, as they are way easier, but i'll post those in a different post</p>",

Each time an affected block aligns with the world grid, it should accept a redstone update and check for block collisions.</p>\n\n<p>Mobs and items should be moved by affected blocks, even while on top. Use them to create elevators, floating bridges or crushers.</p>\n\n<p>** Blower **\n<br />As electromagnets can be used to create brushless motors, redstone magnets can be used to create blowers. Each time it is triggered by redstone a fan on the front face will rotate 180°. This creates a force that pushes mobs and items forwards for 2 ticks. This effect stacks, so triggering it faster or using multiple blowers pushes harder. Placing against a furnace, this effect will speed up processing and fuel consumption.</p>\n\n<p>~~~ Gold Electrical Conductor ~~~\n<br />Gold should be used to conduct redstone.</p>\n\n<p>** Redstone Rod ** \n<br />It is made from 2 gold nuggets and a Redstone dust. Like an end rod it can be placed in any direction. It can transmit redstone to any block that it is actually touching. It can only transmit to other rods end to end so it is insulated from other lines but can only travel in one direction. It should have a 1 tick delay because light shows are pretty. This should work underwater and have some blast resistance.</p>\n\n<p>~~~ World Generation ~~~\n<br />Generally I would like different areas to have ore veins in different quantities. So if you wanted lots of one thing you would explore the overworld to find it.</p>\n\n<p>*** Abandoned Mineshaft Rich in Random Ore ***\n<br />When generated, abandoned mineshafts should select a random ore type and increase their occurrence in a cube region around them. The selected ore could have 50% more veins by overriding other veins or creating new ones in the stone. The Mineshaft could select a secondary ore type as well and increase their occurrence by 25%. Whatever the selected ore is, it should generate around the mineshaft regardless of y level. It would be nice if these mineshafts could generate entrances on the surface more often and have cave-ins or just mounds of gravel preventing passage.</p>\n\n<p>~~ Alloys ~~~\n<br />Alloys use different percentages of metals to create different qualities. </p>\n\n<p>** Crucible ** \n<br />Generally they use a crucible to mix alloys. It could accept 2 stacks of metals and create a different alloy depending on the percentage difference between them.</p>\n\n<p>** Steel **\n<br />It is made of iron and less than 2% carbon (coal) It is one of the strongest materials on the planet. Could be a tier between iron and diamond. Could be used for highly blast resistant blocks and industrial machines.</p>\n\n<p>** Gold/Iron Alloy **\n<br />Gold and iron don't alloy IRL but if they could it would be magical. This could be a tier between iron and gold. Highly enchantmentable, also durable. Could be used for advanced redstone components as well being both magnetic and conductive.</p>\n\n<p>~~~ Crystals as Abrasive ~~~\n<br />Crystals like quartz are used as Abrasive for sculpting rock. </p>\n\n<p>*** Stone Grinder ***\n<br />Used to break stone into gravel and gravel into sand. Also used to get gems out of ore, bonemeal from bone etc. It takes netherquartz as a fuel source and/or is activated by redstone and uses netherquartz in the crafting recipe.</p>\n\n<p>~~~ Miscellaneous ~~~\n<br />*** Thieving Enchantment I - III ***\n<br />Chance to drop iron or gold nugget when attacking.</p>\n\n<p>** Crystal Detection **\n<br />A passive or tamable mob or an offhand item that makes a noise when close or points to the nearest lapis, emerald, diamond or netherquartz ore would be nice.</p>\n\n<p>** More Uses for Nuggets **\n<br />Like redstone rod...</p>\n\n<p>** An Ore in The End **\n<br />I like amethyst or onyx. I could list another 10 magical teleporty, nighttime and gravity themed ideas for those but that would be breaking the rules, so ignore this...</p>\n\n<p>Hope you take these on board (except ender onyx which we can talk about later.)</p>",

Steel tools would work the same but last longer than iron but not as long as diamond would and does maybe one point or half damage more than iron equipment, texture could be the same as the rest but a grayish color. \n<br />All ores have a more specific biome they stay in the largest quantities but can still be in other biomes just not as big of a vein. Using a block of an ore to create a tool such mainly shovel, pickaxe,sword,hoe, and axe will be a different item thatbis stronger than their counterparts. Sword would be like a longsword and have a better damage attack and have a Area of Attack like the axe, the axe could chop wood faster, the shovel can dig faster and looks bigger than the regular shovel, the pickaxe can harvest more ores that it mines such as coal drops twice as much as usual, and hoes can instantly fertilize ground if a plant is on it. Each one could do more damage to make them more useful. These are my ideas and i hope i have at least inspired some sort of an idea for you</p>",

It would be made with 3 cactus and 3 iron ingots. It does 2 damage to the player if they step on it. It can be tipped with lingering potions. Just like with arrows and gives whatever potion effect it has on it when stepped on. If you put it on a fence or gate it would harm you with same amount of damage that it did as a normal spike.</p>\n<p>My other idea is to have it be used to make iron reinforced oak doors, acacia doors, dark oak door, etc. These doors are just like iron doors except they are openable and actually look better then iron doors.

Trained compasses would provide a limited means of navigation in the Nether and the End, useful for everybody but especially players who choose not to use coordinates.</p>\n<p>A regular compass could be \"trained\" to point to a specific iron ore block in the Nether, or gold ore block in the End. To train a compass, you would USE it on the ore block. Once trained, the red part of the compass needle would change to the color of the metal to identify it as a trained compass for that dimension. Whenever you're in that dimension, it would point to the ore block. In other dimensions it would spin randomly.</p>\n<p>Like an untrained compass, a trained compass could be carried in the main hand or offhand and would point to its ore as both a held item and an inventory item.</p>\n<p>A trained compass could be retrained to a different ore block of the same kind in the same dimension by USEing it on the new ore block.

They could deal more damage than a sword, and have an area effect whenever swung (similar to java swords but it will constantly have a larger hitbox, and the ability to hit multiple mobs, the damage remaining consistant in the area of the hit but not having as large of a sweep effect) it would however slow you down slightly when held and attack slower than a sword</p>",

It opens up new design possibilities since (besides terracotta) concrete has many different colours to use for builds especially modern or fantasy stuff.

If we are to use our imaginations to create these things the game lacks then they should give us more to work with to do so. Many other blocks have slab, stair and wall options so why not concrete?<br><br>P.s. a colour upgrade to available concrete blocks would also be much appreciated.</p>",
