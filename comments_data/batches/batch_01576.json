Small mobs that don't have a baby status like the allay might have to have an exception for this, though...</p>\n<p>At the very least, 1 cubic meter is a lot of space, and most mobs (an adult villager, for example, takes up only 0.702 cubic meters) are within this margin.

You should add more information about each of the separate new mobs in their own posts, though, because they sound awesome but also need some more specific information about them. Naturally spawning withers would be pretty amazing, but could also mess up the world if they could spawn anywhere and at any time. How about there is a new naturally occurring structure in the Nether that functions similarly to End Gateway Portals, only they take you to sections of the Nether millions of blocks away from the center of the world (which would normally be almost impossible to reach without commands or glitches, making it so that these naturally generated Withers would not destroy and/or corrupt the main area of the Nether you would normal explore in your survival world). These \"Nether Gateway\" portals should be rare and/or require an expensive item to activate them, so they do not cause building your own Wither to become obsolete or inefficient.&nbsp;</p>",
