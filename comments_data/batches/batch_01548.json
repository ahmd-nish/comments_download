        "body": "<p>Here is my idea for a lava loving, gemstone eating, underground dwelling lizard. They were designed as salamanders but could be anything really. Salamanders are amphibeans so it may make more sense for these to be a cold blooded lizard.</p>\n<p>They should spawn near lava&nbsp;pools in the overworld, mostly in caves, lazily basking in the heat it provides. If it feels threatened it may run across the lava to escape. Their diet consists exclusively of gemstones like&nbsp;emerald, lapis lazuli and diamonds. If you feed them one they will follow you for a while. Feeding it a diamond will make it follow you for an hour while lapis lazuli may only be for 3 minutes. The aphrodisiac of choice for the salamander is prismarine crystals.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/Nd6Qz83x110wnJisbLTXyQ.png\"></p>\n<p>Salamanders can detect ores up to 4 blocks away, even through walls. Whenever the salamander is within range of lapis lazuli, emerald, diamond or even nether quartz ore they will run towards it until they get out of range of the player or they hit a wall. When that happens they will return to the player run around in a circle and then run back to the ore.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/WJ9O48AKc-v8wQftZwZQyw.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">When a gem you mine falls to the floor, they may rush to grab it. If you don't get to it first they will steal one and run, possibly across lava pools, to safety. Satisfied with their gem they will stop following you. If you attack the salamander they will drop the gem, if you don't they will eat it with a&nbsp;<em>big gulp</em>.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/3I-GAe5GuGk6vNU_vbnb1w.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">They don't drop loot so there is no reason to kill them. They might get hit once in a while though, so feeding them gems should restore their health.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">In the real world rocks that enter the stomach are called gastroliths. They are swallowed by an animal to assist with digestion of plants, shells and bones. Perhaps salamanders eat silverfish too: a difficult to digest rocky insect.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\"><strong>Justification:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emotional players tend to avoid mining e.g. \"<strong>Sheep are so cute!</strong>&nbsp;<em>Skeletons are so scary...</em>\" This would help those players because it is a shortcut to mining with emotive triggers e.g. \"Oh they're so cute. Good boy, you found some diamond! Is it diamond? Is it diamond? Nooooooo it's lapis,&nbsp;<em><strong>again</strong></em>. Hey that's my diamond! Oh I'm sorry boy, here's some lapis.\"</li>\n<li>The underground has very passive mobs - much less with a unique use.</li>\n</ul>",

Tamed Buffalo Warriors will either Follow the player, Guard a spot, or Patrol an area. The Spear could be introduced as a new weapon for their ranged attack, in some ways similar to a trident but having its uniqueness and being craftable. They could also have a structure called Campsite, where they would not always spawn in; would have campfire and beds and sometimes a chest with loot, this could spawn in plains, forests and mountains.

The idea of repelling them with fire items also sounds really good! Don’t like the idea of them giving you nausea and making nausea arrows, would probably be best to leave those out. I think another good use for mosquitos is that they could have a chance of dropping their proboscis when you kill them, and the mosquitos proboscis could be brewed to make a new potion called the potion of life steal. When youre under the effect of this new potion you can steal 10% health from mobs as you damage them. For example, if the player deals 20 damage to a mob then they would receive 2 health back or 1 heart.</p>\n<p>I really like the idea of using mosquitos as living brewing stands in the comments, would obviously need to nerf and tweak them for that to not make them OP and make actual brewing stands redundant.&nbsp;</p>",
