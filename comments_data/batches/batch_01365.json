I have no clue what they were thinking essentially removing the functionality of pillagers. Instead of them being any sort of threat or raids being a detriment, it’s now just “oh, cool potion that I can use at my leisure and a banner”. Absolutely 0 reason for this change imo, I can understand wanting a new mechanic but why not (as you said) implement it as two separate functions? It’s actually a great idea to let you incur raids by killing a captain and then receiving the bottle in the last wave as a final drop so that you not only have incentive to do raids but also tie in an already intense experience into an even more immersive and fun trial? Mojang really dropped the ball with this change.</p>",
