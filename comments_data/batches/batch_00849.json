Do we have to combine 4 Fortune III to get Fortune V? If enchanted books with Fortune V exists, what if we apply it to a netherite pickaxe? How could early-game players to get so many enchanted books to get such high tier enchantment?</p>\n<p>My idea is to make copper items get better enchantments from enchantment table. Just like golden items are trash in durability, but they are way more likely to get higher tier enchantments from the enchantment table compared to other items. Similar buff could also be applied to copper items. I'd suggest copper items are guaranteed to get high-tier enchantments from that. To be exactly, once an enchantment is rolled for the given copper item, it's always the highest tier (like when Fortune is rolled, it's always Fortune III, Fortune I or II never appear). More bookshelves nearby makes it more likely to have multiple enchantments rolled. This could make copper <strong>the strategic choice for early-game players</strong> who prioritize powerful enchants over durability.</p>",
