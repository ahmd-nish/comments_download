Much more logical would be, that some of the leaves are \"fertile\", means when connected to the trunk and exposed to air, they grow apples. First, they become flowery, then grow apples. Process can be sped up by bees interacting with it. They however, when broken should drop regular apple leaves, so that you had to grow trees to get apples. Maybe all apple leaves could become flowery when bown-mealed? Someone in the comments here suggested these trees should spawn in villages. I agree. Saplings could be grown from apples on farmland.</p>",

Even recently with 1.15, the honeycomb blocks are able to be made with 4 honeycombs but isn't able to be turned back into 4 honeycombs even though in real life you could rip apart a honeycomb into smaller pieces with your bare hands. Maybe because quartz and honeycomb blocks only take 4 items to make? But then you have the Nether Wart Block which takes 9 items to make and still isn't able to be turned back into items, even though it's a farmable item just like wheat, and Hay Bales can be turned back into wheat but Nether Wart Blocks can't be turned back into Nether Warts. It makes no sense. You'd think all farmable items that can be turned into blocks would be able to act as storage blocks. Nope. You'd think Nether Quartz, the second most abundent ore in the game, would be able to be turned into a storage block, especially since every single other ore can. Nope. There's no consistency. The thing is, it wouldn't even be that hard to implement either, an amateur mod maker could add it in under an hour. Why do they not do it then? No idea.</p>",

Hammers could also be affective to make reinforcements on a tool, iron pickaxe with hammer in an anvil would create a reinforced iron pickaxe. Which could give it more durability. </p>\n\n<p>And I also believe when using obsidian arrows, you should be able to use it more than once, 1 arrow can last 2-4 times and will be dropped when a mob is killed. </p>\n\n<p>Love this idea and it’s exactly why I came on here, so I could post this idea. </p>",
