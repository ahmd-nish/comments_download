It would be a common block, but not a block that you don't want in almost any case like granite or diorite. It would probably be better if the world was deeper, but imo something like this would be cool as a mod or even a world type. If they add cubic chunks, (which I don't know if they could do), this would potentially make for a very different mining gameplay.</p>",

I like the grimstone like it is because it goes really well with saying that you're in the new deep underground now, where things get more intense. We need more variation, just mostly stone isn't interesting.

Clicking on a block would leave a colored pixel (maybe 4x4) depending on where the cursor is pointing on the block face. The chalk dust that you leave behind would be its own block like how Glow Lichen works in the new update, but you could fill it with up to 12 colored pixels. You can't draw on all blocks though - I'd make it depend on blast resistance so blocks like dirt or wool won't work. You would be able to dye the chalk from white just like how it works with wool, and it can wash off with water or break instantly with a brush. Probably make it from 3 calcite (and perhaps make calcite renewable by crafting 2 flint with 2 clay?)</p>\n<p>Chalk that you can use to color things would open up a brand new avenue of creativity. You could draw blueprints, make pixel art, mark pathways in caves, or maybe even use it to make pseudo-wallpaper.</p>",
