It could work like...</p>\n<p><br><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>A)</strong></em></span> If you <strong>use an anvil</strong>, and put a book in the first slot and the unwanted enchanted item in the second. The book will only take the top enchantment, and you have to use more books to get more (1 enchantment, one book. 2 enchantments, 2 books. If its enchanted <em>Sharpness II, Looting I, </em>and <em>Unbreaking III,</em> and you only use two books, you get a book with the enchantments <em>Sharpness II </em>and <em>Looting I</em>). You also lose the item that was enchanted, as a kind of balancing tool. Wrong enchantment on a Diamond Sword or want it on a different sword? Lose the diamond. Using this, however, you can take off the enchantments of chain armor or golden swords that you get from mobs. Or, you could even not lose out if you don't have diamond tools and armor yet, and don't have access to books, and not lose out if you enchant your current iron tools. (I prioritized enchanting over tools and armor). Another balancing option is to have it only work if you have the durability higher than a certain percent (only possible if above 50%, 75%, or only if it is at 100%).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>B)</em></span> A new block.</strong> Using this you can get all enchantments in their own respective books. You would still need books, but you could also get the original item back. However, it takes away 50% of the max durability. If your durability depletes completely, you lose the item&nbsp;<em>and </em>the enchantments. Once again, for balancing issues.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em>C)</em></span> A new functionality to the Blacksmith.</strong> You can already enchant weapons using the blacksmith, so why not remove them using him? Using a larger amount of emeralds than enchanting, and also trading some books, you could disenchant the items.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>D)</strong></span></em> <strong>A Wondering Trader trade.</strong> We all know of the wondering trader that is in the newest snapshot. While right now his trades are kind of useless, in the future, based on his spawn rates, will have really good trades. maybe only he can disenchant the item, just like the blacksmith above. That way you still hold on to the enchanted item for a long time, and by the time you find him, you may or may not have the enchanted item with you and enough emeralds to make the trade.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just a thought. I really want this functionality added, so please listen and review this functionality. If you want more Why, How, or What to this idea, let me know!</p>",

It looks like you and the people that upvoted this are simply jealous of the owners of these very valuable accounts and just can't deal with the fact there are some things you will never get to have. Just deal with it!</p>\n<p>Also, what you said about it being a feature until 2016 is false. You were only able to create an account or reserve a name with 1-2 characters when the game was new (around 2010). The account \"8\" was created in early 2015, simply because the user already had the username reserved at the very early stages of the game.</p>",
