        "body": "<p>I really like this idea. I really do. I have said to myself that bigger and better dungeons would be a major step up to the dungeons we have today. But, these dungeons would have to be a little bit harder than whet you've put in here. I don't think 4-8 spawners is going to cut it. If we are talking about loot, like tools, diamonds and enchantment books, then having more spawners will make the dungeons more balanced.</p>\n<p>For Example:<br>1) You don't want to have a dungeon that just lets players walk inside and take all of the loot. That would be a heavy unbalance to the game.<br>2) The dungeons rarity would have to be quite low, as having them spawn at the rate of ravines would make them to easy to find.<br>3) If these dungeons are able to spawn in the Nether/End, they are going to have to have more loot and more enemies, or finding them just wouldn't be worth it.<br>4) If we are talking about dungeons that can have different features depending on what biome they're in, that means that they may have to have items and loot based around that biome.<br>5) Going back to the rarity thing, bigger dungeons might be better off if they are more rare.</p>\n<p>Just to remind you, I do really like this idea, and in total, I don't see many problems with it. There aren't any major problems with this idea. Plus, Minecraft is heavily overdue for these types of ideas.</p>",

A 7x7 area doesn't live up to it's name. We could improve that by giving them a big, random shape, when you enter, there will be 3-5 spawners with zombies, skeletons, or spiders. Later on you will find redstone dispensers, and a new mob, the guardian. 3 blocks tall, 1.5 blocks wide, and 1 block long. They would be heavily armored, with the mercenary armor from minecraft dungeons, with a small improvement. They would wield a battleaxe and guard the treasure room. It would have diamonds, gold, iron, emeralds, and 0-3 netherite scraps. And normal dungeon/desert temple/ mineshaft loot.

To decrease the Mob Farm have these pocket dimensions be more like events, lasting only about 4 hours real-time (12 game days) and then they close and regenerate. On Peaceful and Normal a player trapped inside would be teleported to the archway, Hard and Hardcore would fall to void, items stored in chests in the dungeon would be lost. Every game day a gong/alarm would do the count down from 12 rings. So if you only hear 1 gong in the dungeon you have 20 minutes to escape. This would allow for mixing blocks/mobs from all dimensions, so you never know your loot, or danger you will face in what combination. As an optional risk/reward with no ability to farm and a limited time frame, I think would add playability. Especially if they even only start randomly every few full moons.&nbsp;</p>",

Similar to the smithing templates, archeology should be done around different structures too. We would need a ancient structure though, and the two structures which could be classified \"ancient\" are the Jungle Temples and Ocean Ruins. You would need to add more than just suspicious sand though, because random blocks of sand wouldn't look all to well with dirt and gravel. A solution would be to add suspicious dirt and suspicious gravel and then sprinkle them around the ancient structures. With these new blocks we can have pottery shards uniqe to the structure making pots more customizable. The last thing I have in mind is ancient villages. These villages would be the remains of the ancient builders villages in which they lived in many hundreds of years ago. With a structure like ancient villages they could be havens for archeology. with suspicious gravel, dirt, and sand everywhere along with ruined and buried stone and mud houses. unqi or all shards could be found here. As your digging you can dig up the story of what happened there and why they were ruined or abandoned. Along with brushing, you could find buried houses and rooms with loot inside and possible treasure maps and structure maps to mineshafts, temples, strongholds and more. With the ruined houses, there could be a in game reference on how to make golems similar to the ruined portal.&nbsp;</p>",

The player would have to fight a star guardian which is a brand of wither skeletons with armor. They would drop keys to open the holders. Put four nether star shards in a crafting table and get a formed nether star.</p>\n<p>Chains- Nether fortresses would have hanging chains. The player can use these chains in crafting chain-mail armor, or just use them for decoration.</p>\n<p>Sulfur pools- Toxic to the touch they spawn as falling traps for those unlucky explores who fall. You can bucket the sulfur for a short time before it breaks the bucket. Only gold buckets can pick up sulfur. A bucket of sulfur can be used to increase how much smelting can be done. One bucket of sulfur allows 3 stacks of items to smelt in one given moment. Buckets of sulfur when they hit water evaporates the water. When sulfur hits lava, the sulfur would disappear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The current nether fortress design and aesthetic doesn't fit in with the style of mobs now prevalent in the Nether.</p>\n<p>Also, the Casual Friday 20w07a stream came off as kind of pompous and condescending. Fans obviously want more content than just mobs and some tiny biomes. This is the \"Nether Update\". Make it grand. Have the Nether be more than just a weird progression stepping stone. Actually make the dimension complex, interesting, and able to rival the Overworld as a viable option for long term play.</p>",

A black-colored nether fortress designed for wither skeletons with soul-fire lanterns would also be cool. (I'm kinda connecting how Piglins currently hate wither skeletons and soul-fire lanterns.) I don't think new blocks would be needed for the wither skeleton structure, because coal seems to be connected to wither skeletons. I don't think this large amount of coal would be unfair considering the nether is full of lava and lava does the same things that coal does. (Fuel and lighting.) With all the new blocks and features being added to the game, I believe that the nether fortress has great potential.</p>\n<p>Edit: Wow! I love the new biome added to Minecraft in a snapshot (The basalt delta). Maybe this dark variant of the nether fortress I mentioned could be made from Blackstone instead of coal... Surely would look better. I'd also love to see some Blackstone included in the design of the normal nether fortress. I also wanted to add that I love how much detail the village houses got in 1.14 and I kinda expect to see similar amounts of detail in the nether fortress if it were to get updated. I love the direction Minecraft is taking as a game, but it would be a bit disappointing to have the fortresses not updated in the Nether Update. (Still one of my favorite games, though.)</p>",

My idea is about changing the base structure of the dungeon (or to have various structural designs) and to have some kind of a goal for your need to be there (like: to get an item/s in order to craft something, achieve an achievement and so on). To be introduced a new mob/s like Nether Guards (It just got in my head about the name, haha) and to be obtained something from them (netherite ore, potions, piece of armor) and also maybe to add new blocks which are obtainable only from this dungeon. For my last thing for the list of new things: to have some kind of an underground (or a cool platform on the top the Nether Fortress) room where you have to fight a boss (Fire Dragon; Soul Dragon; Nether King; Abomination Of The Dead) and of course - new drops from him/her.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading the comments and please share, add or change something which I wrote. More people to think for a specific idea , thus more minds are focused for a great thing !</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Remember mojang, the nether is a hellish dimension, and not a mushroom and pig creature dimension with monsters with floating and walking heads. Also, soulsand valleys should have giant monsters. Fossils don't come from thin air. Also, grim reapers should be boss mobs that can transport souls to the nether. More temples should be made, and ghosts should replace ghasts. This is mainly since ghasts are floating heads with weird tentacle thingies popping out of the bottom. Whoever came up with that has a strange view of what the nether would've been like. I hope they can turn the nether around and make a nether update 2.0 just like what they did with the aquatic update.</p>",

The closer to the center, the harder it gets. Something like:\n<br />\"outskirts\" stage would be poor and bland, just like the fortresses that we have right now. \n<br />The \"near center\" area would have some buildings and rooms, but with new mobs and better loot in the chests. Maybe it could look like someone actually lived here, just like in the Chocolate Quest mod castles (there's paintings, bookshelves, beds and things that would be in a normal Minecraft house).\n<br />And in the center of the fortress would be the sole, large castle (it would look the best in biomes like soulsand valley, because it would be an impressive sight if in open space, something like a massive castle with many side towers attached to it in a chaotic way) with different rooms and maybe a boss on the top. And maybe low chances of getting netherite scraps from chests. In my opinion Minecraft needs more endgame structures to make exploring the world more intresting and worth it. I hope You liked the idea :)</p>",

Perhaps incorporate something with the dragon egg so it provides a lengthier journey, whereas the current version can become bland to the average player following the defeat of the dragon and wither. As of now we have the 2 main bosses in the game being the Wither which is primarily fought in the overworld and the dragon which is the current endgame boss. But why stop there, why not have some sort of shrine in the fortress that you have to progress to after defeating the dragon and claiming the egg as your own? Perhaps even the long awaited addition of a baby dragon, and even the addition of a gauntlet to fight through, almost like the raid. but in a Colosseum, having the player fend off waves of nether enemies to protect the egg while it hatches. If you fail and the mobs destroy the egg, you lose the egg and have to go fight the dragon again to get a new one, if you complete it, a baby dragon as a pet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I've made rough designs for a Colosseum style to match with MinesCrafter02's design (size and color subject to change)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/iqvfIz22AlAbV5sMUuJlLw.png\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/U5uxRFpznJZksROn9j8vxQ.png\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/tB4F0kDKSB-v_JKTnodqQA.png\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/F1qTx8-paruaiIT4U8Rk3A.png\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/dr7sdZknuEkqxk4AYFASuQ.png\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/y0h1jOHZKBhLG7Cle6QIPQ.png\"></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n</ul>",

Look at the Blackstone blocks and bricks, we received them a week before but judging off the snout on one of the blocks we could tell it made up Piglin Bastions. This was the same week they added the new nether bricks. Also, I checked the blocks out on the bedrock beta and the new blocks aren't at all the same color as the older nether brick. The new blocks are more darker and vibrant, and don't match the old blocks as well. I also am hoping for a rarer red nether brick fortress variant to make things more interesting.</p>",

I would personally make it less blocky with lower foundations being more cracked and detailed, would like if corridors and bridges in the Fortress were decorated and would come in different shapes, like one could be higher and another one lower. Crossings may be bigger in appearance and blaze spawner platforms could be more challenging and have a dungeon-ish look. The generation of the Fortress is also a problem as it most of the time is in weird location which makes it go through the area creating unaesthetic feel and bland look. It may also have vegetation growing on it as well as Crimson* or (Warped (if ever added)) bricks that could add more similarities to the environment that it is generated in. More loot and challenging areas with maybe some kind of lava or fire traps and holes in the bridges would make the Fortress so much more better visually with it's own mood and feel, also more dangerous and exciting to explore. This structure deserves justice.</p>",

One per fortress.</li>\n<li>Treasure Room- A grand room filled with chests of good loot. Guarded heavily by mobs. Hard to spot from the outside</li>\n<li>Brewing Room- A small room with a single brewing stand. A new piglin variant ala witch guards it. Gets mad if you break or use a brewing stand.

If villagers somehow happen to learn how to use machinery and build it, a school might be an option. A daycare, however, would do.</p>",

They could have these features:</p>\n<p>- Steering wheel</p>\n<p>- 1 bed</p>\n<p>- At least 1 chest with some good loot such as a pirate hat, spyglass, emeralds, gold, sword, etc</p>\n<p>- Flag</p>\n<p>- Minimum 1 and maximum 4 players can ride the boat at any 1 time</p>\n<p>- I'm thinking cannons may be too complex, but I still think they'd be a great addition the player could use to defend themselves</p>\n<p>A boat wouldn't just fall into the hands of the player. In order to declare a pirate ship your own, you would have to fight off the illager pirates that dwell there. If you kill each one, this ship becomes yours.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time, I'm aware that my suggestions are asking a lot but if Mojang does ever add these types of boats ingame, I have faith that they will do it well.</p>",

I recently spent some time in the Mojave desert and I recently discovered the minecraft desert is nowhere near as accurate as a real desert. I think a few things should be added: </p>\n\n<p>• Cactus variations (prickly pear cactus, barrel cactus, etc)\n<br />• Peickly pear fruit derived from the prickly pear cactus. Fruit will grow atop the cactus and can be picked when ripe, goes through the 3 stages of growing like a coco pod.\n<br />• Desert animals! Like geckos (extremely common in the desert) which could be tamed, snakes, coyote, desert birds (woodpecker, humming bird, etc.)\n<br />• New shrub variations\n<br />•Small desert plants like grasses and succulents, aloe is common\n<br />• The prickly pear fruit can be made into other foods like prickly pear pie, also adding to the food types (also in dire need of a revamp)\n<br />• Maybe to enhance the heat and stuff of the desert, hunger can go down a bit faster? The need to drink water in minecraft would be cool. We can drink water out of the water bottles we already currently have. I also think rather than drinking milk out of the buckets to cure poison and clear status effects we should be able to empty the bucket into a cauldron and fill 3 bottles, or instead of just into the cauldron maybe as a crafting recipe\n<br />• Aloe Vera gel, crafted using 2 aloe Vera leaves (obtained by destroying an aloe Vera plant). Used in potion making to create potion of quenching (makes it so that you don’t get hungry or thirsty as fast, particularly in the desert)</p>\n\n<p>Let’s make minecraft survival even more awesome!</p>",

Maybe instead of just dead saplings there could be dead grasses, some more kinds of cacti, the occasional oasis... Maybe a new structure, desert ruins, perhaps like the desert temple but all collapsed and such.</p>\n<p>Also, what’s up with all the rivers in deserts? That’s not very desert-y. That leads me to another idea: Dried Streambeds! As well as Dried Lakebeds, perhaps with a new block called “dried clay” or something.</p>\n<p>I think in general Minecraft biome seems could use a lot more variety, I realize this is hard for the team but so much more couldn’t be done for the the adventuring aspect.

I've always loved the idea of dungeons getting harder and crazier the deeper you go. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe some sort of secret underground pillager hideout?

Whenever I think of a dungeon, I think of a big, treasure-filled place just waiting to be explored, like the ones in&nbsp;<em>Zelda.&nbsp;</em>When I look at the dungeons in Minecraft, they're small, the loot in the chests could be better, and with all the new hostile mobs added to Minecraft, the monsters in the dungeons now seem kind of weak sauce. There should be secret rooms, more dangerous mobs, better treasure, etc. This might add to the exploring element of Minecraft since even the caves are almost the same as they were 10 years ago. Just a thought.</p>\n<p>Edit: I don't want to leave out that you guys are doing great adding new blocks and food and even some mobs. To me, however, new food, blocks, and even weapons alone don't really interest me if there's nothing new to explore, not just to collect or tame. Good job, though.</p>",

When you go into the portal, the game reads the text on the sign and uses that text in a HashMap or whatnot to find the other portal and then send you into it. This would be extremely efficient and people could make private portals by generating them with long strings of random text. If people didn't place a sign it should generate a random matching portal 20000 blocks from the player in any dimension. That way it adds to the lore of the game with the fallen portals. :D</p>",

        "body": "<p>I would also like portals that connect two places in the same dimension. It would definately have an impact on how some servers operate, that's for sure. Nether railways would be a thing of the past though as there really wouldn't be a reason to take on that risk or expend those resources. <br><br>As such, maybe the portals should require materials that are far more difficult to find? For example, Diamond Blocks? It takes 9 diamonds to make one diamond block and if it followed the same rules in nether portal generation you would need a minimum of 10 diamond blocks - or 90 diamonds - to make a single teleporter. That level of expense would mean that people would still use rails for shorter range transportation and would save the diamonds for the long range transport.<br><br>Additionally, wouldn't this need some way of telling the portal which it's other half is? Unlike interdimensional portals, which generate on the other side, you'd need to tell it where it's other half is. So, maybe a craftable tool made from redstone that lets to \"attune\" two portals together? You use it on the first poral after it is built and activate it. It won't take you anywhere, but the portal will be lit. Then you go to the second portal, use it again, and it activates. The second portal would basically have been told the coordinates of the first portal by the device and, upon seeing a valid portal present, it makes the connection allowing you to travel between them.<br><br><br></p>",
