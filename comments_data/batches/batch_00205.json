I think it would spawn on top of high rocky plateaus and there would jungle trees on top of them. If this biome where in the game I think it could have a special weather event: fog, fog would be a weather event that makes it very hard to see, it would be white and misty and you would only see the outlines of objects through the fog. I also have an idea for a yeti mob that would be very scary and be about as large and strong as the warden mob from the cave update, although it wouldn't be blind making it very dangerous. Another mob that could be implemented would be the roc, the roc is a large bird of prey in middle eastern mythology that I think would be perfect for this biome. It would be a boss mob that would have a nest high up in the mountains and it would swoop down and pick up the player dropping them from a high height dealing fall damage. Beating the roc would reward the player with a rocs feather which is an item from MC Dungeons, holding it and right clicking would send the player high into the air which would be very useful for elytra flight. This is an edited version of the suggestion I wrote out and then realized that it was already a suggestion, anyways I hope this added to your idea as this would be a very cool biome to have in the game!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Others are too far fetched but this would fit well with other Minecraft concepts and biomes. I feel like this concept fits the \"Minecraft Game Design\" (2019) by by <a href=\"https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Jens+Bergensten%22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jens Bergensten</a> in several ways. Firstly, it expands \"The Mysteries\" (Bergensten, 35). Though partially subjective, I feel that this additionally feels very \"Vanilla\" (Bergensten, 65). I believe that because a trench can be seen even from elytra height that this biome would fit well with the rule \"Finding things is fun. Searching for them is not\" (Bergensten, 53). Finally, I feel that Minecraft has been excellent at being silly however, I think that the Warden has been a step in the right direction. This biome would be a great way to expand on the rule \"Minecraft is scary\" (Bergensten, 25). Many mods try to add a scary monster but some of the most memorable scary elements of Minecraft are environmental, such as cave sounds. A trench or Abyss is perfect for Minecraft's type of scary. After all, the ocean is one of the scariest places in real life! I would love to see Minecraft's take on the scariness of the depths! Lastly, an Abyss adds to \"Exploration\" and \"Adventure\" (Bergensten, 7, 8)! &nbsp;</p>",
