Stalactites and stalagmites exist in about a thousand modifications, but that wouldn't prevent them from adding them. What they mean is that they're always trying to have their original take on any concept or any specific feature that may exist elsewhere. They don't want to just be copy-pasting ideas from mods because it may cause a lot of conflict and confusion, and because they want the base game to have a different overall direction. Taking inspiration from a mod and adding a feature to the base game because it exists in a certain mod is not the same as adding features that also occur differently in certain mods. There are a lot of decisions and calculations that go into development, and as they've mentioned before they've a ton of original ideas. You can't really decide what limits the developers' options without being a developer for yourself.</p>",

Cave biomes, stalactites and stalagmites, Copper Ore and a lot of other features have been in tons of mods before, and now they're making their way into Minecraft. The developers are having a unique take on all of these concepts that fits the direction of Minecraft, instead of taking inspiration from mods about these features. They did that in the very beginning because the design and direction of the game was not fully developed, and they needed direct inspiration to guide them towards developing it. Now that the direction of the game is fully determined, they want to let people know that they are having their own perspective on any features. They don't want people to just spam them with suggestions to add a feature from this or that mod. They still take inspiration from the entire community, but now as the game is at this stage of development, every feature needs to be original to Minecraft's design.</p>",

If you are visiting every thread that may be tangentially related&nbsp;to your idea and going \"but I have something over here take a look\" everywhere, that's definitely overkill (you know it, I know it, I'm saying it anyway). And if you're tempted to do that, it's likely we probably have too many duplicate threads going on, and please <strong>just send this to the feedback button</strong> instead of posting about it. There's a lot of different ways to quibble over the rules and just how far those go, so let's just say:&nbsp;Err on the side of caution.</p>\n<p>Things are still getting ironed out, bugs are still getting filed daily on our side, and a report button is on the list, but in the meantime use the feedback button&nbsp;if you're seeing duplicates, and it will get to me.</p>\n<p>&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've always tried to explain exactly&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;I dislike the idea rather than simply dismissing it as bad, and I've usually been able to find at least one positive thing to say about each idea. Is that enough?</p>\n<p>Yes, that's constructive. <strong>Thank you for doing this.</strong> As long as it's constructive, that's absolutely fine. Explaining why you like things too also helps people form excellent feedback and suggestion ideas.</p>\n<p>Constructive and informative feedback (like this topic and to each other) is absolutely going to help our efforts here to make our site excellent and useful.</p>\n<p>Thanks for these questions, I love having meta discussions, and hope as we settle in we'll end up having less of these!</p>",

But either way the customer support should be better that what it is right now. If you go to the twitter account of Mojang customer support you just see tweets of this same problem over and over again and see people saying for everyone to abandon hope on the replies of those same tweets because there are people that are waiting already for a huge amount of time and still don't have their problems fixed. As much as i want to say that Majong is struggling and for everyone to just be patient that everything will back to normal soon enough, that doesn't seem to be the case and as much as Majong is struggling, so are us. We want to play the game and we could understand if it was going to take a week or two until you would reach our tickets, but it's completely outrageous the fact that people are actually waiting for months and even giving up completely.</p>\n<p>I also think that just having a bot replying to all the messages that are sent to the customer support on twitter is not that great either. People are going there mainly because they already tried sending an email and that it didn't do anything at all.</p>\n<p>Please for the love of the game and the community as well, try to fix this as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>I really hate to see the fact that people are literally giving up thinking that they won't get any help, and i hate that i'm also almost with no faith either.</p>",
