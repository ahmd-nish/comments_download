        "body": "<p>Either the maximum armour would need to be increased, or the armour from one or more of the other armour parts would need to be reduced to make room for the bracers. I'm more in favour of the former--if the player is paying the extra cost in resources for more armour, they should be rewarded with more armour. Perhaps make it provide a similar value to the leggings. As armour was being phased out in our real world history, it was the armour on the feet and legs that went away before the armour on the hands and arms.</p>\n<p>Possible armour values:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leather Bracers: 2(1)A</li>\n<li>Gold Bracers: 3(1.5)A</li>\n<li>Copper Bracers: 3(1.5)A</li>\n<li>Chainmail Sleeves: 4(2)A</li>\n<li>Iron Bracers: 5(2.5)A</li>\n<li>Diamond Bracers: 6(3)A+2(1)T</li>\n<li>Netherite Bracers: 6(3)A+3(1.5)T+1(10%)KBR</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would modify the armour values of the full sets to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leather: 7(3.5)A&lt;9(4.5)A</li>\n<li>Copper: 10(5)A&lt;13(6.5)A</li>\n<li>Gold: 11(5.5)A&lt;14(7)A</li>\n<li>Chainmail: 12(6)A&lt;15(7.5)A</li>\n<li>Iron: 15(7.5)A&lt;20(10)A</li>\n<li>Diamond: 20(10)A+8(4)T&lt;26(13)A+10(5)T</li>\n<li>Netherite: 20(10)A+12(6)T+4(40%)KBR&lt;26(13)A+15(7.5)T+5(50%)KBR</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, this would mean that someone in full Diamond or Netherite would be totally immune to most damage, at least until their armour points drop down to below 25 armour, or 12.5 armour bits. Depending on who you ask, this could be a worthy reward for resource expenditure of the two rarest resources, or boringly OP. Still though, the idea of making a full set of Iron Armour able to fill out the armour bar feels right in a way. If this were to happen in this way, it would also be ideal to represent armour greater than 20 by retexturing overlapping armour point with diamond, especially since diamond or better are the only way to acquire that layer of defense naturally.</p>",

But if Blunderbusses and muskets, and even cannons are too futuristic for the mine craft world, then it must be that we are seeing a game in the bronze gold or iron ages, guns would not fit minecraft at all.
