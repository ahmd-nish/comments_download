There are so many posts that say \"make X stronger because its too easy\" when the problem is not health bars and damage, its progression. To achieve what you're going for I think that progression to the next 'area' somehow requires diverse materials from previous areas. For instance, what if the recipe for diamond armor includes chain mail? Now if you want to progress to the next tier of armor, you need to either kill enough mobs or trade with villagers. In this example, getting to the next tier requires interacting with other systems of the game.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What if Survival Mode, Lava generates a debuff region around it called 'Extreme Heat' which gives you slowness, nausea, weakness and hunger in a 3 Block radius. Its temporarily curable with water bottles, or negated by armor upgraded (at a Smithing Table) with Blue Ice. With this change, the lower levels of caves are much harder to explore and the Nether is near impossible to traverse. To progress easily the player has to have explored Ice Spike regions and messed with the Enchanting Table, or come prepared with Water Bottles gotten through sand smelting or villager trading.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The list can go on, but the key to the idea is that gathering the right materials makes traversing the next area simpler. To get the right materials, you have to explore/interact more in previous and current regions.</span></p>",

Like you said, it's far too easy to avoid monsters. My corrections to this are as follows:</p>\n<p>1) Beds speed up time instead of skipping it. This means you can choose between doing things in your base or waiting out the night doing nothing, with the latter speeding up the time until sunrise.</p>\n<p>2) As such, mobs still spawn even if you sleep. I think they should spawn around you like they used to if you sleep in darkness, making sleeping only possible in a light and fortified base.</p>\n<p>3) You can't sleep with less than 12 hunger points and due to time speeding up, you lose hunger points while sleeping. If you drop below 12, you're kicked out of bed. This forces players to be prepared before sleeping and necessitates a base that has farms or food storage.</p>",

Instead of completely getting rid of beds, there should be a fatigue meter (a meter separate from the hunger one of course) that fills up the more you exert yourself doing stuff like fighting enemies, mining, etc. Sleeping, like it does in real life, should just restore your energy not completely skip a day. This feature almost completely makes hostile mobs like zombies, skeletons, and other mobs that burn in the day useless. Unless you're in a cave or another dark place, you won't come across these mobs unless it's also raining. Even in this situation, what prevents you from just digging a big enough hole, placing a bed and sleeping to avoid trouble?</p>\n<p>Edit: It might sound like an illogical reason to remove beds completely skipping days, especially if it keeps you from losing your items by dying from mobs like zombies and skeletons and spiders. The problem is though that these mobs added an inevitable challenge, and challenges in games are fun. Sleeping makes these mobs less of a problem and that can affect the survival aspect of the game.&nbsp;</p>",
