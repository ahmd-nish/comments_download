Copper is currently is found near iron or around that level which i feel is intetional since they could have made it generate anywhere in the snapshot (not to mention its gonna be found in vains). Also having to use wood for so long is kinda frustrating and diamond is also not too hard to get if you know where to look. So technically you could make the same argument for replacing diamond teir wich isnt realistic either.</p>",
