Combining this with a conduit (which requires a heart of the sea, giving it new life) and perhaps a wither rose will create a living, beating, animated Warden's Heart that will stops hostile mobs spawning and endermen teleporting within a very large radius from where it's placed. It can act in a similar way to a conduit, but more compact. This makes sense as the Warden is the only mob that can spawn in the deep dark (all other hostile mobs are terrified of it?).\n<br />This comes from a desire to mob proof cities and large builds that incorporate darker, atmospheric lighting or lack thereof, instead of having to painstakingly light up every crevice, which limits creativity. Light can be a beautiful tool to play with when it isn't a requirement.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I think that when the sculk spreads onto ores, it will change the ore into Sculk Ore. When mined you'll get raw skulk ore and you can smelt it into Sculk Bars. With those you can craft it into sculk armor, tools, blocks, and arrows. The sculk armor will start off weak but by killing enemies and getting their exp. , the armor will get stronger and will slightly change its appearance. After a specific amount of exp. is collected, it will be equal to netherite. The main use for it is in the deep dark. Armor and tools don't create sound and when there is sound, the armor will absorb it depending on how leveled up the armor and tools are. It absorption range also depends on the armor's level. Example: If you're running in the deep dark, you will not produce any sound and the sculk sensor will not create a signal. But if you're armor is not upgraded enough you must be very close to the sound to absorb it, while if you're armor is fully upgraded, the range of which it could absorb the sound is much greater. The arrows also don't create a signal nor do any of the weapons or tools. The armor will make you receive less damage from the warden and the tools will do more damage to it compared to regular weapons (also depending on how leveled up they are). The armor will look like regular netherite but dark green when first made, but over time when you collect exp. small protrusions and horns will appear across the armor. (Thanks for reading)</p>",

Almost everyone who plays bedrock loves getting to endgame as quick as possible so we could mess with our friends or just build anything that comes to mind. This makes the furnace xp farms crucial for our own enjoyment. Bedrock players looked at Java players with envy as they could get thousands of levels and could use their overpowered enderman farms and automatic fish farms. This just doesn’t seem fair and we want the furnace xp back. Most of us will not enjoy the game anymore and most of us wil turn away to other games after this. Mojang please bring this back. </p>",

Not only will this provide players with a recognisably End-themed armour, it will also allow players to have more vanity options in the game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Considering Netherite Armour has Knockback Resistance built into it (an attribute shared with the Wither), I think that it would be cool if the End Armour had an attribute shared with the Dragon - advanced healing capabilites. This would switch things up for players who enjoy PvP and for players who struggle with the combat side of vanilla survival minecraft, should they get to this point.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think the Ore should be found similarly to Netherite, but not exactly. You know those small island with an almost circular top?

        "body": "<p>A noteblock GUI would be fantastic. Rather than using blocks to specify the instrument, and repetitive clicking to get the note, a GUI would make it so much easier and quicker to create in-game music. Further more, without needing to use blocks to set the instrument, songs could be more compact to fit inside smaller builds and all parts to be within range of hearing.<br>Perhaps, to set the instrument, you'd still need to \"fuel\" it with the relevant block (maybe like Beacons but where you get the block back if you destroy the note block)</p>\n<p>I would also suggest that various other noteblock features could be implemented as part of this, such as sustained (longer duration) notes and more instruments.</p>\n<p>Heck this could be a mini update (like 1.15 Buzzy Bees) all by itself.</p>",

Exatclty this!</p>\n<p>-Maybe a few more instruments that can fit the update theme.</p>\n<p>-Add 1 lower and 1 upper octave.</p>\n<p>-Add a simple UI to set the note value. My guess is that the note value is either an int or some kind of enum, probably wrong on this one. This will save us soo much time. Please consider at least this!</p>\n<p>I know adding the octaves will be a lot of work cause all the different instruments soo maybe you can start with just the original sounds to test it with the UI.</p>\n<p>My idea for the UI will be probably something like this:</p>\n<p>-Show the block bellow the noteblock and the instrument name.</p>\n<p>-Highlight the selected note.(default = 0).</p>\n<p>-Show only 1 octave 7+5(12) keys and make it soo you can cange it like pages in a web app for example. The canculation can be something like notevalue = key(1-12) * octave(0-4). Not sure how duable this is tho. :D</p>\n<p>I really hope at least 1 person on this amazing team is passionate about music. I hope this bumps this post and you consider adding even just the UI. Thank you for keep adding these amazing upgrades and keeping minecraft alive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
