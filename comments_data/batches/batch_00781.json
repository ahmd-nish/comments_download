        "body": "<p>Erosion is basically a part of everything they're doing to world generation with the Caves &amp; Cliffs update. Caves in real life entirely form due to erosion caused by water streams like rivers, combined with tectonic motion. Rivers themselves form from mountain valleys and lakes, which are also associated with different forms of erosion. You're really not asking for anything specific here. Erosion does not just add complexity, it is basically how structures like caves form. Besides, world generation as it currently stands for 1.18 is already very dramatic, and gets quite complex when combining all of its individual aspects. Sure, I think it should be a bit more smooth in specific cases, mainly when caves combine with each other or the surface, but that is still being fully worked on according to Henrik Kniberg. Making generation considerably more extreme or complex would be too overboard, and the caves and mountains wouldn't feel balanced compared to the rest of the world generation if they were to be more dramatic than they currently are. There needs to be a limit to generation complexity so that it still fits with the rest of the game, and Mojang has already struck a balance that the majority of the community is satisfied with according to Twitter polls.</p>",

They are meant to detect any and all significant movements (also known as vibrations or game events). Ambient sounds like music, bells, mob sounds are, well, ambient. They’re not significant movements and therefore do not count as vibration. When it comes to things that it actual views as vibrations, the Sculk Sensor doesn’t nitpick. It will be so odd and unnecessary to have a Sculk Sensor that doesn’t detect all vibrations, simply because it is a natural creature, not a player controlled device. How on Earth would a being skulking in the depth of the world differentiate between vibrations from redstone components and vibrations from other sources, especially when they can have overlapping in-game frequencies? All it does is provide power when it senses movement, so it wouldn’t really know what redstone components are. Besides, what practical use would that provide?</p>",
