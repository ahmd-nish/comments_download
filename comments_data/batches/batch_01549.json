Have you considered adding one to your Wyverns or do you feel it wouldn't fit the feel your going for?</p>\n\n<p>Also what if witches could spawn on the backs of wyverns? Since there is very little chance of mojang adding broomsticks anytime soon this is most sertainly the next best thing in my opinion. Would also be cool if witches could pull out a witch dagger the way vindicator pulls out an axe. Just a thought.</p>\n\n<p>Finally I was looking at the taming method. I like the idea you came up with but I also feel just holding a gold ingot is a cheaty way to disable the Wyvern. Considering how easy it is to come across gold in the overworld. It would remove their fear factor. One possible idea is they could have nests that you could attempt to rob. Raising the egg as your own, letting the baby Wyvern imprint on you.</p>\n\n<p>Those are just a few ideas I thought I'd throw out there. I absolutely love the idea of the mythos dimension. I do hope to see it added in game. Especially the wyverns. You don't know how hard it actually is to try to add them through add-ons until you've tried for yourself. The parrot doesn't have a walking animation and the bat never stops flapping unless it's hanging upside down. We definitely need a land+air mob.</p>\n\n<p>Whew! Need to take a breath. Again Love the idea! Hope to see it added. Good luck! You have my vote!</p>",

Is there a possibility horses can go back to how they originally were, when they looked like Mo's creatures horses. They had more depth and didn't look as bad. I used to use horses a tone more before the update because I couldn't get around without feeling off because f the designs. They looked better how they used to appear, legs with two sections, head flat and not with a drop at the muzzle, legs, once again, extended outward subtly in order to show depth, rearing, the opening and closing of the mouth. The armour makes them look bad as well now with the new models, and I've seen a lot of People on LogDotZip's channel in the horse comparison video that greatly miss the old models probably just as much as myself and a large portion of the minecraft community. (I apologize for the length of this but it really does irritate me how they downgraded horses just to up textures and stats, but I'd prefer the old ones over the new ones any day.)</p>",

Honestly, my favourite place to settle down in Minecraft is a village. I've been exploring quite a lot these last two days and moreover I've come across some new villages not that far away from my first one. Thanks to their proximity, I've also noticed that I can reach all those villages easily by foot, but I've seen that there are some worthy ways I could use to move to. I've tried riding a horse these days, but it's not something so worthy as I was thinking. Since these villages are located next to mountains or rivers, I've been becoming aware of the fact that a horse can't really cross a high mountain or just a river. Wish they could overstep them!</p>\n<p>Don't know if you ever experienced something like that before. What should I do to solve somehow this issue? Should I modify the route or is there an easy way I might use to have a nice ride with my horse? I'd be more than glad to hear from you some advices! :)</p>",

The mob will act like any neutral mob flying around you, however when you health gets lower than half health it will start to attack. They fly in groups, and are scared of ghast. Like i said they live in hives or nests on the roof of the nether, when killed maybe they drop glowstone. The ones not near the nest may be found near lava. I hope this information can satisfy.</p>",
