If Mojang is going to add a new and completely different block, then making it 'consistent' is exactly the opposite of that one would want to do. These are the ways that it is inconsistent in that version. It is a light source block that is transparent, does not require constant redstone input to stay on, turns off faster than the redstone lamp, and its different states can be used to give different restone outputs. It also is a block that can be used to offset restone by 1 gametick and can allow for redstone to be twice as fast as it would be otherwise. The first useage is specific to memory which is rather niche, while doubling restone's potential speed is useful in almost every redstone contraption. The two usages just aren't equal. One revolutionizes redstone while the other is quite useful for redstone computer builders, and maybe a few others.</p>",
