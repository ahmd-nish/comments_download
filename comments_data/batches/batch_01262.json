The residents of Chilly Cumulonimbus City need your help.</p>\n<p>To get to the cloud lands, you need to head up a really tall tower. This tower used to be a nice relaxing area for tourists, and also a preparation center for the high altitudes and low oxygen. Now it has become the Storm Tower. This tower now generates horrible storms to the residents living on the island around the tower.</p>\n<p>After climbing the tower, you head to Chilly Cumulonimbus City. The city is abandoned, only inhabited by cloudy mobs, corrupted by the Dreadful Stratus, only wanting to maintain his power. The Dreadful Stratus has put cloud walls, cloud gates, cloud keys, and mist into the city, so it's a maze to get to his base.</p>\n<p>After navigating the maze of the city, you are in the Stratus Skyscraper. A 20-floor high skyscraper, with puzzles, ambushes, and more. It only gets more difficult from here. Once you get to the roof, you walk across a wooden plank that doesn't look like it'll last any longer. It drops. You fight The Dreadful Stratus. After that, you head down on a cloud slide back down to the island.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Or...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Instead of going down the slide, you head to a cloud park called \"Aerial Astronomics.\" All you do here is have a race against time for a reward, and have fun in low gravity jumps!</p>",

They come in rarities which dictate the ability, such as a common card that gives you 10% more damage on the next floor or a rare one that makes all mobs on the current floor return on the next floor as allies or ultra rare ones such as a summoned pet that consumes all consumables in a large radius around the player to save time.</p>",
