First, the fact something is stronger than netherite, a thing literally found in h*ll, is over passed by something that sound worthless, but it's protected by a super boss so I can get pass that one. The second thing is, if reinforced deepslate is supposed to be stronger than netherite why isn't it in the crafting recipe. We had diamonds improved by covering it in netherite, all I'm saying is netherite should be \"cover\" by reinforce deepslate. Plus I think netherite should have built in fire protection. Thank you for a wonderful game and the opportunity to improve it.</p>",
