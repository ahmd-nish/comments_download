I just feel like it would make golden tools and armor completely useless since you would preffer to use your gold to make rose gold at the cost of losing a little bit of enchantability. Also the fact that rose god didn't exist in ancient times and that it would be even heavier than gold so it wouldn't make much sense but eh, gold and diamond already don't make sense so whatever, Minecraft logic.</p>\n<p>Maybe rose gold could kinda be a side-tier of iron like gold kinda is a side-tier of wood and copper a side-tier of stone.</p>",
