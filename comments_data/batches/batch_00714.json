The changes they've made mean that Diamond or blobs are more common but tend to be smaller, which creates more of a journey for the players and encourages them to move and explore more rather than 2 blobs and you're set. They can potentially and very rarely get up to 23 blocks big, so there's still that jackpot aspect to it. The challenge now is reaching the Diamond levels and exploring and surviving down deep where there is no coal, a lot of lava, ambushes of mobs that you need to deal with and light up for and the stone is twice as hard. They're harder to reach, but you should be finding a lot more if you're exploring at huge caves down deep, and especially underwater because the decreased air exposure doesn't apply there; and I'm talking from experience. I wouldn't recommend strip-mining unless you're really not prepared for caving, because while they should be as common as before through strip-mining it'll take you twice as long; I haven't tested that so I can't tell.</p>",

Instead of 'dig sites' it would be great if archaeology paired with an overhaul of the oldest structures in the game (temples, dungeons, stronghold) and the addition of ruins on land to match the ones in the ocean. </p>\n<p>Archaeology could be focused around these structures. Each structure would offer a pool of common shards (blank, tree, flower, animals..) and one or two shards unique to that structure. To collect all the shards in the game you would need to travel to a variety of structures sometimes visiting multiples of the same structure to claim the rarest shards and giving the player a reason to adventure out even into the late game. Shards then become trophies of your adventures as well as a story telling device allowing you to show off your rarest as pots and maybe also mosaics in item frames.</p>\n<p>I agree with you that diamonds are not the right direction for archaeology loot. Mob heads are a great idea and maybe chain mail and a new record or banner.</p>",
