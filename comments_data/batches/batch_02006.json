I feel like when searching it should only show the recipes you unlocked. If I have specifically have the toggle enabled then I feel like I should only have the recipes I unlocked in search. Turning the toggle off allows players in existing worlds to not have to deal with not knowing recipes or being able to easily craft anything. It would also prevent new players from accidentally getting overwhelmed my new blocks. I also think it should be enabled by default to prevent this issue for new players.</p>",

On these questions...<br>Do players feel they can find the recipes they are searching for?<br>Yes, there is a huge community of minecraft players with a large majority still in the early stages of spelling. Typing Tor, and seeing Comparator is not a bad thing, if I type Compari I would end up with zero results because I spelt the search incorrectly. Members young and old benefit from the currently excellent search. Mojang provides updates to minecraft to add extra items, the exposure to these items is enhanced when you can actually see all items, and increase the exposure.&nbsp;<br>Do players get overwhelmed with too many options rather than finding the ones they were searching for?<br>Not at all, with nearly all items the old method of searching allows a unique way to find items, with very few search terms will you actually find the search overwhelmed, the new method would be a regression.</p>",
