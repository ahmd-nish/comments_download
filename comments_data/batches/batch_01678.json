Because Java is on pc only, auto-clickers are accessible to all players and 99% of the player base is perfectly fine with using autoclickers.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Trident killers were originally a bug. At the end of the day, they were a bug much like the TNT duper system that Mojang said they thought was not only a cool new thing but balanced enough to keep in the game. This however means it's likely difficult to recode from Bedrock to Java since it was never intentionally added and is just something they keep in the game.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Java was already given an alternative. The ONLY good thing to come from the combat update was sweeping edge. This as everyone knows allows the player to kill all the mobs in the kill chamber. Combine this with an auto-clicker and you have the same efficiency as a trident killer.&nbsp;</p>",
