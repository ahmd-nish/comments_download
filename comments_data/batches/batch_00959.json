Mending could possibly use some nerfing where it takes more XP for a \"chance\" of mending. Personally, if enchanting was revamped so it wasn't pure random Mending would be useless for sure in protecting favorite tools/armor/weapons.</p>\n<p>To do that mechanically (and keep the original mechanic) a new table would need to duplicate an enchantment from a book using more XP and Lapis to enchant but allows a player to apply an enchant they want to an item or book. They could use an item too to enchant a new item and the increase XP and Lapis means you have to strategize whether copy or take a chance with luck. The repair cost to resets zero as it is a new item, using an older enchanted item would be a one-time used and consumed feature.</p>\n<p>So you'd have to use the original table to discover enchantments or treasure hunts. And to encourage future use, have so after 3 or so uses an enchanted book could be randomly consumed, meaning your first use should be to copy the enchants to make two books. Being able to customize/optimize enchanting without random grind is something wanted as well, and the fact enchanting is random is why enchants like Mending are popular so you can keep the gear you like for longer, or if care indefinitely.&nbsp;</p>",
