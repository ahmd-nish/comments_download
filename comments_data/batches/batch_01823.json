Everything ends with pickaxes, because stone blocks break too quickly.\n<br />3. Peasant and pastoral fields, fishing grounds, cartography and herb gathering terrain for the cleric, stone quarries for masons cannot be surrounded by a fortress. Indeed, in the VILLAGE, VILLAGE professions are common, not medieval-urban, like a librarian.\n<br />4. The fortress needs a productive economy from the surrounding villages and guards, and the villagers are pacifists.</p>",

Icebergs (and possibly surface ice of nearby normal frozen oceans) would make for plenty of obstacles and provide places for guardians to spawn. Ice could be incorporated into the structures.</p>\n<p>Variant 2: Deep Lukewarm Ocean: This variant would be a lure for ships, with bits poking high enough to wreck ships and maybe the gold out in the open as bait. Shipwrecks would spawn far more commonly&nbsp; in the immediate area (with a few guarenteed) so the guardians would guard the shipwrecks as much as the monument. Shipwrecks would be the main loot here.</p>\n<p>Variant 3: Deep Ocean: Bubble columns of both types would be common. The structure should probably be tall, likely consisting of multiple towers or even floating bits, so that the bubble columns are useful as well as a hinderance.</p>\n<p>Variant 4: Deep Cold Ocean: Current model.</p>",
