Making zombies drop the ores would make less sense to the lore than letting them drop the ingots.Essentially, zombies currently have a chance to drop almost anything you can find commonly in a dungeon chest. They originally added this feature as a way to get an unexpected suprise while killing a low level monster. Like most people, I can can understand 1 iron, or crop to plant as a reward for that small of a task is a good early game reward. An iron block would be too large, and an iron ore drop would defeat the purpose of making the drop rate low as they would now have to work to smelt it as well. As for a reward for drops, ingots are perfect for the job. Less mob variants spawned in the nether when it was added, zombie pigmen being the most common, which is why they chose to do nuggets for them. They may not be as common as they were in the past, but they did add gold to the nether, so we really cant complain. The feature should stay the way it is as a small rewards system for new players.</p>",

There are a lot of mobs without particular weaknesses, and even if there are not, the Warden is the perfect chance to have a mob&nbsp;<strong>without&nbsp;</strong>a weakness. What is the problem if there is a mob you can't possibly kill? Why are so many people skeptical of that? The reward of the Warden is not in killing it or fighting with it. The reward is what you get from the Deep Dark. The Warden creates very unique gameplay by being a mob you need to avoid and be extremely careful around instead of just spamming it with your attacks. It adds a lot of fear and strategy into the Deep Dark that doesn't really exist elsewhere in the game. If it has any weakness, then people will just start to take advantage of that and try to delibirately fight and kill it just to get the sense of achievement.</p>",
