But I feel like there's a Minecraft vanilla formula that's hindering the game's growth too much. Everything needs to fit perfectly into the game, graphics need to be iconic, there's a lot of back-and-forth before ideas are made, and somehow it needs to be kid-friendly, teaching kids that fireflies are bad to frogs, etc.</p>\n\n<p>I feel like Mojang is too afraid of making big changes, afraid of \"copying from modders\". We can't have epic legendary gear from ancient cities, as music discs are a \"smaller and more vanilla friendly\" update. This greatly hinders Minecraft's growth. Additions need to fit into animated trailers too, which further inhibits new ideas.</p>\n\n<p>If this keeps up they'll eventually lose to competitors like Hytale, which has no problems adding what players have always wanted. They don't care about being a PETA education game, a hyper realistic game, or a game hindered by arbitrary rules like \"inhibiting creativity\", they just want to make a fun fantasy survival game.</p>\n\n<p>I think fireflies should be added as simple particle effects in swamps, players have taken a liking to the two-pixel bug ever since the reveal.

ALUNINUM!?&nbsp; the worse replace ment for such an legendary ore. so im begging you and probably many many other people return iron ore. and i think that a lot of people share this feeling with me. so return iron ore and restore the real feel of minecraft.</p>\n<p>thanks</p>",
