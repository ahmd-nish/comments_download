For example, 15 signal strength travelling up to 15 blocks.</p>\n\n<p>It can also be fun to use to levitate players and mobs that have the slow falling effect for games and pranks or to build elytra boost/lift stations in elytra flight races. \n<br />There are many ways propellor blocks/fans could improve transportation in Minecraft and I would love to see them added.</p>\n\n<p>A crafting recipe I have in mind would use 1 copper ingot in the middle left slot, redstone dust in the center, 1 iron ingot above and below the redstone, and cobblestone in the remaining spaces. It would look like an enclosed fan in the crafting interface.</p>",

This takes the creativity out of redstone.</p>\n<p>you can build the ‘randomizer’ if you have 2-4 pistons (not sticky), on each side of an empty space. Place an observer coming out of every one of the pistons, and connect the pistons up to a redstone wire. If you power the redstone, all the pistons will try to extend, but only one (at random) will do it successfully, as all the heads try to go into the same space. The observers will detect which piston extended and send a pulse out.</p>\n<p>(I know I made it sound super complicated. Really, though, it’s simple.)</p>",
