A few ideas to achieve this without breaking the hunger system:</p>\n<p>1) The potion does not apply the benefits of saturation (like amplified regeneration)</p>\n<p>2a) The potion could strictly affect Lunge's exhaustion, and not affect other forms of hunger/exhaustion (sprinting, jumping, swimming, etc.)</p>\n<p>2b) The potion could minimize (rather than completely negating) all forms of exhaustion</p>\n<p>A potion with a \"really short duration\" misses the point. We already have an unstackable option to negate exhaustion for a few seconds (suspicious stew of saturation). We're missing an option to allow Lunge for more than a few seconds.</p>",

It will cause people to either need to pick up more weapons on them, adding to inventory clutter; or they'll just not use the spear in the first place.<br><br>If lunge replaced the charge attack, you could use the normal jab attack, finish them off with the lunge, or do some variety of both. It would create a situation where you would want two different kinds of spears: ones intended to be used for jousting and ones effectively used on foot.&nbsp;</p>",

As it is, when on foot the charge attack acts as a sort of static defense, which is fine and can be useful. The Lunge attack on foot would be a more aggressive playstyle, where the spear is more dynamic. This way we would get the best of both worlds, and the only difference in playstyle to choose would be a more defensive one or offensive one, rather than cutting off a major mechanic entirely.</p>",

However, I think as they are now, Spears have a lot of potential and simply feel like they can't reach them with the way they're being treated right now. Without good game feel, the Spears will never feel fun to use, which I think is by far the most important part of a weapon's design. Just swinging around the thing should feel satisfying. As such, I hope this idea reaches the developers and is received well.</p>\n<p>I should also mention a quirk I forgot to mention in this rework: When <strong>charged up fully</strong>,&nbsp;the Spear should<strong> deal critical damage.&nbsp;</strong>It'd help to incentivize timing your attack well and making well-timed attacks feel like big meaty stabs, as they should.</p>",
