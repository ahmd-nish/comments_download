But in my opinion this goes against the values of the overworld, a safe place, free of corruption and terror. Down and the caves it's a different story, lines between the safe haven of the overworld blur with more sinister concepts like the deep dark, imagine if you found that on the surface, it would look completely out of place. And that is the same issue the pale garden faces today. The developers have talked about Minecraft being a ecosystem, things need to be in balance and the pale garden disrupts that.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From scientific point of view, (I know this is a video game) the leaves are grey, indicting a lack of chlorophyll which is used to harvest energy from the sun. Where would you expect to find a tree that is only used to harvesting low levels of light, down in a cave not on the surface. The warden makes perfect sense to put in a cave as it is creature that have evolved without light meaning that is relies on it's other senses. But the pale garden on the surface? Let's face it is a bit of an eyesore. I really like the line about the lush garden that failed. And if it's a cave biome it will also encourage players to actually go there for things other than building supplies. Like traveling through caverns or gathering ores. This will also encourage players to actually face the creaking especially if it spawns not matter what. It should be cave.</p>",

Server owners and staff should be responsible for moderating their own servers. They're the ones brunting the costs of maintaining the servers, and should be the ones to dictate how their server is run.</p>\n\n<p>3. Other players shouldn't be responsible for PARENTING children who wander into offensive communities, AND NEITHER SHOULD MOJANG. PARENTS should be the ones monitoring their children's activity on Minecraft servers. If PARENTS don't want their children meeting unsavory people with the Minecraft chat function, either allow an option to disable it, or give a warning sign if parental controls are turned on if it's a new server.</p>\n\n<p>For an actual suggestion to REPLACE chat reporting that coincides with the last point, add a \"quick chat\" function that can become the only method of communication for children via parental controls.</p>\n\n<p>Think Toontown Online's \"Speedchat\" function, where a menu of chat categories drop down to give prewritten phrases. For Minecraft, some of these phrases could be \"Hi there!\" \"I need {amount} {item}.\" \"I'm stuck!\" \"My coordinates are {x} {y} {z} in the {dimension}.\" \"HELP!\" </p>",

I'm hoping there's more renewable options, like cave spiders dropping cobweb (which gives mineshafts a unique reason to explore), or husks dropping sand! Now that the sonic attack deals less damage, the animation and cooldown needs to be faster so that the Warden can kill distracting mobs faster. Wardens should try to move a bit faster on liquids!</p>\n\n<p>Getting goat horns should be easier, right now it seems too difficult to make a goat ram something. Screaming goat spawn chance can be increased a bit.</p>\n\n<p>Still hoping for fireflies and birch forest changes. Ambience like fireflies and sound effects in the wild (like crickets, sea winds, rustling leaves, cave drips etc) is something that a lot of players wanted. Those new decorative blocks and changes to the birch forest is really good!</p>\n\n<p>I'm generally against the \"nature friendly\" excuse, that fireflies are poisonous to frogs (but magma cubes aren't). Just rename them to glowbugs, or just let them coexist without frogs eating them? I really wanted fireflies in bottles as light sources. Minecraft shouldn't be a PETA moral compass to teach kids that $h@rrks and @l1igators aren't bad, it's a survival game where you do what you need to do to survive. If you must use fantasy creatures, add creatures similar to them. Avoid adding too many humanoid and undead enemies; we can instead make bane of arthropods enchant useful.</p>",

Sure it's more frequent, but a little over a heart of damage per 2 seconds is so easy to counter I can basically ignore the stealth aspect. Being a veteran player, I was so excited to be able to have something to fear, as we were told it would \"make veteran players fear like it's their first night\". This change nerfs the warden so badly he's went from very exciting, to very disappointing after over a year of hype.</p>",

Using fortune on copper ore fixed this problem.</p>\n<p>B: Hopper Chains are increasingly difficult to make on Bedrock Edition due to iron farms being broken on the version. Fortuning Iron ore fixed this problem.</p>\n<p>C: It gave more uses to BOTH silk touch and fortune. Silk touch can now be used to get metal ores, and Fortune can now be used on overworld gold, iron, and copper ores.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>D: It made all ores the same while also keeping the aspect of having to smelt metal ores. Now, fortune and silk touch can be used the same across all ore blocks besides nether gold and ancient debris.</p>\n<p>E: You have to admit the Raw Iron texture is great, it looks like a boot :D</p>\n<p>You have a point, but the fact is that ore items are not as useful as they said they were. Nobody ever uses ore blocks for building except in underground/cave builds, so the fact that ore blocks are able to be placed is irrelevant. Also, why should it be easy to place metal ores, but not gemstone ones? Raw Ore items also do NOT need uses like amethyst does, as their only usage is to get the refined ingot. This would be like saying that pre-1.17 ores need more crafting recipes.</p>\n<p>The 21w14a snapshot was random, unexpected, and yet still delivered a great feature to the game. I hope to see more snapshots like it.</p>",
