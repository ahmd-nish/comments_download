I prefer to fight challenging mobs and survive in survival mode, creative takes away the combat part of the game, along with achievements, and makes it less of a game.</p>\n\n<p>In survival though, I and many players often find ourselves relying on wood and stone, again and again. The other building blocks are just too much of a hassle to obtain and renew in large amounts. Terraforming is difficult as well, as the common blocks (Dirt, Netherrack, End Stone) are very difficult or even impossible to renew.</p>\n\n<p>Instead of an enchantment, I think they should just increase the amount of building blocks you get on trades and barters, and add more farms and mob drops, like Husks dropping sand or clay.</p>\n\n<p>I've been testing out copper in 1.17, and again it has the same problem, even with Fortune, as it needs 9 ingots to craft one block. Renewability is ridiculously difficult: it takes 180 Drowned kills in Java, and 81 kills in Bedrock, just to get ONE copper block. It ended up being a niche block that cannot be used in survival in large amounts, again. So, no copper/steampunk themed base build in survival. For the weathering, I wish that it takes a longer time, in Bedrock edition I got fully oxidized blocks within just 35 Minecraft days or so.</p>",

The oceans don't add any real challenges except the Guardians but it is a rare find and the Guardians aren't really a challenge. I totally agree with the Barnacle being added it was such a good concept with a unique feature (pulling you under water and drowning you) features like these should be put into the game because it makes it more of a challenge and reason to go into the ocean. And yes there should be new biomes in the ocean. There is only like 4 all the same except the coral reefs and I think there should be a biome called the deep oceans with new mobs like the angler fish. Sorry for writing a lot I was just going to post something like this soon. Thanks for stealing my idea lol.</p>",
