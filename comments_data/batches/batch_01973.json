        "body": "<p>Feedback here is from the perspective of a Java player and resource pack artist who plays both Texture Update and Programmer Art styles:</p>\n<p>Starting with great praise: The new UI is finally professional and I love how it looks with the current panorama (I anticipate 1.21's panorama). The blur filter not only looks good, but adds some awesome resource pack potential with the shaders (thank you for that!).</p>\n<p>Next, my sole gripe: due to how you implemented the new textures, the background shows on packs like ProgArt and High Contrast even where they didn't before (such as right when you pause). This means that pausing in multiplayer immediately obstructs the action. I propose you have a separate texture for the in-game overlay, even if in practice it is identical to the in-menu texture so that there can be more flexibility in adding custom menu textures. Just two new files can significantly improve UI creativity and avoid reducing quality of life for ProgArt users.</p>\n<p>Finally, something hopeful: the use of the portal shader for the credits background makes the credits look seamless with the portal which is really awesome and makes me extremely happy to look at. It could be cool to have the portal feeling by adding a ripple transition or something similar to still make it feel like you're going through that portal to somewhere (as ungracefully switching to a dirt background sort of did).</p>\n<p>Overall, the update so far is exciting, and I hope tweaks like these can be added to make it stellar. &lt;3</p>",

        "body": "<p>I really like this change! However, I've been working on an UI resource pack for Minecraft for some time now and there is a small problem. Enderchest and barrel use the same texture as the normal chests. I would like them to have their own UI texture, like the Shulker Chest. These currently all use the \"generic_54\" texture, which could then be renamed to \"chest\" as it is only used by chests, double chests, redstone chests, chests in boats and minecarts. This would allow Resourcepacks devs to create a custom UI texture for Ender Chest and Barrel without them always using the same texture as the normal chests.<br>I would be really happy if this would become a feature of Minecraft in the near future :)</p>",

        "body": "<p>Honestly I hate all the new changes. I want proper buttons and options to bring back the dirt background and screen darkening when pausing. It's only on the programmer art pack which is a really lazy and bad way to integrate it. Also when loading into and exiting a world, the dirt background will disappear for a little and show the blurred panorama so it doesn't even work right. Add a \"old menu background\" option that makes it just like it used to be where you don't see the panorama at all unless you're in the main menu screen.</p>\n<p>Also, for the first time, there is now lag in the Java menu. It used to be that there would be like a few frames of lag when first booting up the game and then it would be perfectly smooth and lag free. Now that the panorama is visible, there's lag when clicking create new world or loading in or exiting or doing most things. Great parity feature, we now have Bedrock's laggy menus lol</p>\n<p>The new changes are fine for those that like it, just have proper options to change back the dirt background and screen darkening. Please I don't want to learn to mod just for this xD It never hurts to just add options</p>",

Gloves &amp; gauntlets should've been in awhile ago, 'cos we've been battling with unprotected arms since the Minecraft Epoch! Also they added the offhand slot, which is kind of awkwardly placed on its own. I'd like to see the rest of the row filled in :)<br><br>The backpack thing interests me. I don't see the need for inventory expansion (I think it's of a satisfactory size right now) BUT I do see a left-out explanation for why the player can hold 36 items. I've always imagined players wearing invisible backpacks. What I want to see is the 27-slot inventory done away with, then 4 tiers of backpacks which expand your inventory to the normal limit and beyond:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tier 0 (No packpack): 9-slot hotbar only</li>\n<li>Tier 1 (Wood Framed Pack): 9-slot hotbar + 9-slot inventory.</li>\n<li>Tier 2 (Woolen Knapsack):&nbsp; 9-slot hotbar + 18-slot inventory</li>\n<li>Tier 3 (Leather Backpack): 9-slot hotbar + 27-slot inventory</li>\n<li>Tier 4 (Ender Bag): 9-slot hotbar + 36-slot inventory</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Those materials 1-3 oughtn't be too hard to get.
