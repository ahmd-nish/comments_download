This would give the fishing rod a lot more use for those who don't fish with the combat or picking up items from far away. Focusing on item grabbing this would be awesome to pull items from a different platform in the end or from another side of a lava lake in the nether without the fear of having the item fall or get burnt. I think it should have a level 1 2 and 3. 1 being doubling the range for items only, 2 being for pulling items in all the way and pulling mobs farther, and finally 3 for pulling both mobs and items very far.</p>",
