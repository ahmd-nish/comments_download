It would be for boot, and it would have 4 level, each level increasing the damage you deal while decreasing the fall damage you take. So level 1 would have you deal the fall damage you would have normally taken to the mob/player you land on while reducing the fall damage you take by 1/4th. Level 2 would make you deal 2x the fall damage you would have taken to the mob/player and reduce the fall damage you receive by 2/4th. Level 3 would make you deal 3x fall damage and reduce fall damage you receive by 3/4th. And level 4 would have you dealing 3.5x the fall damage you would have normally taken to the mob or player you land on (I thought 4x would be broken) while making you take no fall damage yourself. Of course, there are also super rough number, probably quite unbalanced, so Majang would probably change the stats quite a lot during play testing and development. I think it would be a kind of fun and powerful, but gimmicky and impractical to use, addition.</p>",

Given it's a magical world I think it could be unique that below Y= -49 light values only go half as far, and a quarter as far below Y= -64, presumably where the \"Deep Dark\" could be. Now in that original concept, the darkness itself could cause damage, but I'd rather see spawning increase or at least the spawn cap for hostile mobs increase with depth, and as long as you can light up the areas with normal torches (all be it needing more) I think that will be fine and make room for new potions/enchantments or more use of night vision potions at least for deep exploration.&nbsp;</p>",
