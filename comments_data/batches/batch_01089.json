        "body": "<p>Nice idea! Here’s my suggestion how those 3 states would work and be expressed:</p>\n<p><strong>wander/follow state:</strong> The pet establishes home at bed the player set as respawn point/slept in and would keep that bed as home point. To set/change the home point the pet must be in <em>wander/follow state</em> <em>(and the bed must be in his range of 40 blocks)</em>. The pet would wander around his home point as you described. When the player walks off that 32 block radius, the pet would follow the player. And of course, if the player walks in that 32 blocks radius while the pet is following him, the pet starts to wander around.</p>\n<p><strong>sit state:</strong> To prevent the pet to follow the player, you would left click it to sit. So the pet basically waits for the player to return home.</p>\n<p>-&gt; that means, if the player lets the pet back home to go on an adventure and sets a new respawn point on journey <em>(at least 40 blocks away from home bed)</em>, the pet doesn’t change his home point. If the player sets a new respawn point within the 40 blocks radius while the pet is sitting, the pet establishes the new bed as home point as soon as he’s switched to <em>wander/follow state</em> giving the feeling he need to “discover” the new home.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So actually there would only be 2 states: the <em>wander/follow state</em> and the <em>sit state</em> which the player switches with left click.</p>\n<p>everything in short and less complicated:</p>\n<p><strong>- the pet establishes his home point at the players respawn point <em>(bed)</em> when it’s set within his range of 40 blocks.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>- 2 states:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>follow/wander state&nbsp;</strong><strong><br></strong><strong><em>(when the player is near the pet’s home point (distance &nbsp;≤ 32 blocks), the pet wanders around it. When the player is far from the pet’s home point (distance &gt; 32 blocks), the pet follows the player)<br></em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>sit state</strong></p>\n<p>this turned out quite long sorry… hope you like my suggestion :)</p>",

I suggest variants include the Depth creeper, which causes a Water Vacuum Implosion that pulls the player inward, dealing damage and completely draining their Oxygen bar without destroying blocks. Next is the Sunken, which fires sharp Coral Shards that inflict Slowness and a Bleeding effect from the jagged cuts. For forgotten underwater structures, the Brinager uses a Rusted Crossbow to shoot heavy bolts that apply high Mining Fatigue due to the waterlogged metal. Another key addition is the POISONBLAST FISH, a large, decayed Pufferfish variant found near volcanic vents. Instead of simply having a poisoned touch, this mob initiates a powerful Poison Blast when approached, releasing a massive cloud of toxins that inflicts Poison II and Weakness on the player, making it a critical threat to deep-sea explorers. Finally, the Clamber is a small, fast-moving threat in narrow underwater caves, whose bite inflicts both Poison and Nausea, making navigation in the dark depths extremely difficult. These mobs would ensure players are forced to rely on specialized diving and combat gear when venturing into the abyss.</p>",
