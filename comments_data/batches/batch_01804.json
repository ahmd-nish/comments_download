Rubies would be really rare (also because it would be difficult to mine them from under the sea), I think that inside the ocean monument instead of gold there must be blocks of rubies, to make the loot more important, also because now we find a lot of gold in the nether ! And illagers would drop rubies instead of emeralds. In short, like the illagers who are the out cast of the villagers, the rubies would also be the out cast of the emeralds. Adding rubies to minecraft would be really cool especially for veterans of the game! (illagers should have red eyes, like villagers have green eyes)</p>",

Maybe it could just be made of cobblestone and moss stone? Unfortunately, there's no way for the structure to end specifically next to a river, but the structure could be built in such a way that wherever it <em>does </em>exit, it would have water flowing out.</p>\n<p>I doubt that Mojang would implement rats and bats as hostile mobs. Maybe just regular bats for ambience along with Giant Rats that could be neutral? Or even Drowned could spawn in the sewers and their design would suit the environment well!</p>\n<p>Now for poison water, it's tricky to come up with new fluids that work because they have to be able to interact with water and lava in some way. So maybe when poison water comes into contact with regular water, it <em>becomes </em>regular water, like it's being diluted. And since poison water is just a form of water, it would act as such in contact with lava, forming obsidian, stone, or cobblestone, depending on how they touch.</p>",
