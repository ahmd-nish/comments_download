Wireless Redstone is already crazy enough, and it should be expensive. Having to go down to the depths to fight the deadly Warden should be enough of a sacrifice to boost the value exponentially. Killing the Warden, on the other hand, and having it drop a rare item is fair. A goal I have is to automate everything. While I don't think automation is bad, too much automation is. This is the issue I have: I feel there should be a reason to go down to the depths more. As implied earlier, Skulks should be hard to get.&nbsp;<br>I will say one thing: I am not against farmable Wardens. I do have a solution to combat this though, and I believe this solution is mutual.<br><br>Possible solutions I came up with are:</p>\n<p>1. The Seed from Warden should grow into limited Skulkers. What I mean is while you can get one-or a couple-of Skulker Sensors from one seed. The grown Skulkers will not produce seeds, and you have to go back to kill more Wardens for more seeds.<br><br>2. Skulkers should only be farmable on their native block, keeping you coming down to the mine, like the geodes already in the cave update.&nbsp;<br><br>3. Skulker seeds shouldn't grow the block, but as you said, \"something required to craft the skulk sensor\". Once it grows, and you harvest it (whether it be automatic or manual), &nbsp;<em><strong>the other resources should not be farmable</strong></em>, sort of like naturally generating ores like diamonds or lapis lazuli.</p>",

This is because netherite is already made with gold and other stages of the game often pass too quickly for upgrading tools to be worthwhile.<br><br>Second: You said \"combine a tool with gold in a smithing table to increase durability\". This is illogical since gold tools have low durability.</p>\n<p>Third: To make this make more sense, gilded tools should in my opinion have a durability somewhere between that of a netherite and gold tool. Because this is a drawback, gilded tools would also get better enchants since gold tools do that in game.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: Using a gold ingot with a netherite tool in a smithing table should gild it, making the tool have a gold color name and a different texture.</strong></p>\n<p><strong> A gilded tool would have lower durability&nbsp;<em>BUT </em>it would have increased mining speed and it would be easier to enchant. <em>Gilding tools multiple times could make the tool more gilded and restore its durability. But... be carefull! gilding a tool too much will make it into a gold tool.</em></strong></p>",
