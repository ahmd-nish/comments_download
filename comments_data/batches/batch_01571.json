I feel like them stealing items is a little too frustrating, but perhaps them hitting you for half a heart might make sense, mostly for the knocking factor of getting hit. Its not a huge drawback but it is harmfull and if your near lave, its has potential to kill, but it might not happen often. Seeing this is a nether mob it might be cool to tame them with a golden apple or something. I do like the idea of them being tricksters though so im not sure how that could be kept if you get rid of theft. Perhaps instead its just easier to get your stuff back, maybe by cornering them they throw it back?</p>",
