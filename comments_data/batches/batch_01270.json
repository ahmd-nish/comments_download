It is decribed as,, After not taking damage for 10 seconds you will regenerate 0,8% of max health pre second (tier 1), 1% of max health per second (tier 2) and 1,2% of max health per second (tier 3)\". If you modded this Enchant in the game it aktually works, after not taking damage you will aktually regenerate, the issue however is that this is bugged, Instead of healing 0,8%/1%/1,2% of the max health, it literarly regenerates 1 health point per second, eighter this is intended or it is bugged. I tried reporting it on the bug report site of Minecraft Dungeons but some developer just say ,,you normaly can only acess this enchant with third party tools, your issue is invalid\". My suggestion would be that The developers add this enchantment to the game and fix the current bug with it. I mean we have ,,Explorer\" an Enchantment that kinda does the same thing, It heals you for going on through the mission basically exploring. The healing of explorer is 1% of max health on tier 3. 1% Of max health is not that much and it isn't OP is is Ok I guess. So why can't we have a enchantment that heals you for basically just standing still and not taking damage.&nbsp;</p>",

He was smarter, bigger, better, and don't forget - A King! The Creep King heard of new islands appearing in a place called the island realm. He went there, to find an island that had no signs of civilization on it. It had a perfect beach for relaxing, a perfect forest for a park, and a huge mountain that looked like it would be a perfect place for a palace. The Creep King wanted to make a paradise for creepers, so they wouldn't have to worry about having to kill anybody.</p>\n<p>According to the shard tracker, it says that the next shard is located on an island of sorts. An island with creepers. Great... Anyway, you sail onto the beach, only to be greeted by normal creepers, but I guess the Creep King wanted a variety of Creepers on his island. So now there are elemental Creepers. Yay... It will only get worse from here.</p>\n<p>As you come from the beach you walk into a forest. Actually... it's a park inside a forest. You follow the paths to reach the beginning of the mountain hike you're going to have to make.</p>\n<p>On your hike, things get harder and harder, and then you reach the palace. Fight through the guards to get to the throne room. Then you battle The Creep King. If he explodes once, everybody dies. There's a pile of TNT in the room below. After you defeat him, you can head back home.</p>\n<p>Or...</p>\n<p>Head to Creeperville. The city is home to many friendly Creepers.</p>",
