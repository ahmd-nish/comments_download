This is a good path for the future (note that I don't disagree with the kill drop thing in general, I wouldn't change cows sheep and pigs for the world, and I want pretty much all monsters to drop something).</p>\n<p>Possible uses:</p>\n<p>In real life people will often dehorn a rhino to prevent them from being poached, the horn grows back in about 3 years. I know this is may not be the kind of thing we want to raise awareness, but it would be interesting if you could shear its horn of when its a baby and then it regrows when it comes an adult. This would encourage breeding. You cannot shear it as an adult.</p>\n<p>Another option would be to have it occasionally dig something unique out of the ground, this would be great because it would teach people that rhinos are more than we often assume.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would also suggest that we use black rhinos, also an endangered species, but there's a 2 in 100 chance of a white one, making them even more exciting.</p>",
