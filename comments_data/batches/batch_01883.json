The first is that the device would be directional, like the comparator. When the device is powered from the back, it will emit a pulse from the front. The length of the pulse it emits will be based on the signal entering one of it's sides, this is similar to how the calibrated sculk sensor is calibrated. For example if the signal strength is one, it will emit one tick. This may be similar to your own idea, but the way I understood yours is that is sounded like a clock, not a pulse extender.</p>",

This observatory would generate in a mini biome of some sort, maybe in a biome variant of the badlands. I feel this would fit the vibe and also makes sense as there is a lot of open sky. Another thing to consider is that the event would only take place within proximity of the structure. This would stop one player's actions from affecting the entire world as possibly disrupting other players. The idea behind the ominous potion is to </span><strong>choose</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to make things harder and since it’s an ominous event it would actually need to be a challenge as well. Now, we need to incentivize finding this rare structure. I'm thinking a drop of some kind. A quick idea I thought of is to have the critters drop fireballs. This would be a throwable item that functions like a ghast fireball or the fireballs from Hypixel Bed wars. Fireballs are very fun and this would be a way to add them to Minecraft. Due to the size of this proposal, this would make a great game-drop idea and would be able to be developed and implemented quickly. If you want to see this is a idea added to Minecraft vote up this post and comment. Or feel free to add to the idea and comment below.</span></p>",

I think it would be really cool if there was a new type of fungi that grew on the trees and would only germinate at night.
