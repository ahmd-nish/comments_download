Simply disable achievements for that world.&nbsp; That removes about 95% of the challenges that doing this faces.&nbsp; The rest could potentially be made entirely out of F# which has the ability to speak with C++ and Java.</p>\n<p>This definitely should have happened a long time ago, and not only for the benefit of Microsoft, but also to benefit the people who have made Minecraft so popular over the years, the modding community, a small way in which Microsoft can pay them back without actually paying them back, even though, it's clear that many mods have created millions of new user accounts from their offerings and it's likely that the mod makers have driven more people to buy Minecraft than any other marketing source.&nbsp; So, well, they kinda owe it to the modders to let 'em have their stuff on Bedrock as well as Java, so players, and families who play together, can be able to experience a true modded crossplay server experience.</p>\n<p>Finally, it will also add educational benefits and create ways to teach people about complex technologies and resource management. I'd love to show my kids Mekanism for it's educational value, but they prefer their Xbox and Phone for Minecraft, rather than mouse and keyboard on a PC.</p>",
