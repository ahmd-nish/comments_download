It would be cool if the wetland biome was one you could grow and nurture from a small area and get it to expand by looking after it. This could be done by letting the peat spread onto mud blocks next to it at a similar pace to the oxidation of copper. This would be a great way to raise awareness for the value of peat habitats in stopping climate change, while adding a new fun way to play the game. If the player expands the biome more mobs should start to spawn in the wetland and the water in the biome if moved somewhere else could make crops and other plants grow faster because of all the nutrients in it. Developing peat could have the same property as powdered snow letting the player move through it but if something dies in it then it could leave bonemeal instead of its regular drop.</p>",

I have some suggestions to polish the idea.</p>\n<p>Purpur blocks are made of chorus fruit (eating it makes you teleport). The portal could be made of purpur blocks in a ring on the ground. Throwing an ender eye above the portal could cause it to fly in and activate it. The inner dimension should have a linked portal made of bedrock, like the dragon fountain in the end. The dimension could be a flat, floating end island with a blackish skybox, similar to the end. No creepy, glitchy music - just silence. It is just for building a secret base.</p>\n<p>I don't really think this should be a private dimension though - just a secret one. The portal should link to a dimension that was created for the player that activated it. Each of that player's portals should link to the same personal dimension, same island, same bedrock landing pad. When they exit the dimension they should teleport to the oldest, still active portal that was created by them. This provides an almost instant method of 1 way teleportation.</p>\n<p>There should be one dimension per player and they can be accessed by any portal that was activated by that player. Players are free to visit other player's portals and their linked dimensions. If a griefer deactivates the last portal, players inside will teleport back to that location by default anyway. If a griefer reactivates a portal, it links to their own dimension. Thus dimensions can be protected by a player by just deactivating them. If that doesn't work, just have have the current chunk determine which dimension a portal links to.</p>",

This can disorientate the player but also help them frantically escape the creaking (if they are buffed or swarmed). An interesting story telling structure within the garden such as a fountain made of end bricks, perhaps alludes to the idea that these 'rifts' within the trees reflect a weakened overworld stability in this biome and are connected to the end dimension. This gives reasoning also for its pale tone, as if its life is being absorbed by these rifts.</p>\n<p>(raising the canopy height will allow for thicker trailing vines to help them look more alike weeping willow trees, and also grants creativity for the shape of the openings within some trunks).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This makes the biome extremely unique, fits within the disorienting nature of the sound affects, and brings a unique way of countering being swarmed by the creaking (allows them to have a buff). It also allows them to be given a useful drop to create a strong reason to collect the heart as a spawner. With the creaking &amp; rift (chorus) teleportation, in its own right is already a fun challenge to dart around trying to draw the mobs away for you to get closer to the heart.</p>\n<p>edit: also makes sense why the creaking look like they do (similar to the enderman) if the end dimesnsion is disrupting this biome and morphing its mobs</p>",
