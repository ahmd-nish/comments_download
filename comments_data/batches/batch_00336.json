Jade tools were really durable but also weak since it couldn't be made too sharp, so maybe tools with high durability, decent speed and low damage?</p>\n<p>Opal should have more uses too. Maybe something related to water like a necklace or a magical item that helps somehow? Even decorative blocks would be great.</p>\n<p>Finally ruby... Honestly I'd like to see it in Minecraft but I don't know how it could be useful. Cheap tradings seems unnecessary and gear like everyone says would be kinda useless and easily skippable.
