Secondly it would remove forgotten air bubbles in shipwrecks with generated door, and make them more esthetic. It would finally finish to extand build possibilities on Java, mostly on all underwater themed builds (which are common !).</p>\n\n<p>How ? Two options :\n<br />1) By making the tag supported by the following blocks, which would get as well their model with water. (Not exhaustive list) :\n<br />- bed\n<br />- anvil\n<br />- rail\n<br />- carpet ?\n<br />- plants ? (Grass, flower, bamboo, leaves) --&gt; See impact for farms.\n<br />- fence gates\n<br />- etc.</p>\n\n<p>2) by finishing what Jeb started working on if it hasn't been trashed : making fluids working separately from blocks, allowing easy support for a wide range of blocks including the list below, and would as well allow the same support for lava or snow (it's not a fluid but bedrock support snow in plants for example) This could be extended to bedrock. This may ask a lot of work but it has already been extended greatly, and this could be done aside from the main theme as it is done for tagia.</p>\n\n<p>This should for sure be considered, and would make happy a lot of builders (when Jeb presented water in leaves, trust me around me it made noise.)\n<br />If you're a player and agree with this comment, please consider voting, to show your support and your interest!</p>",

These buffs could include damage boost, speed boost, water breathing, invisibility etc... Each buff would be accompanied by a debuff or downside: IE the invisibility buff could only happen for ten seconds af a time every minute or the damage boost decreases your defense. The totems would be rare boss drops. This could tie into a future cave/dungeon update where dungeon's are more frequent and resemble that of an instance in dungeon crawling games where you fight your way to a main boss.</p>",

When throwing it tt's less powerful than a fully enchanted bow and when using left clicking its less powerful than a fully enchanted sword. This makes it practically useless in many combat situations. I think adding either a unique enchantment or ability to add an extra edge would make more of a place for it in combat, making combat more interesting. It has channeling and riptide but those only work in rain, making it inconsistent, so its not worth an inventory slot.</p>\n<p>I think that adding more reach when using a trident would add this extra edge. It wouldn't be much, but &nbsp;it would go with the whole idea of a trident's shape lengthwise, almost as if it were a spear. I would balance this with a longer delay between swings or two types of melee attacks with a trident, a basic one and a lunge, the latter having increased damage and an increased range with the cost of a longer recharge and maybe it moved you forward more.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Basically add another use to the trident and balance it.</p>",

Crafting recipe would be: 1 diamond block, one iron block, one emerald block, one gold block, one redstone block, one coal block, one lapislazuli block, one quarz block. In the center could be something more expensive, like a netherstar. If the player places the named rainbow block, the 16*16 area (1 chunk) that this rainbow block is placed in, is claimed. It can not be placed into chunks that already have been claimed. This block would be the only block that CAN be destroyed by other players, so the owner of the block has to protect it by building other blocks around it. If destroyed (creeper explosion, tnt, other) or harvested, a regular unnamed rainbow block is dropped, and the claim is revoked. If the named rainbow block is dropped, it looses its naming, and instead a regular, unnamed rainbow is dropped. They can not be used inside an area of +-1000 blocks around the spawn (this would discourage new players). This \"claim-free\" area width could be defined by a command. A player can craft and place/claim as much as 16 named rainbow blocks by standard. There could be a server command to re-define this amount. On re-definition with a value lower than the previous value, all claimed chunks are unclaimed, and all existant placed named diamond blocks become regular diamond blocks. The players will have to re-claim their territory after such a re-definition.</p>\n<p>The recipe of such a block would be found in a book in dungeons, as described in following post:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360043516552-Unlock-recipes-one-by-one\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360043516552-Unlock-recipes-one-by-one</a></p>\n<p>The effect of this protection would be a minecraft secret.
