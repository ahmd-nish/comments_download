That should be expanded to more scenarios.</p>\n<p><br>In snowy regions you would have a very slowed freezing effect. During the day you would slowly freeze for 5 minutes then take damage. At night you would take damage after 3 minutes. Leather armor would negate this as well as standing within melting distance of torches, lava, campfires, ect.<br><br>In desert regions you would have a very slowed dehydration effect. During the day you would slowly thirst for 5 minutes, then take damage the same speed as freezing. Drinking a water bottle would reset the timer as well as jumping in water giving a purpose to desert wells. (Water bottles would be stackable) At night you would cool off. This rule would also apply to the nether.</p>",

The first time I came across this bug was with trees and I thought it was a new feature! I think that leaves should stay solid but you should be able to walk through leaves one block off the ground. It feels really natural to just walk through the leaves and is very convenient when going through forests or tree farming. It would take away the need to break leaves on the bottom of the tree which, in my opinion, is not something that would be missed.</p>",
