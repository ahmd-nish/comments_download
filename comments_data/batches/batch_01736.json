Those dedicated enough to fill out several maps' worth of blocks could make the display switch between different words or numbers by swapping out maps with a bit of redstone.</p>",

This means instead of having to depend on red stone ticks, there can be a completely separate note-tick that happens at 600Hz.</p>\n<p>In fact, the propagation of note-event on note-ticks can use logic very similar to chaining command blocks. Just like chaining command blocks, note blocks can only trigger one adjacent note block (the one they face towards). However, this triggering will happen at 600Hz on a separate note-thread.</p>\n<p>Then, a special setting in the note block, like activation delay, can be used to set a custom delay before each note is played. This will allow custom pacing in your song.</p>",

If a separate thread is used for these note-events, then they will need to be processed consistently at the correct time intervals. The real problem arises when this note-event thread needs to keep in sync with the Minecraft world. Changes to the Minecraft world can cause changes to what notes are played and thus the note-event thread can not pre-load the notes required to play since the Minecraft world can change.</p>\n<p>One workaround optimization to this would be to calculate how many note blocks can be played on each tick. Since the world can be changed only on a game tick, all notes that can be played in the current tick can be bulk-loaded and played.</p>\n<p>The bulk-loading of notes to play in the current tick however is also a concern for optimization since at 600Hz, querying each Minecraft block to find the graph of note blocks to play can be expensive. Also, the bulk-loaded data can only contain notes that will play within the current tick since notes to be played later can change due to changes in the world.</p>\n<p>In fact, due to the strict coupling with the Minecraft world, the note-event thread will need to be strictly in-sync with the game tick thread since we cannot skip any note block playback. If there is any delay in the note playback, the game tick thread will need to be delayed to keep in sync with the note-event thread.</p>",

It would be easy to basically copy the code and change the color. If you've actually some how worked on the game and know how its lighting engine works then please prove me wrong.<br><br><br>Also, I can agree with that a bit, and can even add a recipe change to make it interesting and nether looking. And it can be fixed and unique like Gong Bo-Lin said in his positive comment, \"&nbsp;I think you can add a fixed repeater to make up for the problem that the original repeater can only transmit in one direction. This can make it more convenient to make multiple control switches when the repeaters are side by side !\" which imo is a perfect fix.<br><br><br>So now that it can be made not a \"one-block solution\" I don't really mind that part, though I do wanna mention that even if there was no repeaters the torch itself would be an idea players would think of through-out the years, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that there is no soul variant of a redstone torch. So even without repeaters or whatever there is alot to this that isn't \"one-block solutions\".</p>",

Since all blocks are acceptable note block inputs, requiring a note from a noteblock on the same block means that it wouldn't receive any signals but explicitly designed ones, removing their utility for the Warden. Perhaps, instead allow the skulk sensor to be placed on top of or on the side of a noteblock or jukebox. With the skulk sensor affixed in such a manner, then we could apply either a global requirement of only noteblocks notes or usage of jukeboxes. Because this kind of placement cannot naturally occur, it wouldn't interfere with normal skulk sensor functionality.</p>\n<p>In keeping with the Minecraft theme of simplistic interconnected aspects that apply both a universal functionality, a specific functionality, and occasionally a humorous or quirky addition, the skulk sensor wouldn't be strange for having either a crafting recipe, redstone interaction, or thematic interaction with either the noteblock, the jukebox, or both. It is probably more in alignment with the Minecraft theme for noteblocks to have a useful interaction, and for the jukebox to have a silly interaction, or vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Another idea is that, as opposed to wool blocks which stop all sensing in a direction, the noteblock(or jukebox) could selectively allow only skulk particles from specific sources to be read from that direction, such as tuning or activating a noteblock. Alternatively, placeing a skulk sensor on a noteblock could change the note.</p>",

We have a similar idea, from my post. Add gold iron and copper tuning forks to wireless activate the sculker sensors behind walls, or other materials aside from wool.&nbsp; Red stone would not be entirely wireless unless their was a way to activate the block wireless. That is where tuning forks come in. The different tuning forks would activate a different frequency range of sound, and would be able to wireless activate a sculk sensor of the same frequency range. Based on real life tuning forks being made out of different material. These could be use in sequences to open hidden doors in different orders, and would be great for map makers. The red stone can be hidden behind the walls with no buttons levers or external activation devices thus allowing for creative contraptions to happen behind the scenes. The tuning block and activated with right click or placed with left click. When lightning hits a tuning fork it makes a sound. Placing it a top a lighting rod would allow you to trigger red stone with the strikes of lighting. I think leaving the sensors very open and uncontrolled and then adding systems in game to give meaning to old items and harness the block for a specific purpose is better then just making it limited to begin with.</p>",
