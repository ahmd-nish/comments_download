        "body": "<p>What about giving the expression *I'm out for blood\" a new in-game meaning? Maybe we go deep in the caves for some bottles of Warden's blood, like literally. Each time we hit him with a sword or axe he starts to bleed, then we have to hit him with a empty bottle to collect his blood. The wound would be open only for a short while, then heals up and we'd have to hit him again, until eventually killing him. His blood could be some shade of blue or green and could be the base ingredient for a whole new line of potions or at least a new one that gives us both strength and resistance II and could be increased to level III or extended in time. That means an eight minutes potion of strength II and resistance II at the same time. Or both for short time but a level III.<br><br>But this next one I believe it's far better. Mob spawners are nothing but cages, right? Warden are supposed to have the authority to lock people up but also set them free (I know, not exactly like that, but still, the basic). So what about the Warden drops a key to \"open\" and move mob spawners, or the itens to make them like special iron bars, enchanted ones.<br>I think I'm gonna suggest that myself.</p>",

Plains/Beach = summer. any snow biome = Winter. Cherry Grove = spring. But we dont have any for autumn. So i was thinking what if there was a new biome? maybe called something like Maple Forest. It will have orange leaved trees like the leaves in autumn. There will be a falling leaves particle that spawn under the leaves. I feel like it would be a good idea if there were leaf piles and once you right click or break them you either get loot (maybe a biome exclusive item) or a mob could jump out? It would also be cool if you could make them yourself and hide items in them.</p>\n<p>Another thought I had is that this idea could be a good way to introduce a mob like squirrels to minecraft! because I feel like rummaging through leaf piles and finding acorns could be cool and could also be used to tame or breed the squirrels. Like bees with their bee hives, I feel like it could be cool if, in some of the trees, one of the logs has a hole and thats where the squirrels go at night. If you break the log with a hole in it i'd imagine you just get a normal log (and if there are squirrels inside when the log is broken they would get kicked out like bees do) but the player would also be able to craft a man-made home for the squirrels</p>",

Personally I think iron should be less easy to find underground and that you should only be able to smelt ores in the blast furnace because in real life you need very high temperatures to smelt most ores.</p>",

And I like the idea that Bronze can be used for some sort of tool, maybe not complete set of tools and armor.

Copper would be used for bronze, and also weak copper tools if you're desperate so it doesn't feel so useless, like how goats do. Copper could also be used for any future redstone implements, maybe electricity for wireless red stone, or a way to make redstone smaller.</p>\n<p>Bronze can be used to make springs, which can be used to heal and build golems (which are now a reasonable thing to actually make, I don't know how they'd balance that but nobody ever uses iron golems as far as I know.) Bronze can be used to make submarines and improved boats. Maybe the FTB paxel. Bronze is also now necessary to make lamps, and it can be used to make mirrored glass (for city builds, very useful)</p>\n<p>So better tools, musical instruments, music discs, submarines, boats, springs for golems, mirrors.</p>",

Maybe you could get one as a reward in a woodland mansion? I think the amount of horses you use on the wagon should vary the speed! For example, if you only have one horse, the wagon can only go at a fair speed, but with two horses they should be able to run and the wagon should be able to go fast if you press some kind of button that shows up on your screen or some kind of key on a keyboard. I personally think three horses is too many.</p>\n<p>You could also use the wagon to keep horses tied up while you do something else.</p>\n<p>However, I'm a bit worried about this idea. Since Mojang wouldn't include sharks ingame, I'm not sure about horse-drawn wagons because using horses to pull a cart is labour, and I don't know if they'd want to encourage kids this.
