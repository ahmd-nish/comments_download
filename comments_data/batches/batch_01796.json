It would be great for pvp, and for minigames.</p>\n<p>This would also fit fairly well with the new mechanics. I guess not in the sense of rehydrating the ghast, but certainly in the sense of dumping a liquid on the dried ghast. It would be very cool, if the newly born grumpy ghasts were now rideable as well. They would be just a little less friendly than their happy counterparts, but you could still saddle and ride them. These player created grumpy ghasts should still shoot fireballs at players. However, I think that when a player is riding the ghast, it should stop shooting fireballs of its own accord. The player riding the ghast can then direct the ghast to shoot fireballs if the player so chooses. Additionally, having a different saddle than the happy ghast would alert nearby players of the coming danger. The 'grumpy ghast' or whatever it should be called is still different than the nether ghasts, who are always hostile and unrideable. All ghast types should have the standing on functionality as well.</p>\n<p>Anyway, those are just my thoughts. I love the general idea and I hope it gains traction.&nbsp;</p>",
