Like I said, it doesn't need to be perfect. People can get around filters without much trouble, and there's always ways to make it better, but a basic filter would be nice.</p>\n<p>As for the moral obligation, this is a classic problem seen in what feels like every game. While it is something that parents need to be careful of, there should be settings for basic things like profanity filtering. Does it need to be there when the game first launches? No. Would it be nice to have later down the road? Yep! Basically just go for the low hanging fruit. Disable blood? Blur nudity? Prevent players from sabotaging someone else? Cyber bullying? Some are easier than others to do, some are a piece of cake. Profanity filtering is one of the easy ones.</p>",
