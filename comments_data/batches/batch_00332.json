I have seen dandelions growing under top snow in snowy biomes, so I think they could be used to craft a tea that gives a temporary effect protecting against or healing cold damage. That way it gives the tea a useful reason to exist besides being purely aesthetic (though I would be happy with that too).</p>\n<p>Dandelion tea is already a real drink, and it could be crafted using a bottle of water, honey (maybe), and a roasted dandelion (maybe you need to put the dandelion in the smoker/furnace first). This also makes it so no new plants need to be added to the game. I think a tea kettle and a teacup would be fun additions as well, maybe crafted from clay bricks like flowerpots or iron ingots.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Instead of posting a new idea, I'd like to add onto this, as I also thought adding tea would be a great idea. Tea would be harvested from some kind of tea plant as tea leaves, and could have many applications.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Potions: Tea leaves could be a potion ingredient. For example, Chamomile tea could be added, which allows the player to sleep during the day (useful if you need to skip to night). Caffeinated tea could possibly prevent phantoms from spawning that night (if you can't sleep or need it to be night). It could also be used for some kind of speed boost or other effect.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Food item: Chai tea with milk and honey is one of my favorite teas, and because milk and honey already exist in game (as well as water) it makes the recipe easy to add. It would be a basic food item, though it could also possibly give one of the effects listed above if it isn't added as a potion ingredient.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Other: Tea has many other properties, such as for calming someone or as a medicine. This could be a great opportunity for Minecraft to teach players about tea use around the world, which I know has been a thing with a lot of the newer features added. I also really love boba tea, a tea drink with tapioca pearls at the bottom that are eaten with the drink, though I haven't thought of how they could be added to the game and be useful. Thought I'd mention them at least.</p>\n<p>Feel free to let me know if you think of other uses for tea, and I'm glad that other people have thought of this idea as well!</p>",
