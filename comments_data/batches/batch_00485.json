I love this idea! I think Mojang would take interest in this, but they may for-go the mob warding feature. It feels a bit too mystical for vanilla. I would love to see it added as a way to manipulate mob pathing even further, I just don’t know if Mojang would want to add it to vanilla. </p>\n\n<p>One more idea for salt I just thought of - why not allow it to be used to “cure” rotten flesh into leather?

This would involve these \"flares\" being entities and emitting light, which Mojang hasn't done before, but with Glow Squids confirmed and set to be released, this shouldn't be an issue...?</p>",

        "body": "<p>The addition of torch arrows to Minecraft can be seen as a response to player needs for more dynamic and versatile tools for exploration and combat. Here are several reasons why torch arrows were introduced:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Illumination from a Distance</strong>: Torches are a fundamental tool in Minecraft for lighting up dark areas to prevent hostile mob spawns and to see clearly. Torch arrows allow players to light up areas from a distance, which is particularly useful in deep caves or ravines where it's risky to approach closely.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Exploration Efficiency</strong>: When exploring new terrains or cave systems, players can use torch arrows to mark paths, highlight points of interest, or light up distant targets without needing to traverse dangerous or difficult terrain immediately. This makes exploration faster and safer.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Strategic Combat</strong>: In combat scenarios, especially against mobs that spawn in the dark, torch arrows offer a way to strategically light up areas to reduce mob spawns while still engaging in combat. This can be especially useful in situations where placing torches by hand would be too slow or dangerous.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Gameplay Mechanics</strong>: Adding new items like torch arrows introduces fresh gameplay mechanics and strategies. It encourages players to think creatively about how they explore, combat, and interact with the Minecraft world, keeping the game experience engaging and varied.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>",

It makes walls. They could be labeled as something like \"dirt mound\" and \"dirt step\". Someone commented that MC doesn't need more resolution. It's not an argument of resolution, it's an argument for the general creativity that wouldn't drastically effect anything. Don't like it? Don't use it. Thing is with something like a dirt slab or stair, you could have some lovely Terraforming. I don't necessarily think it should be incorporated in world generation so much, but definitely something manmade. You could change the gradient change of a Prairie to be more gradual. Or have more flowing hills as you approach your base. As you develop the are around your base you could slowly add and change the lands around to flow better. It'd be a nice change instead of having to slam the spacebar the entire time while wondering around your world. </p>",

Horse armor is the only armor that you cannot enchant.. nor has a netherite upgrade (from diamond). Not only would it let horse PVP be an option, it would greatly improve in game battles as well (ex: Villager Raids)</p>\n<p>I think keeping in a bastion is a cool choice.. however i think having it be craftable from diamonds with a smithing table should also be an option.</p>\n<p>I think adding Frost Walker as an enchantment would benefit greatly as well. Though personally i think they should just have horses be able to swim. I mean you wouldn't think it, but horses are in fact really great swimmers! They have a natural instinct (like most animals) to start swimming once they hit deep water, plus huge lungs that keep them buoyant.</p>",

But kinda like how fences connect to blocks near by, the leaves would connect to the trunk when next to it. So it would be top of trunk in middle block, and on 4 blocks surrounding, it would be leaves. And maybe the top trunk that is connected to the leaves would look different too.  And like doors, the leaves would extend more then one block space.  And maybe you could use the leaves for something too. Id looooove palm trees. Palm tree is my favorite tree. Maybe you could make a block from palm tree leaves and make a structure!  Maybe you could stack palm tree leaves into one soace when you place them? Less essential.  I really want palm trees.</p>",
