Another idea is that dispensers will always extend fully, but if the rope reaches the ground it will create a coiled rope block which gets higher the more rope is in it.</p>",

Should conflict with both curses and Mending - no penalties should be needed because the fact that it conflicts with the curses would make it appear less often, and the fact that you cannot apply mending means it would break eventually. If it's still too strong, maybe it could conflict with unbreaking, though that wouldn't be ideal. I actually had this idea as well - good thing I searched to see if there was another one.</p>\n<p>Another idea is maybe instead of just being&nbsp;<em>soulbound</em> it has 3 levels:</p>\n<p><em>Soulbound I</em> would have a 60% chance to keep affected item upon death</p>\n<p><em>Soulbound II</em> would have an 80% chance to keep affected item upon death</p>\n<p><em>Soulbound III</em> would have a 100% chance to keep affected item upon death. Possibly only be obtainable if you combined two level 2 soulbound enchants.</p>\n<p>I could see this enchant seeing a&nbsp;<em>ton</em> of use in map making, especially if there were 3 levels.</p>",

Mojang doesnt want players to just use an enchantment and get permanent protection from wardens, they want us to think of strategies to avoid it or methods of fighting it. I believe that this enchantment would make the warden useless.</p>",

Im not sure where other players stand on this issue, but I think it might be time to see a change in Mojang leadership, someone who cares about not just the game, but about its fanbase too, and who will listen to the playerbase and fix these annoying discrepancies.
