But since you need a very high temperature furnace to smelt iron, why not make the blast furnace be necessary to smelt iron (and because it needs the high temperature, it takes the full 10 seconds to smelt like in a regular furnace), and then have the crafting recipe for the blast furnace require either iron ingots OR bronze ingots to be created. This way, the metals and how they were used reflect their actual properties and historical practise, there’s a clear developmental process reminiscent of the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, and while similar to iron, bronze functions as more than just a cosmetic reskin of iron, give or take a bit of damage/hardness/etc.<br><br>Note: that’s just an idea, and if we were to implement it as well we’d need to change up iron farms (probably by turning all the iron ingots drops into iron ore block drops or something, and zombies rarely dropping iron nuggets instead of ingots), but I think this adds copper, tin and bronze accurately in a way that makes sense and makes them a significant step, but without deviating too much from the natural progression of the game. Also it maks iron ore a good learning tool for new players, encouraging players to keep the ore until it shortly becomes very useful</p>",

The idea of having it spawn more frequently in some biomes is definitely something I agree with. As a suggestion, I would go with mountains, which are already being updated and which seem like the right kind of place to find it. The crying tin block is a nice idea, and the bronze is definite, but there should also be another use or two of it. Additionally, it could have a cut variant similar to copper, to allow for players to have tin roofs and such. As for the bronze alloy, I would suggest a new utility block for the purpose of making alloys, an alloy furnace. It would be crafted with iron (or bronze) on top and bottom, with the middle row being Blast Furnace, Hopper, Blast Furnace, making it the intense heating of two metals that are then combined.

Bronze during the Ancient Greek times was used a lot in armor and weaponry, especially spears and shield. So this is a great time to add spear made 3 diagonal ingots. And to make a bronze shield why not use the smithing table (the same thing to make netherite things). This will give more use to the block, since at the current moment it has little use. Bronze and Tin blocks will give us more building items. Also, Tins properties halt corrosion so maybe it can act like lapis in repairing armor and tools along with XP, maybe even for oxidized copper but wax is already a good solution for that. Tin is also used to make solder which&nbsp;is a fusible metal alloy used to create a permanent bond between metal workpieces, so that can change the daylight sensor recipe (maybe one tin ingot and 2 quartz?) And if heat was ever introduced into redstone, tin would be great for that. Now for bronze besides tools, would be a bunch of decorations such as cups, rails, window/door frames, and plaques. Also OP you should change this to “Tin/Bronze”.&nbsp;</p>",

I thought of the exact same thing I also thought about the idea of having steele in the game which would be a in between of iron and diamond. The only thing I disagree with is that iron is stronger than bronze at least from what I know it's more durable and has a higher melting point than bronze meaning it's stronger I think it would be better if it was between stone and iron that way it would make more sense but it would have more crafting options that way there is a reason to go out of your way to get bronze ai also think one thing Minecraft needs along with this expansion would be the invention of the wheel because we have horses and having a wagon with a chest would be really cool in Minecraft it would feel like we would move through time periods and ages just like history and after all there are the achievements stone age and iron age I think it'll be cool if they had a bronze age.</p>",

Especially since obsidian is renewable, from piglin bartering, maybe this would be a good chance for a magic wand to come in. Maybe there could be a spell that dramatically heats up obsidian back into lava, so it would be like that's the only way for obsidian to get that hot to melt, and would keep other minecraft mechanics the same. This would make since, because people might abuse by just surrounding lava around to easily create more if the mechanics were similar to water, ( and lava is pretty powerful,) and people as a result might not have to come to the Nether as much. Maybe the spell could even only work in the Nether.</p>",
