Any server listing site you visit other than Findmcserver, you will see the same servers listed on the site, because they all pay huge monthly premiums to be listed there. Unfortunately Findmcserver's SEO is not strong enough to beat them, nor does it have the budget to do so considering it's (mostly) a free service.<br>Please Mojang, Gamersafer has done an amazing job building a safe, EULA compliant, and family friendly community to showcase high quality servers to a wider audience.

Launcher is perfect for this especially if Mojang feels like they can't modify the multiplayer screen on java due to it being really old or something like that. If they are willing to put a minecraft movie promo in the launcher I don't think they think its sacred enough to not touch for new stuff like this. Also this would perfectly <strong>integrate into the quickplay system</strong> they made relatively recently. The server list could be a tab on the java launcher and it would then pull the list from the gamer safer list basically from the internet. Then when you clicked on a server to join it could pull the IP from the website and boot up minecraft immediately joining the server. Maybe like in the UI for the list there could be a \"Join Server With Profile\" selector thing so that you could select a profile like the MC version to join the server with. Then if you press the button and boot up minecraft to join the server, it could then add the server to your server list. This would help like if you have the wrong version or for some reason can't join the server as you wouldn't want to go back to the launcher for that. In addition, the IP should be visible in the list as well. But that's all the fancy stuff that's possible if you integrate it.</p>",
