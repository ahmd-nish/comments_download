Who wants to keep searching for new geodes?</p>\n<p>Recipe suggestion: 4 Milk buckets can be crafted into one block of calcite. And you get the empty buckets back.</p>\n<p>Why milk? It is white, and it contains a lot of calcium. As does Calcite. This would create a new use for Milk (which I hardly use at all at the moment). To make Milk harder to obtain, there could be a milking cooldown. But ideally Minecraft would also introduce the ability to milk cows &amp; goats with Dispensers.</p>\n<p>If that recipe sounds too easy, maybe change it to 2 Milk buckets + 2 Diorite?</p>",
