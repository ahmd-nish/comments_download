As for the name of the amber resource, I personally like the name \"amber encrusted petrified log\" as it is not quite an ore and this provides a more interesting naming convention. Also, I happen to like the word \"encrusted\" there. I find the idea of using it as another form of glass interesting, especially compared to the new tinted glass. I wonder what its properties would be, maybe act as an opposite to the tinted by magnifying light?</p>\n<p>cranzag: Thank you for this, I had known beforehand that it can be colorful, but I wasn't quite sure how to implement it.

Additionally I agree with the idea of getting resources in new and creative ways, which especially makes me think back to the diamond axe part in my post (we really do need more diamond tier materials for the other tools). You may be interested in another idea that I have been toying around with that may make a future post, involving collecting sap (maple trees or rubber trees for syrup and rubber?) with a bucket from stripped logs of the type.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;CapsuleJ1891: Using it for haste would definitely work, and it is definitely a more wanted/will be one of the more used of the potions, especially for long obsidian mining trips (ever tried building a house out of the stuff?). In regard to mining fatigue, maybe amethyst crystals would work better, as with the glass mentioned by Haruneko125 it is starting to serve as an opposite.</p>\n<p>It turns out that this actually requires 3 posts.</p>",

I had originally dismissed the idea of trapping when I first wrote this post, but now you get me thinking back to it. It could work several ways, being a sort of stronger honey block that can pull entities in contact with it when moved? (Interesting transportation dynamic there) Or maybe something you can share a block with like powder snow, but which is very hard and slow to get out of? Both, with resistance either way and having it move any entities partially stuck in it? What would this mean for builds with it a decoration, and should it have two forms then for sticky vs. not with the sticky a sort of soft/melted form. (If you couldn't tell by that, I also work often with redstone, and commands) By the way, it should have a very distinct texture, maybe something a bit... swirly looking? Also with trapping it makes me think to its potential in the new archaeology mechanic. A lot to think about.</p>\n<p>So that is it for this set of responses. I will be happy to continue to provide feedback on your feedback of my feedback (quite a lot of feedback). If we are in luck this post will be noticed by others, which is the key to getting something through to Mojang as a real possibility. Thanks!</p>",

They are sort of jewelry like addition since real amber is used in jewelry, and act as a different way of applying potion effects. You infuse the amber totem with an effect and then when you drop below half health the totem shatters and releases the stored effect. You could also comsider having a sort of variable crafting recipe which allows the player to pick how the totem will be triggered. But the idea works without that.</p>",

I had to think about it for a little while and then just kept forgetting to get on and do it already. In regard to the new totem/idol/charm suggestion you made, I really like the idea of custom configurable items that respond with effects under certain set conditions. They would likely work similarly to fireworks in that different materials could create the different criteria in the recipe, and would be crafted with some new block, similarly to how they plan to at some point add a specific block for firework crafting. I will note though that I am not sure if this the right time to add it, and feel that it could be better implemented at a later date within some sort of magic oriented system update. While you have specifically mentioned amber, in regard to this post, I would actually venture to use all types of gems for different effects (not potion effects how I am using it here), and use them, as well as plants, as basic components for said magic system. This would also serve as an excellent catalyst to add more gems, as well as providing some specific and useful items for said magic system. It should be noted that to craft the block whose UI would be used for crafting these, or something beforehand that would craft this, should use some rare and much later game material than we currently have now. While this may not be added now, it has at least advanced some of my other ideas.</p>",
