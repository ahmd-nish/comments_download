If a hostile mob can detect a player in bed, the player is not in a safe sleeping environment and should wake up. (Keep in mind, mobs cannot see through blocks.) The game would then display the \"You may not rest now; there are monsters nearby\" message and the mob would be teleported 8 blocks away from the player.</p>\n<p>Since beds are accessible early in the game, it would make sense for sleeping not to completely prevent hostile mobs from spawning. There can currently be a large disparity in gameplay when players are unaware of the hostile mob spawn conditions. On one night, they might sleep early and wake to no monsters, and on another, they might sleep a little later and be surprised by a creeper in the morning.</p>\n<p>Based on both survival and sandbox design principles, players, regardless of their experience or familiarity with the game, should be likely to encounter hostile mobs early on. Minecraft is still intentionally and actively advertised to feature survival gameplay, and basic game knowledge can mitigate the entire design principle of nighttime.</p>\n<p>Making this change strengthens the design principle that \"bad things happen, but they're technically the player's fault.\" The player is still in control to create a safe area to avoid monster encounters, while restoring the beds' role as homes rather than skips.</p>\n<p>To remain fair with the player, it would be great if you could identify whether beds are safe to sleep in before using them, or if a possible upgraded bed, item, block, or armor enchantment retain the current mechanics, so advanced players don't necessarily have to adapt to the change.</p>",
