And it would help players remember this particular type of rhino, which is the goal. Also its cooler.</p>\n<p>An important thing to remember is that Mojang doesn't add mobs willy nilly. Each mob is well thought through so that when it is added it integrates into the world nicely. At least that's how things are done now.</p>\n<p>Every mob needs some sort of purpose, for clearness we will confine ourselves to passive real animal mobs. Armadillos were not just added because they're fun, they brought wolf armor. Axolotls give admittedly no reward that's important, but they seem too me like a reward in and of themselves because they are a rare find, and than there's the whole blue axolotl chance with is fun.</p>\n<p>The rhino needs to give a reward, but we don't want to encourage players to kill these mobs, as that defeats the purpose. One option would be to have it dig up something using its horn (touting a little known rhino feature, and teaching people that rhinos horse aren't simply for fights).</p>\n<p>However a rhino can't simply be hostile in Minecraft. All Minecraft hostile mobs must be fantasy. This is a rule that mojang has set and after thinking about it a lot I really like this rule and respect it greatly.</p>",
