Due to their small hit boxes they tend to take suffocation dmg very easily. Flying into a block that's not transparent like glass can easily lead them to taking a point of dmg or two. Merely exiting their hive if it's blocked on any side by a solid block can often have them take a tick or two of dmg before they move off.</p>\n<p>Some form of self preservation would be great. Either they heal while in the hive, possibly a small chance to self breed while in a hive with full honey levels or something. The bad AI, low hp and many sources of dmg that can kill a Bee (never mind the fact they die if they sting something) can easily wipe out your entire colony with ease.<br><br>Most automated farms are not too hurt by this, but if you don't want to enclose everything in glass and trap your bee's they are very fragile. It ruins the ability to use them for more aesthetic builds, like having free roaming bee's over your fields.</p>",

I have to continue to breed them in order for the population to stay at peak volume.</p>\n<p>If they slowly regenerated health, or regenerated health in the hive, that would be awesome. Or even if they could just refresh their health entirely in the hive! If I'm not mistaken players used to (or still do) get their health bar replenished when sleeping in a bed.
