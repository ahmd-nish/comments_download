A player can wear antlers on his/her head to gain the “sculk sense” effect. This effect is similar to the nausea or blindness effects, it permanently modified the player’s vision until the antlers are removed (either one antler is placed in the helmet slot, or an “antler helmet” type item could be made with just two antlers. Either way works). The sculk sense effect would essentially switch the player’s vision from regular to the vision of a Warden. The player can only see a black screen, other than grayish outlines of unidentifiable blocks for the environment. When the player sees movement, a white blip would eminate from the source of the movement or sound to notify the player of movement. This effect could be really fun for mini games, also the antlers would just look dope as a helmet type item.\n<br />2. A player can combine one antler with an arrow to create a “sculk arrow.” When shot at a player, this arrow will add the “sculk sense” effect to any player hit with the arrow. The effect will be applied for 15 seconds, then the duration ends. (Details pt 1, continued in comments)</p>",

In the Caves &amp; Cliffs FAQ, they didn't mention or even hint that the Sculk features will be in the Summer update, so it's almost certain that they will come in the holiday release. Also how can you have blocks and a mob that is meant to be a part of a dark huge cave just appear randomly when you're exploring in the open air in a totally different dimension? The people who are saying that the End and Sculk are related are just speculating about Minecraft lore, which is something you're meant to do. No direct correlation between the Sculk and the End has been given or confirmed, and by doing what you want them to do they'd just be saying \"the Sculk and End are related\" despite nobody ever confirming that. It's meant to be a mystrey of the Minecraft lore. I just don't see how any of this could come together. It doesn't add strategy to the End, it makes it inconsistent and makes End Cities frustrating, as you're meant to move around freely within them.</p>",

First of all, you not considering the Deep Dark as a biome doesn't really make any sense. It is an extremely unique place with a ton of exclusive blocks, mechanics and gameplay, but it is almost certainly has an environment as well that would make it feel like a biome rather than a structure. I think you mean that it feels so unique and different and has so many specific and mind blowing features that it feels more like a generated structure, but I don't get how that contradicts with it being counted as a biome. They would definitely give it an environment and polish that makes it feel more with the rest of the caves and feel more like you're exploring a biome rather than a structure. Kingbdogz has explicitly said it wouldn't even look remotely the same as we've seen in the video. I would definitely love for the caves to have exclusive music and more ambience, but we don't know whether this would happen or not, and we can't judge the polish of the update since they're not even close to the stage were they are done. This update is so huge, and the things they've done are already revolutionary, so I'm just suggesting that we need to be a little more patient before we could truly judge the update and talk about the more cosmetic features like music and animations of very specific mobs.</p>",

World generation and new height, ore distribution and new biomes have been postponed into a holiday update, while most of the smaller features like Copper, Amethysts, Goats, Glow Squids and Axolotols will come this summer. With that new timeline, the developers will definitely have time to fully enhance, polish and perhaps expand the update. Honestly with the old timeline and the development pace, I could barely imagine them being able to add new sound design, let alone come up with new biomes that are valuable and would fit with the update. However, now with the new timeline, I'm fully confident they will be able to pay attention to all of the small details that bring more life to an update, as well as fulfilling the design of major feature like the Deep Dark and Warden. Perhaps they might also get inspired along the way to add a new biome that actually contributes to the design of the update and adds more variety.</p>",
