Even massive Onis who wield axes and nekomatas who use bows with poison AND weakness arrows and potions to aid themselves replacing your ravegers and pillager army.</p>\n<p>They could drop new their weapons as well as new totems, like a totem of will that Increases damage when you lose health, alongside new potions and brewing Items.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You could find \"hungry camps\", where yokai and hostile wraiths live. And entering a bastion With bad omen, which can be given In the nether by killing a okami shogun, which Is just an okami with a banner, will trigger an ambush.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Fish-eating eagle (I forgot the name), and the Golden in eagle of the Mongolian Desert. Should exist in different biomes but will always spawn in and have nests in high altitudes. When their nests are approached they fly away . You should stay still and crouch while holding the meat used for taming in your hand. They will slowly approach you and then you could tame them. Kind of like taming stray cats. Also this idea can bring many people together, since a lot of cultures use birds for hunting.</p>\n<p>I hope the Mojang Team take this seriously because it's a really amazing idea.</p>",

This could be something that wears off with time, or wears off when they get in water and wash it off.

And these will be so annoying. Go to my Account if you like this Idea.</p>",

What's great about caribou is that both males and females grow antlers, so in Minecraft, they can easily be ambiguous.</p>\n<p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Much like turtles, caribou have set <strong class=\"yklcuq-14 gLhJob\">\"home\" biomes</strong>. <em class=\"yklcuq-15 llXuhU\">An idea I've considered is that the caribou could have two home biomes so they can</em> <em class=\"yklcuq-15 llXuhU\"><strong class=\"yklcuq-14 gLhJob\">migrate</strong></em> <em class=\"yklcuq-15 llXuhU\">like they do in real life, but there would be an issue with chunk-loading.</em> So I think it would be best if caribou just had a set home where they graze; then they can wander off and then come back every few days.</p>\n<p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Caribou can be tamed with carrots to become <strong class=\"yklcuq-14 gLhJob\">Reindeer</strong> which can be ridden and can carry saddlebags. What's special about reindeer is that they can move especially fast through snow biomes.</p>\n<p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/3csVSm0GPEpNjsI5x7Ur1Q.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Much like how chickens lay eggs, caribou could infrequently shed their antlers. <strong class=\"yklcuq-14 gLhJob\">Antlers</strong> can be used to convert obsidian blocks into <a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360012144431-Obsidian-Shards-and-Obsidian-Arrows\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong class=\"yklcuq-14 gLhJob\">Obsidian Shards</strong></a>; whether that conversion is via crafting or mining is up to the developers. It'd be fine if it was by breaking obsidian as long as the player can't craft obsidian blocks with the shards.</p>\n<p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/69zRvg8VYE3pFh3SEoWaWA.png\"></p>\n<p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\">Antlers can also be used as heraldry in banners!</p>\n<p class=\"yklcuq-10 hpxQMr\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/_WNj_N9WH-pkSeTl-fSM1w.png\">Caribou will also drop Raw Venison, which when cooked is slightly better than Steak.

Although you can potentially find as much as you need, a renewable (and farmable, if you're clever enough) source of netherite would be great.

I think they could look really cool there, however since the whole place is filled with endermen. I think it would make it too chaotic. Fighting chicken like phantoms in a forest where if you look at anyone you will be attacked seems to difficult. But that is also why I added them to the Basalt deltas. That is their true home, they only go to the Crimson forest for food. In the basalt deltas, nothing can reach them but Ghasts. So their eggs and babies are safe. Thank you for your feedback!</p>",

These sorts of trades would make the Trader accessible, help exchange items for potentially more useful things or even Emeralds (20 copper blocks=1 emerald). Mining for emeralds takes a while, and unless you go to villages most players won't have a stack of emeralds around. Logically Traders and Merchants would barter goods for goods as well, so lore-wise it fits nicely.</p>",

This implies that the wandering trader actually travels and picks up stock from the different villages and sells the things that he gets there. There could also be a leveling system for the wandering traders that would increase the likelihood that they trade the rare items like the biome specific books. This could be done like trading with villagers to upgrade their sales.&nbsp;</p>",
