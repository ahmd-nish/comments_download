So you can work to craft up good spells without depending on the enchanting table random luck for your gear, less grinding more spell control, and more reward by investing time into making spell books.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I personally don't use the other books as much, but on a server with lore or more invested people I can see the appeal for vibe of normal bookshelf though with color options.&nbsp;</p>",
