Because the complexity and required redstone makes this a late game concept it makes it harder to call it overpowered or to argue against it.\n<br />By having a hopper fill in the slots in a set order including the slots that won't be used, using a placeholder such as gravel blocks and then removing the placeholder blocks with a item filter hopper system any crafting recipe is achievable. Afterwards upon adding a redstone pulse it should produce an item to be output into a hopper.</p>\n\n<p>I like your concept however I don't believe it would really work unless you can explain how you would have your dispensers and droppers select which slots are filled and which aren't.\n<br />I kind of understand what you are describing, but it seems all having a dropper or dispenser output nothing would do is cause it to try again with the next space it has available rather than changing which slot is selected on the crafting table.  \n<br />This problem is easily fixed, but would change not only how the crafting table works but also dispensers and droppers which would unfortunately make the concept less palatable to developers. \n<br />If your method was pursued it would have to work by having an empty output cause a slot to be skipped rather than simply outputting all content in order at once otherwise many preexisting redstone machines would be permanently broken.</p>",

I may have been unclear on how the dropper device would work, and I know the system of using hoppers can work, (with the proper circuits) and it is probably better than my idea, but having a variety of ideas increases the chances of one idea that the devs like, and, therefore, the likelihood of this getting added to the game. to be as precise as I can, in my idea, droppers would check for crafting tables in front of them, using a variation of the check hoppers use to decrease lag, and when a dropper detects a crafting table, it would discharge one of everything in its inventory in the order shown instead of firing one at a time and breaking when there was an empty space. to use a better example, space zero in a dispenser has 64 red stone dust in it. the third space has 64 sticks. everything else is empty. the dropper receives a red stone pulse and fires one red stone dust into the crafting table into space zero, and one stick into space three. a comparator reading the table sends a red stone output that travels through wire to the table. the table receives the red stone pulse and crafts the red stone torch. the torch is then pulled from the table into a hopper and pushed into a chest. I hope this clears it up, and I want this, in either form. another idea follows.</p>",
