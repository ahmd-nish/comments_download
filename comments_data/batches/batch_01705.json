It is better to support JS, C + +, Python and even PHP to attract more developers to join. Due to the ecological defects of BSD and its lack of support for multi world, our work is extremely difficult. We favor the complete game features of BDS, but we are also discussing whether to switch to pmmp, which we don't want to see. So for developers like us and countless players, please support it as soon as possible! If we can reply to this suggestion within two weeks, we will insist on using BDS and create infinite brilliance in it.</p>",

They cant even be bothered to monitor the servers. They only care about the gamemodes that brings in money which is minigames and prison no other gamemodes actually worth it. Survival is non exsistant with no ability to craft mine or do anything in a small box world where ppl just trashtalk. Skyblocks are all the same claiming to update but never do. And lets b rea ppl have already done the ip stuff on pc and thats what made minecraft popular as almost everyone on minecraft wants this to be like java edition we all know the risks and know how to avoid it.
