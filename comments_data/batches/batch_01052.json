The first time you summon the Warden should be more forgiving, and ramp up in difficulty with each time you fail to keep from summoning it. Increasing the amount of time the Warden will search for the player will force the player to either run further away, or hide for much longer. It would also give the Warden more time to wander around and increase the chance of running into the player while they are hiding. The Warden should make you dread every second it's stalking you and require an active role on the part of the player in order to escape. Currently I believe the Warden is too easy to lose by simply standing in place and waiting for a short while for it to burrow into the ground. That feels too passive and simply isn't dangerous or imposing enough.</p>",

Of course if the player is swimming in a body of water with the Warden lurking below that doesn't allow the Warden to attack the player, which is why I think a knockback projectile based attack would be a good fit. Not only would it be terrifying getting attacked from below the surface, but it would also prevent the player from pillaring to safety or standing in a tunnel too small for the Warden to fit into. You should have to actively escape from the Warden so going beyond its range of physical attacks while still being within its line of sight shouldn't mean you're safe. The projectile shouldn't do much damage, but it shouldn't be too weak either. I think 2-3 hearts is fair. The main threat would be getting knocked from a high cliff, but standing in a tunnel should also put you at risk of dying if you're hit multiple times in a row.</p>",

If the player is able to reach a higher ledge where the Warden can't get to them, then I'd say their efforts should be rewarded with a successful escape. Similarly for the player swimming above the Warden in a body of water. If the player can reach the shore while leaving the Warden stuck in an aquifer or something then the player took an active enough role in escaping in my opinion. This goes for tunneling as well. My main concern is that the player shouldn't be able to stand still and taunt the Warden by standing in its line of sight without facing some retaliation. Of course the knockback can be negated with Netherite armor and shields, so it would reward players for coming prepared while exploring the ancient cities. I think all of these ideas fit the tone and feeling of what is already established about the Warden and are balanced enough to fair to all players.</p>",

This would be sculk spreading in the area the warden burrows in (If there was none) and, borrowing from your idea, creating a catalyst if none are nearby?</p>\n<p>This would provide an organic way for skulk to spread, even if it is limited by the range of the shriekers, as a warden would only ever spawn close to a shrieker. If shriekers spread, there could be a situation where many wardens would spawn, but with behaviour as described previously this wouldn't be an issue. (An interesting idea would also be to have sculk limit mob spawns, but it would be a very big change)</p>\n<p>Overall this would add new ways to generate sculk and sculk blocks, along with a slow, limited spread of the skulk that reinforces the perceived behaviour. Possible issues could come with overwriting blocks that shouldn't be overwritten, however this seems to have already been considered with the sculk catalyst and shouldn't pose a problem if implemented in the Warden</p>",

Of course one could simply <strong>NOT</strong> zombify and cure the villagers to make mending practically free, but when there is an easy route, the easy route is usually taken even if the easy route is boring at its easiness.&nbsp;</p>",
