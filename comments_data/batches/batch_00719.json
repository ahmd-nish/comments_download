If ore veins were too common it would completely destroy early game progression, but if they were too rare and without a way to find them, players couldn't reliably find them in the late game. The idea for compasses to malfunction around ore deposits is genius--it's a real phenomenon, it gives a use to compasses, and feels a lot closer to vanilla than things like \"ore maps\". Some suggestions to expand on your idea: When the player's x/z coordinates are within, say, 30 blocks of any part of an ore vein, compasses would start to slightly move back and forth, but barely noticeably. The closer the player gets to the vein (in terms of x/z coordinates), the more it'll spin and generally act weird. And if the player is higher or lower than the vein, the spinning will be slightly less noticeable--this way the player can still detect a vein from the surface, but be able to zero in on its depth.</p>",

Iron farms aren't made until the mid/late game, since they can be pretty complicated to build, and in the scope of the early game, one doesn't need stacks of iron. I think making ore veins harder to find (and adding the compass mechanic) would make vein mining at least as viable as iron farming in late game. And yes, mining in deepslate is slow, but that's what enchanted pickaxes are for. Iron farming has always seemed like an exploit to me, so it's good to know there's a legitimate way to get masses of iron.</p>",

It adds more incentive to find the rare, illusive mountains. As for structure ideas, why not a mining lodge? Kind of a combination of the ski lodge and a mining village. Seeing as the mountains will have a bounty of emeralds, it would only make sense that villagers would swarm the cliffs in search for riches. As part of the lodge/village, there could be emerald vaults, or the chests found around the lodge/village could have emeralds instead of the random items found in normal village chests.

However, copper is even more easily acquired, due to the fact that copper drops more than 1 raw copper/ore. A good proposal though, and I'd like to see this in-game (especially because you can see your beacon base aging, showing you how long that beacon has been helping you)</p>",
