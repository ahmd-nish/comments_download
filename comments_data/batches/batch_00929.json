For attending we get news for upcoming stuff, QnA panel, and a Minecon 2022 cape code. This would be another chance for players to interact instead of a YouTube stream. There can also be a a 30-minute wait before the evet where players can interact and there could be minigames. Overall, I think players that never got to go to Minecon in person (Like me) would love to experience this. P.S If anyone knows the actual e-mail address for Mojang then tell me. Also I don't even know if I @ the right person so yea. Edit: I wrote this just now and hope this gets noticed.</p>",

Id be ok if it takes them 1 to 3 years for updates. That in combination with game drops would imo be ideal. But gamedrops only...big big downgrade. </p>\n\n<p>I realize they do have another team besides the 2 drop teams. Someone has to work on VibrantVisuals after all.
