        "body": "<p>Here are my thoughts:</p>\n<p>I think that, first of all, having an Adventure Pass needed to unlock over half of the cosmetics was a bad idea. Even if it was mentioned in a video that there would be paid content, I think that, since these features like the capes and pets, aren’t very important and are more as means of player expression, paying money for something that shouldn’t effect gameplay that much doesn’t make much sense. If the team is needing a better way of earning income from MC Dungeons, fine. But in that case, why <em>this? </em>These little additions should’ve been free, with maybe the Tower being paid for. Though, that might make it worse, IDK.</p>\n<p>Another thing is the Challenges. When waiting for the Cloudy Climb, I thought we’d get more in-depth and interesting goals. (Kill 2 Skeletons with one arrow, kill 10 mobs with a TNT block, etc.) Instead, things like, “Eat 1000 food,” or, “kill 1000 mobs” are in they’re places. This is definitely less of an issue than the Adventure Pass, but it’s still something that I feel could be improved with the next season. (Which should TOTALLY be called the Spelunker’s Sprawl. Just an idea, though.)</p>\n<p>Overall, the Seasonal Adventures have lots of potential, if future ones are to come. They just need to be made more accessible and easy to learn, unlike the mess that is the Cloudy Climb. Please take this advice not as me jabbing Mojang with a pointy stick, but me wanting this game to be awesome.&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>Have a great day!</p>",

        "body": "<p>The new progression system is diverse and interesting, yet has a lot of issues that leave more to be desired. <br>I'd like to start off with the random empty slots in the free track and leaving the bulk of cosmetics to paid players. If players have had to pay for 6 DLCs, making them likely to partake in the new activities this season, why should they pay MORE for accessing the fruit of the content that this update has? Adding more cosmetics to the free track or downright making the free track shorter without empty slots (so that you are always getting rewards for levelling up) would be a good solution. <br>Another thing that bothers me is the speed of progression. Right now, it's too slow. Perhaps you could have a way to track points and ranks during the mission, as shown in the trailer, as well as generally flattening the incremental curve in getting the next rank that ranking up follows. This can be done by making missions and ancient hunts reward more adventure points overall (like, say 10-20 per run if solid exploration is done). <br>Lastly, make weekly challenges require more strategy. Having things like defeating x enchanted mobs without taking damage from them or defeat x mobs via pet kills (player intervention not counting to this) or do x tower floors without taking damage.<br>I appreciate the effort that Mojang sank into this project, and would love to see what more they can do with it. Cheers, and take care devs!<br>TL;DR: <br>make adventure ranking trackable, and more to the free track.</p>",

Having a few more rewards to fill a bit the gaps while also having more cosmetic variety would help the free track not feel as empty.<br><br>The only other thing I have is a small nick pick. The two skins, Pride and Warrior are a great addition to the already diverse cast of Minecraft Dungeons. but in order to use them, you need to have bought the season 1 paid track. This in it of it self is fine, but considering that Pride is the only character that is Actively representing the LGBTQ+ community. It does feel a little weird having to pay a bit just to have more diversity. I would gladly swap the places of Knight, Keeper, or even MOBBO if it means having everyone have the chance to unlock with out any additional paywall.<br><br>Though that is still just a nick pick, just having them in the game is enough for me :D&nbsp;</p>",

The paid one has all its slots full of rewards and paid players get both tracks too so we still get the short end of the free tracks stick.</p>\n<p>Second, cross compatibly of the cosmetics. Make the cosmetics types (that make sense) cross over to the main games, Java &amp; Bedrock. Let us use out emotes and capes from Minecraft Dungeons in Java &amp; Bedrock. Dungeons has emotes that already exist in Bedrock with the exact same name (Do the Pickaxe, The Elytra); we cant we use them on those editions? Our capes would give us more options and even incentive to play not only Dungeons, but try the other editions and bring more Bedrock &amp; Java players to try Dungeons for more cosmetics in the main games. Minecraft Earth did this with its character creator rewards even before it shut down for its veteran, paid, and free players who completed task/achviements &amp; events, if MC Earth's cosmetics cross over, why not Dungeon's especially given how we've paid for them and spend months grinding for them/2 years collecting them?</p>\n<p>Finally, More ways to level up and reward more by difficulty. Not sure if completing banner enhanced missions counts towards XP but it should. Daily trails and harder missions as well as picking up banners should give more XP.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Overall, great idea. It does need some polishing; it should be slightly easier to get adventure points since it is currently very slow to level up with adventure points. I do not know if this was intentional but it would most likely be better if it became faster to level up. We should also have more interesting challenges. Not necessarily easier, but more unique. Like killing all undead mobs 3 times in a row with a melee weapon or something along those lines. The rewards themselves are fine, but I think that fewer rewards should be behind a paywall since half of them currently are. I like the idea that adventure points are most efficiently earned in The Tower, but I think that some missions should offer adventure points quicker than The Tower to show some diversity. Maybe you could add extra adventure points to daily trials to incentivize players to play daily trials. If you made adventure points on daily trials 25-30% higher, more people would probably play. I also think there should be an extra bar for adventure points instead of it showing up in place of the levels bar every once in a blue moon. Anyway, that's my two cents.</p>",
