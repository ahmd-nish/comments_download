After that you have to throw an weakness posion and feed an OP Apple. (like healing Zombievillagers) <br>Then they are tamed. They cant follow you just sit on your shoulders or on the Ground. You can ride (fly) them for a time (10min + -) and then they have to land. After this the Harpy sits on your shoulders or on the Ground and has to rest for 10min. <br>Informations:<br>Max. Health, Speed and Max., Flight altitude differs just like horse stats<br>They are 1,2-1,5 blocks high, hostile before tamed<br>and when they sit on your shoulders you get slowness. (Same Animation like when Babyzombies sit on Zombies) Riding (Flying) the Harpy: Sit on the Slope of the back of the Harpy. (May saddle nedded) The waiting Phase can be boosted by feeding 10+ Meat (Pig, Cow, Rotted, Sheep, Bunny) by 80% but not more. The Harpy cant move while the waiting Phase, just be carried. Biomes for spawnig could be Jungle, Savanna or Deasert. <br>For balancing a saddle could be needed, or a Chest can be added just like to Lamas or Donkeys. <br>I got this idea by People wanting \"Pet Dragons\", i think becouse People want a rideable flying creature. So I worked out this one, becouse I think Harpys fits better into Minecraft then Pet Dragons.</p>",
