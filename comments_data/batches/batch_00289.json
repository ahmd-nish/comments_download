I have a great adventure map and players keep complaining that they can't move freely around the map because of it. The frames, the stands at the limit are not too problematic., but an adventure map without being able to move is absurd... The only trick I found is to deactivate the aggressive mobs to avoid get ejected from minecart in case of attack. But that completely takes away the fun of the game... I don't understand this principle and that no one has thought of it among the devs. It's like... an FPS where you couldn't pick up guns when they drop o_O</p>",
