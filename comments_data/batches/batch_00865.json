Should it target the first player, the second player, or both? That's why I proposed the tags solution, because you can tag either player beforehand to specify which one to target later.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pretty simply, you just don't log entities for commands that take more than one entity. Even doing this, if you desired, you could set up a command that logs the chosen player beforehand, even if it's just through something like /testfor. Or better yet, use /execute to log it in the same command block, by going like so:</p>\n<p>execute @p[name=test] ~ ~ ~ tp @s @p[name=testB]</p>\n<p>give @c diamond 64</p>\n<p>Here, the @c would be referencing the entity who was executed on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And finally, to answer a question I thought of: what would happen if you used @a or @e? The way I would do it, is that if @a or @e were used, it would store the actual target selector, rather than an individual entity.</p>",
