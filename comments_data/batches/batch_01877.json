The sickle would also offer a whole new strategy when it comes to fights.</p>\n<p>PvP, the Sickle would become a surprise attack weapon, you sneak up too your opponents from behind, and than with one hit you gain a massive health advantage, or maybe kill them if they were already damaged. The Sickle would also force players too be more weary during open matches, if your opponent just manages to get behind you than you might be dead.</p>\n<p>PvE, getting behind monsters can be tough, so using a sickle on one would require more strategy. The mace requires wind charges too be really effective, the Sickle would require that you either distract the monster with another mob (like a dog), trap them in cobwebs, or put a pumpkin on their head.</p>\n<p>It's important that the creaking core is dropped only from naturally generated hearts, so that you have to explore the pale gardens and fight the Creaking.

        "body": "<p>First, you're right, sickles are not any better at surprise attacks than a kitchen knife, in fact sickles are not designed as weapons. But Minecraft focuses on peoples perception and imagination instead of reality. Take the mace for example, in real life the idea that you should jump from a high place and land a crushing blow on an opponent is ridicules, it makes no sense. And why choose a mace? A hammer would have been much more understandable and simple. But Minecraft doesn't worry about this, it appeals to the imagination. What do we do with a heavy weapon? We slam people with it. And so the awesome/absurd idea of a slam attack was created. Minecraft also likes to choose more obscure items, this makes it feel more interesting and uniquely Minecraft. Thus, mace instead of hammer. Also, the mace's appearance is purely imaginary and fun, not like a real mace in any way.</p>\n<p>The sickle would be a cool weapon, its outlandish and unexpected, but so was the mace.</p>\n<p>It is true, using this weapon in PvE is hard, maybe even to the point where it's unpractical, but the same is true of the mace. Without wind charges the mace is a tough weapon to use effectively, not to mention that if your timing is off you'll take fall damage and most likely get hit by the enemy. But I think the sickle is still useable, it may be harder, but there's also much less punishment for failure. Here are some ways players can use it on enemies.</p>\n<p>(continued)</p>",

Craved Pumpkin; I didn't specify this in the post (pardon me) but when wearing a pumpkin mobs do not count as \"seeing you\", so when fighting a zombie you can drop a carved pumpkin for him to wear, than land a critical hit on him. This may seem overly complicated, it would be easier to use a sword, but the same is true for the mace. This would be more useful on mobs like piglin brutes.</p>\n<p>2. Distraction; during many fights mobs will target your dogs instead of you, and many times skeletons will get into fights with other monsters, in these situations you can easily maneuver yourself behind an enemy. This can also be done with villagers and golems. However, this would be super easy in multiplayer, mobs can only target one player at a time, so the other player can get behind them.</p>\n<p>3. Invisibility; invisibility makes it much harder for mobs to notice you, especially if you're not wearing any armor, this makes it possible to maneuver around them. This fits the ninja vibe the weapon gives.</p>\n<p>4. Not so much a technique, but there are many mobs that are not naturally hostile, these mobs you can get around to their backs. It's easy to get behind an enderman or piglin, and the sickle should be strong enough to oneshot these enemies. Guardians can't sense you unless they see you directly so it works on them. Enchant the sickle to make it more powerful and maybe you could one shot an iron golem. The warden doesn't auto track the player so you can get behind it and hit it (if your daring).</p>",

I seek to change that using an overhaul of its current features, along with adding some new ones. I'd also like to include those found in the biome vote. So, here's my intro idea!</p>\n<p>The deserts of Minecraft are rather plain, but the ones of Minecraft Dungeons are the opposite. They have new trees, new structures, &amp;... sand layers? I think that Minecraft should give sand some of the variants snow has, mainly sand layers. This would add a better landscape to the biome. It could generate during sandstorms, a new weather type only available in the desert. When a player is inside a sandstorm cloud, they will be damaged over time.</p>\n<p>Another Idea I had was a hidden dungeon beneath the sand, including a new weapon; the Glaive. It has a farther reach, &amp; deals heavy damage if used from behind. Use the new enchantment \"poison edge\" to make it inflict poison upon use.</p>",

You cannot get there by portal, but by flying above the height limit. It should be at least a hundred blocks above, in case the height limit is altered in a future update. In this new dimension, there are new lush biomes, &amp; powerful ores. Starstone can be found at the bottom of every island, &amp; no stars can be seen in the sky, adding to the lore of the game. Starstone can be smelted into 3 ingots at a time, &amp; crafted into diamond level armor that grants you speed, jump boost, &amp; slow falling when the full set is worn. Can only be mined with a diamond pickaxe. The Clouds can be seen beneath this dimension's skybox.</p>",
