Anyway,</p>\n<p>\"So I think pet houses would be good for this. Basically, each house could fit three animals of their respective type, and would basically function like job blocks/beds for villagers. Cat towers and bird houses/cages would each have 3 rooms or compartments. Each bird/cat would go to one of the rooms at night to go to sleep. Dogs would have doghouses, and foxes would have whatever foxes sleep in. Maybe a den that you need to build into the ground? The three assigned to each one would all share the same room, though, where they would just cuddle together at night. Other animals could potentially have them as well, but it wouldn't change much.</p>\n<p><br>The pet housing would set the pets to the village, the same way beds do with villagers. They would roam this area, and potentially have their own antics that they do, like dogs chasing cats, or cats pawing at stuff. At night, if their housing is assigned to an area they can't get to, they will paw at the door or wait outside until a villager or player lets them in to sleep. If no one does, they will just sleep on the ground outside of the door. They would also protect the village the same way they do the player.\"</p>",
