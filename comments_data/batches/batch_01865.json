Here’s my take on the idea:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it is, both copper and iron ore can be mined using a stone pickaxe. And, because both copper and iron are very common and generate at similar y-levels, there is little incentive to make copper tools. Iron tools are superior to copper in every way, and there’s just no reason to mine and smelt copper when you could mine and smelt iron instead. If nothing is done with copper tools to make them more useful and unique, they will end up being ignored just as hard as gold tools are, and bloat the game with more useless items.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Requiring a copper pickaxe to mine iron ore would incentivize players to make and use copper tools. It would give copper a necessary role in progression, add more content to the early game, and spice up the ore progression tree, which has remained stagnant for well over a decade (excluding Netherite).</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Admittedly, this isn’t a full solution to the problem. If this change were implemented, and copper pickaxes were needed to mine iron, the two ores generate so often and near each other that copper would fall into the same boat as wooden tools. Copper tools would become transitional items that are created and discarded within minutes, without seeing any real use.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Along with this change, <a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/38037061196813\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the distribution of iron ore generation would also need to change</a> to balance the early game.</span></p>",

Also I remember this Gold Armor has special ability which makes you welcome to piglins, add special ability to copper which makes the wearer of it become Lightning Rod but instead of getting damaged from Lightning, it makes the user become charged like creepers so if mobs or players tried to hurt the wearer of Copper Armor they will be hurt also for once but the damage is ⅕ of the damage back from the attacker, which example was 10 damage/5 heart damage. The attacker will receive half heart or 2 damage if the user was charged by lightning, but when user was hit once, the charged effect will worn off immediately while it damaged the attacker at the same time.</p>",

        "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I suggest simplifying this by giving all four variants the same mechanic with varying levels of strength. Out of the two mechanics you suggested, I think that copper pressure plates increasing in signal strength will be the most useful especially in game design as you would be able control how long a player has to wait in order to do something. Of course, you can already do this, however it will lead to more compacted redstone which is always welcome. The different variants will determine how long you have to wait to charge up the signal, shorter if normal, longer if oxidized.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you think about it, the second mechanic is practically a button. Perhaps different variants of copper buttons could have signal strengths that last longer.&nbsp;</span></p>",

I think for each stage of oxidation, there would be 1 extra redstone tick of delay between signal updates. So the normal plate would take 1.5 seconds to reach 15 signal strength (gaining 1 every 0.1 seconds), then for the other weatherings it would be 3 seconds, then 4.5 seconds, and finally 6 seconds for the fully oxidized plate. I really hope this gets seen &amp; implemented!</p>",
