One such way is a a finite \"vote budget\" that each user can spend on the things they want more, but I can't imagine a simple way to do it so it would be useful, and wouldn't cause inflation when we transfer over - which would devalue all existing posts. Also, there would still only be the one way to measure popularity of a post. Looking at vote count alone, you woud not be able to distinguish between many people thinking something is a good idea, versus only one person or a few people wanting something really really badly.</p>\n<p>I wouid want to stick with vote count measuring the number of bodies, and to include priority as a separate value.</p>",
