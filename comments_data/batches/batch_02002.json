        "body": "<p>Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes, Please.</p>\n<p>I think most players in the game end up having to craft stacks upon stacks of slabs (any kind - wood, stone, cobblestone, stone brick, etc) at some point. This saves having to search through the recipe book when you could just Shift+(click,click,click) three stacks of the material into the first three slots.</p>\n<p>Also, there are a lot of recipes that only have <strong>one</strong> ingredient - uncrafting any of the storage block types (iron, redstone, coal, bone, etc), crafting flowers into dye, bones into bonemeal - that would benefit from this.</p>\n<p>There are also many other recipes you can make or get close approximations of by shift-clicking each ingredient in turn, and then doing a quick stack-split or click-move-click maneuver to get the actual recipe.</p>\n<p>Even when making something like a single piston, you could get a benefit by shift-clicking &gt;=1 iron, &gt;=4 cobblestone, &gt;=3 planks, and &gt;=1 redstone into the grid, and then appropriately rearranging them and click-dragging all within the 3x3 grid, so you don't have to keep going back and forth between searching through your inventory for the next item and placing the ingredients in the crafting grid (e.g. oh wait, which slot is the iron in?, etc). In a sense, the player would be able to use a more efficient algorithm:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Move all materials required for recipe into the grid by shift-clicking.</li>\n<li>Move mouse to the crafting grid.</li>\n<li>Rearrange all the items into the desired shape.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>instead of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find next item needed for the recipe.</li>\n<li>Move item into correct slot(s) of the 3x3 crafting grid.</li>\n<li>If the recipe is finished, quit here.</li>\n<li>Move the mouse back to the player's inventory.</li>\n<li>Go to step 1.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, for me this is mainly for the 3x3 crafting grid. For the 2x2 crafting grid in the player's inventory, I don't mind if that remains inconvenient, since making that shift-clickable that would override the ability to shift-click to and from the hotbar.</p>",

An interface similar to Bedrock, see the command on several lines</li>\n<li>In the key configuration menu, the addition of button to quickly change between QWERTY and AZERTY, By default Minecraft defines the confugiration for \"American\" keyboards.</li>\n<li>For the key menu add a search bar. To search by \"Key\" or by \"Label\".</li>\n<li>A global search bar in the settings to search among all minecraft options.\n<blockquote>It is once again in a context where the number of new functionalities is added, it becomes more and more complicated to know where a configuration is.

The 1.18 blending option is really amazing from a technical perspective and I am impressed with the effort it took to do this, but the feature is half-baked and leaves a lot to be desired for the conversion of older worlds.</p>\n<p>We play on realms so that means a simulation distance of 4. We have entire strips of terrain that are 1 chunk or 2 chunks wide that are now blended 1.18 generation and look completely jacked up. im not very happy with the result.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the ship has already sailed so it may be too late for me and for 1.18 but for future releases, the world blending should \"feather\" by 1 or 2 chunks. If you open up a Minecraft world in an editor like Amulet you can see where the chunks are allocated. A simple feathering algorithm which would use 1.17 generation around existing chunks for 1 or 2 chunks before starting the new 1.18 blended chunk would've almost completely solved the challenge i am having converting my world from 1.17 to 1.18.</p>\n<p>Technically this should be a relatively simple thing to achieve. when a chunk is instantiated within the sim distance, minecraft should check for bordering original 1.17 chunks and decide whether it uses 1.17 gen or 1.18 gen. after it gets 2 chunks away from an original 1.17 chunk it would use 1.18 gen. relatively simple fix!</p>",
