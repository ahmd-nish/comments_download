Below you will find a transcription of the topic being discussed. <br><br><strong>Title:</strong> “The speed of droplets falling from the block.” <br><br><strong>Text:</strong> “I thought that there is a density of blocks in Minecraft, and in fact it should influence the rate at which droplets of lava or water are formed from the lower side of the block. For example: if you carry a full block of water on top of a block of earth, then droplets form quickly, and if there is not a complete block of water above the block of earth, then a little slower. And if, instead of a block of earth, there are absidians, then the droplets are formed very very slowly. And now if there is 1 more water block above any of the blocks, then the speed will be 1 unit higher. In the case of lava, it seems to me that its speed should be 1 unit less. And yet, if we assume that there is 1 more block under the block that is in contact with water, then drops from this block will fall at the speed calculated by the formula (the speed of droplets falling from 1 block is the speed of droplets falling from 2 blocks under the same circumstances as in block 1.) It seems to me that this detail, although very small, is very realistic..”</p>\n<p>- Translated by Admin</p>",

That fits better with the dark sky, the endermen, the obsidian and purpur structures. Also, this “whitestone” would allow to make white bricks, and I think people will like to use it (at least more than the yellow endstone bricks).</p>\n<p class=\"western\">I would be OK with a replacement but I also thought: what if there were more than one type of endstone? It would add some variety to the End, which is the only dimension where only one type of block makes the ground. It would allow to keep the yellow endstone fore nostalgic people, and add other colors, for example pale green. I would like pale or pastel green because we don’t currently have any block of this color in the game. I don’t think colored end stone blocks should generate in chunks, I would rather see different areas / islands / biomes and why not some zones where they are blending together like paint.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Anyway, here are pictures of what other end stone colors could look like. I compared white and green variants to the original.<br><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/gQ_VXN-7BVFxS-L899gsUg.png\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/SOkFgBkEOrrhftF2PAr09Q.jpeg\"></p>",
