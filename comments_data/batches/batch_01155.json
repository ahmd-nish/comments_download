        "body": "<p>While testing village layouts in Creative Mode (Bedrock Edition), I discovered a consistent pathfinding issue that affects villager behavior. Specifically, villagers struggle to enter buildings when the ground outside is made of grass path blocks. Even with open doorways and direct access to workstations or beds, they often stall or wander aimlessly near the entrance.</p>\n\n<p>After some experimentation, I replaced the grass path blocks with stone blocks — and the change was immediate. Villagers began entering buildings reliably and interacting with their POIs as expected.</p>\n\n<p>This suggests that the AI may be miscalculating the block height transition between grass paths (which are slightly lower) and standard full blocks like stone or wood. The subtle “lip” created by this height difference might be interfering with their pathfinding logic.</p>\n\n<p>This issue is especially problematic for players trying to build living, immersive villages using vanilla tools. Since grass paths are the default aesthetic for village roads, this behavior breaks immersion and functionality — and it’s not obvious to most players why villagers are failing to behave correctly.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this insight helps identify and resolve the issue. A fix would go a long way toward improving villager reliability and restoring trust in core survival mechanics.</p>",
