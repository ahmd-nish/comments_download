One thing Mojang could do to add more life would be small bugs that are more like particle effects. Firefly lights in mods add all sorts of life with no additional mobs, seeing \"birds\" way up in the sky with the clouds (but no interactions), random ripples on source block surfaces, there are ways to add phantom signs of life or movement without more mobs that players could then adjust as per their system abilities. I do lean however on the idea that larger mobs should have some sort of purpose or mechanic added, bats drive me bonkers as they don't really add much much, even if they dropped random seeds or rotten flest if a player is close and spooks them from roosting would be handier.&nbsp;</p>",

A cool solution would be if you could apply the ceramic shards TO the golem. it would mean that this golem would be unique in all of Minecraft, which would instantly personalize it and make it more special to the player. And because of that, all the ceramic shards you find would be exciting, thinking about how you want to decorate the golem, rather than throwing all the extras in a chest after grinding for a golem for an hour.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, I think having it be a fighting mob is unnecessary and redundant&nbsp;since we already have dogs and axolotls(cute btw). Instead it would be cool if they had a unique function. If the iron golem is like a villager guard, then the ceramic golem would be like an ancient village builder. It would be able to create ceramic tiles inside itself and build a wide variety of prefab structures similar to villager houses. I really think it ties in the idea of adding lore that's up to interpretation, it would incite exploration, and would be fun for technical players to work with(for ceramic farms and things). I know its a weird idea but thats the charm of minecraft, all the quirky and strange things that you can discover</p>",

Having over 1,000 HP is ridiculous That's already 1000 times more health than the ENDER DRAGON (100 hearts or 200hp). You'll pretty much break a diamond sword on full durability without strength or other modifications such as sharpness and unbreaking. Also, it seems lame that it would drop diamond armor with prot 4 (how is it relevant anyways besides the ridiculous crafting recipe?).</p>\n<p>Also, armor made from the dropped material being 5 times stronger than diamond is way too overkill, even surpassing netherite, it even surpasses some modded armor that goes beyond diamond. Although you said it \"can burn in lava\" I assume you meant it doesn't which netherite already doesn't burn. With gold's abundance in the nether, the extra durability would make it more overkill than it practically is already.</p>\n<p>Overall, this idea is best saved for a datapack or mod as many people would be piling questions to Mojang. Not to hurt your feelings or anything. Mojang Studios is more likely to use feedback that seems more \"realistic\" to them (doesn't have to be real life realistic because it's just a video game).</p>",
