Mostly mending needs to be fixed, it completely removes the necessity to mine and it is quite unfortunate. Though I do not think a \"one time fix\" is a particularly fun enchantment to get as you do everything to achieve it to loss it all at once. I also do not think they should remove the ability for your tools to break, mostly for early game clutter moving into late game consistency. And lastly I do not think enchanted items should cost more to repair as it should not be looked at as a detriment to have an enchantment.<br><br>Here is what I suggest. Make it so the mending enchantment now solely removes the increasing repair costs. Super simple. We can keep most mechanisms in place, the mending enchantment is still the go-to, to keep your enchanted item around (especially if you find your enchantments from chests).&nbsp; And it will bring meaning back to mining. This change would be an elegant fix to the problem and very intuitive for the player who has spent any time on an anvil with out compromising the current structure of the game.&nbsp;</p>",

As stated in the minecraft wiki <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fire\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Fire</a>&nbsp;as of 12/04/19 Fire will ignore inflammable blocks and works off a radius based system. I think fire could be easier to predict if it worked off a line of sight/ distance based system. in this case fire could be easier to prevent giving players easier ways to build fireplaces and fire based builds while still letting fire be something to be careful about!</p>\n<p>Smoke has been added to campfires and small bits of smoke particles can be seen floating from fire, In my opinion it should stay like this as smoke would be really hard to implement into the game. Similar to the light level problem in survival this would limit peoples builds. Places in survival must be lit up or monsters will spawn, meaning you cant have a dark build without monsters, like this players would have to make all there builds have some form of hole for smoke meaning fire couldn't be used underwater or in air tight builds.</p>",
