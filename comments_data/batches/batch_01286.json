People evidently like these two and would like to see them more given the commercial success of all the merch featuring them, requests for them to be included in other Minecraft games such as Story Mode, Dungeons, Earth and even requests for them to be included in crossover games such as Lego Dimensions and Super Smash Bros.

If you know otherwise please provide solutions to each of these questions (or a download link to a full-functioning api—not the scripting api because that pales in comparison—that has all of these features, something I could not find online):</p>\n<p>1. Ingame NBT editing with commands or an api (the ability to change texts on signs, tool, armor, and weapon enchantments and durability, stuff inside chests and other tile entities, etc.)<br>2. Scoreboard features (similar to java), variable manipulation, timers (storing data into variables, teams, player event tracking, etc.)<br>3. Custom GUI functionality (buttons, inputs, variable displayers, etc. I fell like this isn't as important as the other two but is definitely visible in many marketplace maps)</p>\n<p>Thank you for commenting, but I do not know if you haven't done enough research to understand what I am referring to or know of an api openly available to the public that can do all of these things. Looking at your profile you certainly know what features I am talking about that are in Java but not in Bedrock. I am talking about Bedrock, not Java edition. The reason for creating this post is because I feel like Mojang is holding special things and tools back from their development community and only offering them to people who enter into a business partnership with them. They took a step in the right direction with the scripting api, but they ought to push forward with giving the community more control over the game.</p>",

Marketplace developers use more than just pre-world NBT editing in their maps; I've seen sign text change before in specific maps while the map was running, which is obviously NBT editing. I couldn't find the specific map I am referring to on the marketplace, but the video I watched on it is here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNiILbxuo8U\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNiILbxuo8U</a>; position of the chat and other specific features reveal that this is Bedrock and not Java. Servers contain the GUI I'm referring to. Since you say you do have experience in developing maps for Bedrock, I would like to see your view on how something like this is done while the map is running, because that is part of what I am asking for here in this post. You could also post a few links if you want. Features like this are what make me skeptical that Mojang is holding back specific tools from the ordinary community and providing them to partners exclusively.<br><br>Also, the notifications for this page are definitely a bit annoying; I haven't gotten a single email about any comments on this post even though am following it. lol</p>",

        "body": "<p>For servers I believe you are right, to my knowledge they use third-party software to expose lots of extra functionality that you could never get in singleplayer or with mere behavior packs/commands; equivalent to the types of plugins you would see on java servers. Although I can't speak too much on their relationship with microsoft, I know that at the very least they enable extra things like purchasing nonsense in-game (probably related to the GUI you mention).</p>\n<p>As for the map in that video, that guy was too painful to watch haha, but based on your description, my guess is that the signs are simply cloned in from existing templates.</p>\n<p>I found the map on the marketplace (called Restaurant Simulator - Head Chef). Fortunately the command blocks were predictably at (0, 0), and there I indeed found templates for the signs.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/eIQ84Pc0F4JBBv2xRAj2KA.png\"></p>\n<p>(sorry about the colossal image, I'm pretty sure you can't resize them on this mess of a website)</p>\n<p>Finding the actual /clone command itself was a bit more complicated. The upgrade button summons a zombie horse. After some time, I found a chain of command blocks labelled \"upg listener\" somewhere. It makes zombie horses check a block beneath them (at the bottom of the world, seemingly representing the current status of the upgrade), then activates another chain.</p>\n<p>And that is where I found it, the commands to clone the new sign, remove experience from the player, and so on.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/6EEoTOEa0rNEn_zA8BDiww.png\"></p>\n<p>Aha! Theory right, with a bit of poking. You are very right that mapmakers would love NBT access and other things, but alas we must put up with convoluted workarounds.</p>",

I had a feeling cloning might have been involved after I submitted my comment, but I thought it was more nbt editing than anything else. I suppose then what I'd be saying now is just that Bedrock edition tools are extremely limited compared to Java, not that ordinary players have any less tools than paid developers on Windows 10. Still, doing this stuff on consoles is extremely limited, since you can't see the world files (probably for control reasons and to block achievement hungry players from cheating) or make servers; regardless, I would prefer better tools over achievements.</p>",

I post and watch minecraft videos on youtube. so recently I was arguing with a friend of mine. politics obviously, but what did this mean? big politicians don't generally listen or tell the truth, even in some cases not doing something entirely. well when I first played minecraft it was pretty small i played on 360 and generally had a good time. but now that minecraft is big, im honestly afraid that it can't hear us fans anymore. about a year ago a vote was held at minecon. \"Witch biome gets a little boost\" well the jagged cliffs won and was meant to bring goats and better snow to minecraft, simply this did not happen in the next update (1.15) or the one there after (1.16). the community was lied to here and i feel very strongly minecraft should upkeep its word. but in addition of being lied to, the minecraft community is straight ignored. one of the largest things talked about is minecraft cave update. now i mentioned the youtube platform, but there are many more sources for people to talk to people on. and i feel it crucial that these people are heard too. Minecraft is big and got me through tough times when nothing else would have helped. minecraft is in a way a leader in my way of thinking, and as i have looked to minecraft as basically a role model. i'd like to see minecraft become that role model&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;thank you all for reading</p>",
