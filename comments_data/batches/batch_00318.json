Ethoslab has being doing this a lot both in his singleplayer world and on the HermitCraft server.

Additionally, the bound-to-player mechanic seems really annoying and creates a lot more problems than it solves, in my opinion.<br><br>Besides, it would logically make more sense for the dispenser itself to be teleported, though I seriously doubt that kind of behavior would be useful.
