Also a shadow would weaken (but not cancel) dehydration. During night time there's cold on deserts so maybe the player would be threatened by freezing?

Some reason should have developed why players aren't thirsty in the nether. Maybe the nether portal has some magical powers that cause this? Maybe it drains blod in players wain's and the appearance of their skin will chance to a new variant: scorched skin.

It's not as much a technical way that could interrupt the old game mechanics and cause unbalancing (and therefore need long considering before it could be accepted or rejected). No, it's a background story. A cool moment, think it as a new cool new texture for an old block, or something comparable. We all love stories. This could be one way to shake up the community a bit and give the update more viewers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If the player watches the standing up minizombie the camera would zoom in and show a closeup of the zombies face when it uplifts it's dagger... before it charges to you!

So it would be fantastic to be able to play this mode on the go, with&nbsp;cross-platform&nbsp;play, or the various other features that bedrock provides over java. Hopefully, this mode does not get forgotten.\"&nbsp;<br><br>i agree with this, minecraft bedrock is good and all (same with java), but to make it kind of more interesting, they should add Hardcore and Spectator mode to this version of Minecraft, ive been told to random people that i should use the hard mode difficulty like if it was hardCORE mode but to be honest, it dont really give me that challenge feeling cuz i sometimes play my survival worlds in hard mode. i know adding this to bedrock wont happen tommorow or whatever, but i hope someday it comes next year or idk...</p>",

I know because since I can remember I know minecraft and I only played on ps4; and of course their buttons are many but not enough, instead in java they have more than 40 keys to choose from and it is not much of a problem so I ask them to sacrifice a button on xbox or nintendo but on ps4 the thing is easy to fix. The pad in the middle of the controller is used to see the effects you have with you. If you delete that window and put it in the inventory would be a free button, that could be used to switch to the secondary hand as the f in java, I do not know how it would be on xbox but I think it will not be so difficult. Then the spectator mode. I don't know if it is difficult to code it but I don't think it is a big deal and also the hardcore mode that is very easy to do in my opinion. <strong>Please don't ignore this message, it's very important for me that you read it.</strong> I also thank you to your minecraft team that literally marked my life and I wish you all the best of luck.</p>\n<p>also add the combat update because a bedrock pvp is not the same as a java pvp well I'm leaving because I cant write anymore</p>",

Also, from watching a video about Minecraft Developer edition, if you press F2, you go into \"spectator mode\" and I found that really interesting. By the way, the developer version was 1.16.0.51, so developers have been keeping this a secret for a while. And using universal Minecraft editor, the earliest version I tried was 1.11.0.9, so developers have been keeping this a secret for a VERY long time. There is no evidence of hardcore mode in bedrock, but I would like to see both hardcore and spectator mode officially added.</p>",

For instance, a creator could release a world-gen pack themed around halloween, complete with custom halloween biomes with spooky halloween tree structures, and the beauty of it being a world-gen pack, is that no two experiences will be exactly the same (unless the seeds are the same), compared to a regular custom map..</p>\n<p>Assuming it was fully data-driven, it could allow the creation of worlds that are similar to legacy console worlds, super-flat worlds, worlds that consist of an endless forest and so much more.

I get it was left behind due to bedrock but that is besides the point as we cannot transfer our 360 worlds easily to the one.

Even my little cousin wishes he could do this.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s just the world transfer issue. Not the fact that ps4 did get more updates. I do understand that mojang was pushing the bedrock edition and that’s why it ended legacy the way it did, but the least they could do, after saying no more updates and continuing to update (small update and bug fixes yeah). But come on.. it’s possible. Don’t let down a part of your community just because. I myself am obsessed with legacy edition. But the fact I play on Xbox the most, it’s unfair I can’t have 1.13 At least.. if mojang goes all out and ports the ps4 versions update (1.14), and MAYBE reenlists the Xbox one edition, that’d be… amazing. </p>\n\n<p>I hope my vote counts, don’t let me down mojang.</p>",

This should definitely be possible, at least on Legacy Xbox One. I presume Legacy Console uses a very similar codebase across all platforms, so you could easily use PS4's update data. Not only that but Legacy Xbox One had an update this year, so it's not like you can't update the game today. I haven't really played a lot of Legacy Console, but there are still people and communities that love playing Legacy Console, just like how there are people who love playing on older Java Edition Versions</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To give the people who play on Xbox One and Nintendo Switch one last, final send off, would be a dream come true for all the people that still play those versions. This would be pretty safe to do so now as well, because Bedrock is far ahead of Village and Pillage by 6 major updates. In my opinion, you have nothing to lose by updating these Editions of the game. Think of it like Base Game Versioning, but for Consoles. This is something Console Players can only get by playing old marketplace maps (Which has its own set of issues which I won't go into)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please Mojang, Microsoft or whoever makes these decisions. I ask that you heavily consider this. In all seriousness, what could possibly go wrong by giving Xbox/Switch players one, final content update? You would be doing more good then bad today, and I guarantee you will be praised for making such a great decision.</p>",

These newer consoles are more than capable of handling updates beyond 1.12, so it doesn’t make sense why they were left behind. The PS4 got the Village &amp; Pillage update (1.14), so why not bring the Xbox One and Switch up to the same level?</p>\n<p>I get that Bedrock is the main focus now, and it’s awesome that it brings cross-platform play and other features, but there’s still a dedicated community that loves the legacy console editions. These versions offer a different experience that many players still prefer. It feels unfair that those who stuck with these versions are missing out on content that’s available on other consoles.</p>\n<p>Updating Xbox One and Switch to 1.14 would ensure parity across all legacy consoles and give players a sense of closure. It’s not just about having the latest content—it’s about making sure everyone who plays on these consoles has access to the same features. Plus, it would be a great way for Mojang to show that they still care about all their players, not just those who’ve moved to Bedrock or Java.<br><br>Let’s hope Mojang, Microsoft, or 4J Studios listens to the community and gives these versions the final update they deserve!</p>",

On one of the last few updates of Xbox One Console Edition they forced in the old Bedrock Edition boat crafting recipe where you need 5 wood planks AND a shovel where as it used to just be 5 wood planks (Java Edition never got this crafting recipe). This later changed in more recent versions of Bedrock Edition, removing the shovel from being apart of the crafting recipe. I'm not sure if this plagues any other Legacy Console but if it does I feel that it should be removed if they're all going to be updated to Playstations version of 1.14.

Especially with you redoing the new world generation, being able to label biomes and other points of interest is going to be critical for all of the bedrock players. I have a notebook I have to use if I want to play Minecraft because there is no way to record where something is. I have to look at my maps, see what direction I'm heading then go through my notebook to find the coords and get out there safely. It really needs work. Even just allowing us to rename the maps and have the name of the map show up would be helpful beyond belief. Thank you!</p>",

Pocket edition is not like the others in where the screen does not need to be centered to attack. You can hit something on the corner of your device view on pocket edition. However, if they add sweeping edge, pocket edition would be the only one that didn't have it, which would feel unfair to them. And, if they added it to PE, where would they put the recharge and slash across the screen? Since it's not required to center your screen to attack, they would not be able to use it unless they got it perfectly straight. Don't get me wrong, I would love sweeping edge, I have multiple mob farms, and go through multiple iron swords on each run. It's just the differences in attacking format would make it hard for the devs to add sweeping edge to bedrock.</p>",

It would truly make bedrock edition worlds much safer, and more of a guarantee that nothing crazy like that can happen in survival. This would also make the performance better on Bedrock. And for those who do want to access it, make it the same on Java to use commands to move it and you could also add a gamerule on the cheats section to toggle off the effect of the world border. This would truly improve the bedrock edition.</p>",

A similar gossip system to Java’s would help bring incredibly popular and needed parity with Java. Gossip system would help those who choose to play bedrock over Java with potentially better iron golem spawns and improve trading as well. Given that we bedrock players have the choice to play Java if we would rather, it would be great to feel like we at least have a shot at making equivalent farms and contraptions as Java. I feel it would be a little shortsighted to ignore this particular parity difference given how important iron is in the game. Please understand I love Bedrock Edition over Java and feel the bedrock game is drastically stunted by iron golem spawning.

Then after you have deleted your world then your achievements are deleted automatically or reset automatically okay but those rewards you have earn from achievements will not be lose because you guys have earn those rewards hardly this feature will interact all of you because if this new feature in achievements you can enjoy Minecraft bedrock more. what you think it's depend on you i gave mine idea Have a good day.
