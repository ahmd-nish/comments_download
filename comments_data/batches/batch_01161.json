If the geometry changes enough, the shader won't be apply to the geometry correctly. Even if you meant that it should be updated every time there's a change to a block, breaking or placing a block would cause a hang when the game finishes processing the change and tries to apply the new shader.</p>\n<p>Better question: Why can't we have screenspace raytracing like we did before the RenderDragon engine? It's still expensive performance-wise, but not nearly as much as world-space ray-tracing. The answer is: money, obviously. I'm guessing Nvidia has a contract with Microsoft for exclusivity; that would make Minecraft required to use Nvidia's RTX API, blocking capable hardware made by AMD, Intel, Qualcomm, and other GPU manufacturers. That drives sales toward Nvidia, away from its competitors.</p>\n<p>If this weren't the case, the other manufacturers would still need to provide APIs that are as easy to use and learn as the RTX API for Mojang to even consider going through the pain of supporting other non-Nvidia hardware.</p>\n<p>Note: I mentioned Qualcomm earlier. Their newest chips have more and better Tensor cores which would help a lot with realtime world-space ray-tracing. However, Nvidia boasts that its GPUs have cores dedicated to ray-tracing which likely gives them the edge over those that lack them.</p>\n<p>-- BinToss</p>",

The only problem is that minecraft will not allow this, which I personally think is stupid. I don't know if NVIDIA made a contract with microsoft when creating this that made Microsoft agree to forcing an rtx card, resulting in more money for NVIDIA as people would have to buy NVIDIA's newer generation as opposed to the cheaper gtx generation. This is all theoretical but I know for a fact rtx runs pretty well on a gtx.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Ok, let's get a few things straight for people who don't know what Ray-Tracing actually is.<br><br><span lang=\"en\">Ray tracing is <strong>a method of graphics rendering that simulates the physical behavior of light</strong></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en\"><strong>Ray Tracing does not explicitly require an RTX graphics card.</strong></span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en\">The difference between an RTX card and a GTX card is that RTX cards have specialized \"RT-Cores\" designed specifically to accelerate the calculation of Ray-Traced lighting in games that take advantage of them.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en\">They, however <strong>are not required for ray tracing</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span lang=\"en\">Many rendering engines, such as Blender, Use something called \"Software Ray-Tracing\" Which is the exact same math done by RT-Cores, but instead it's being run on ordinary GPU cores. This is inefficient, but if a graphics card has enough raw power, it can run Ray-Tracing off of GPU cores alone. In fact, every GTX 10XX Graphics card supports this form of rendering. There is an excellent youtube video by &nbsp;zWORMz Gaming that showcases the 1080TI running modern(ish) titles with RTX enabled at, admittedly low, but playable framerates.</span></p>\n<p><strong>HOWEVER</strong></p>\n<p>Because of when the GTX 10XX cards released, none of them fully support DX12, which breaks RenderDragon's Ray-Tracing. The only GTX card that could run RenderDragon natively without issues is the 1660 set of cards (1660 (super, TI))</p>",

There is no way to click on these icons like you would think you could to get information on why it is unavailable <br>After more online resurch than i would have wanted i find out it is only on windows 10. <br>I also find out that just a few weeks ago there was an accident in an update that alowed ray tracing on the series x that was shortly after removed. <br>So i find myself wondering why if the console is more than capable, it has been used as a tech demo, it has apeared on accident, the options are there in my settings and it does exist on windows 10 than why is there no talk about it coming to series x and why would they use mincraft with ray tracing as a way off showing off the console if there was and still are no plans to implement it into the game. <br>I feel like the raidio silence on this has gone on long enogh and its time we at least get some clarty on what is happening with this <br>Its starting to feel like we are being teased with a treat we will never get.. <br>Just like the super duper graphics. <br>I hope to hear something on this soon <br>Thank you <br>goodnight</p>",

Not everyone has the new ps5 or Xbox series X so no ray tracing and now i cant even enjoy minecraft since the update because everything looks vanilla again!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This way everybody could easily have their own custom shaders or share them with their friends, but also it would prevent shaders from being stolen and the marketplace being a mess. It would be a much friendlier solution that each player could their tailor to themselves.</p>",

Regardless, I'm sure the original 6 pattern limit was instated as a way to prevent lag. With more modern versions of the game and in my own testing with a base full of 10+ pattern banners, I never noticed a bit of lag. I believe there is a hard limit of somewhere around 16 layers which as OP has said, is probably around the limit of creativity where adding more doesn't really yield more varied banners.</p>\n<p>On the point of the pillager banner being unique and rare as it cannot be crafted in survival, it would retain its unique nature in that it has a different colored name that cannot be given in survival, so a replica, player created pillager banner would not be as special despite looking similar.</p>\n<p>I'd love to see this banner pattern limit raised so I don't have to rely on data packs to achieve something that is already technically possible.</p>",

Unfortunately optifine is like the only thing that allows for CEM, and some of my packs from when I did use optifine don't work for me anymore because of this. But enough about that, what I am trying to say is that yes it would be amazing if Mojang added CEM to Minecraft without needing a mod like Optifine. This would be another step to inviting endless creativity to everybody.</p>",
