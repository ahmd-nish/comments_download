I find Armour to be the common issue, but also some older packs that haven't been updated then lack custom textures and revert to the default, so it would help blend the packs when they lack something the others have.

I understand why you're all frustrated, but I just learned Minecraft did this and I want to explain why this is one of the BIGGEST improvements to Minecraft in a long time. OpenGL 3.2 came out about the time Minecraft was originally being developed. Minecraft was using legacy technology from day one. Over the years, the benefits of this newer technology has been completely inaccessible to Minecraft, those who make mods, etc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is certainly a rough loss for those who are unable to play anymore, but it would be too difficult to maintain two separate rendering pipelines just for people who have computers that don't support 10 year old graphics standards.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The benefits this brings is absolutely immense, it will open up many possibilities for shaders in the vanilla game, the possibilities are really endless. I can understand the frustration with this, but I understand the technology behind this, and I promise this is 100% the right decision for the game.</p>",

Shaders are available since OpenGL 2.0, and the ancient pipeline was basically deprecated then, if not in 1.5. Rendering of Minecraft is extremely simple and does not require features even from 15 years ago. And what isn't simple, like shaders, are still available since 2.0, and were part of OptiFine for a while now.<br>But, perhaps Minecraft developers are now utilizing those new features for the betterment of player experience? Let's see. They haven't added native shader customization, it still requires mods, so that's that... The game also runs slower than it did 5 years ago... Graphics look the same, just with better textures (which don't require a newer API)... And now a bunch of old machines cannot even run newer versions of Minecraft at all because their drivers weren't updates in a while. I'd call it a win! For the kingdom of satan, of course.</p>",

Mojang are by far the worst developers I've ever heard of, a 600 strong team that can barely force out a small update once or twice a year.
