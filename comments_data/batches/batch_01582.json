The boss will burn you if you get too close, so by splashing it with water, you can temporarily remove this burning feature, as well as greatly slow the boss down so you can then attack it.

And the appearance change one would make for interesting farms, where you would get scraplings to inhabit the ore you want and then kill it. This would make auto farms for ores, and would be interesting. They'd have to pack one heck of a punch though if this is the way they'd go with this, say like 3-7 hearts to an unarmored player, and maybe make them aggressive to each other, that would be an interesting mechanic, it would feel very much like vanilla and would work well especially given the upcoming update.</p>",
