Don't get me wrong, I loved Technoblade, but I think something smaller to give support for him would be best. Mojang already added a techno pig to the launcher and I think that may be enough. I especially dont like that it would have other Dream SMP member things like a Dream mask and Philza arrows. For technoblade it makes sense we add something into the game but for the others not so much. If we were to add them I think we might as well add other content creators as well, otherwise it would be unfair. I think it would be a great mod though.</p>",
