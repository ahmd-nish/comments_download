Following the theme of this biome, we could add waves to the ocean in general- and with that, maybe some things like shells or scutes or even ingots, could wash up. I think it would also be cool if the new villagers were actually a new merfolk mob, and they traded with pearls that you could find in giant clams that sort of function like shulker mobs. To make things easier, you could have these clams in overworld oceans and have the Deep Clams give rare black pearls, or just place them in the deep. This post made me super inspired and now I'm disappointed that they didn't do this in the Ocean Update.</p>",

Where wherever you spawn the wither he'll kill everything around him in a large area, turning the grass grey, with a new tainted soil block. The trees lose the leaves and the bark turns black. This is also a way to add the wither flower into the over world. There would be a variant zombie in the area that's also grey and dusty. And if the wither attacks a village it makes them all dusty too, leaving charred ruins.</p>\n<p>This biome also has a rare chance to spawn on it's own in the over world. when it spawns on it's own there would also be new cave generations. Such as circular pits that drop down, like craters, as well as craters. Perhaps underground in the caves Netherack would spawn occasionally like granite or andesite. There would be a higher chance to find a abandoned, portal, and village ruins with dusty village zombies would spawn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I don't know if this is possible.... but to have it be cloudier above the biome itself. perhaps having that be a way to see it from a distance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think that it would create a nice contrast against temperate areas that are very green. And it would almost be like a bit of lore as well (adding to the dramatic power of the wither).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm sorry I feel like I'm piggybacking. Generally I think that a wasteland biome would create some really cool contrast with the biomes around it. And I love the mushrooms. love me some mushrooms and red sand.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>Very good ideas! I think each one could be their own post, because it seems to me they could work even if a deeper underground dimension was not implemented.</p>\n<p>I think there should be a different way to get there than going down a ladder for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Steve has to rely on someone else long ago/world generation to get there, which means he can't make the passages wider, or change them in hardly any way.</li>\n<li>Older worlds upgrading will have to explore new chunks to be able to get down.</li>\n<li>Since this place would be a different dimension, there would need to be a loading screen while you transition from one part of the ladder to the other. This would make going up difficult because you have to make sure you keep holding \"forward\" when the loading screen ends. (unless they could figure out a way to switch dimensions without loading screens, which would mean having chunks from both dimensions loaded at the same time...)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An alternative is this:</p>\n<p>The player crafts a diamond chisel (stick + diamond). They use a chisel on a bedrock block, and it becomes a partially damaged bedrock block, and the chisel is destroyed. They repeat this 63 more times, each time, the bedrock getting more damaged, until it becomes cracked bedrock. Cracked bedrock may then be mined with a diamond pickaxe, and is either destroyed, or drops a cracked bedrock block which someone can come up with a use for.</p>\n<p>When the last bedrock block has been destroyed, the player can jump out of the world, and their feet will land on y=-2, so they are standing entirely beneath the bedrock. At this point, they will be blind to everything because of a fog, so a floor doesn't even need to created in the overworld, just a collision plane. Upon contact with this plane, they are sent to the underground dimension (presumably with a loading screen), and they find themselves with their head between y=254 and y=255 (same x and z), and their feet on y=253. The entire top layer of this dimension is the entire bottom layer of the overworld, so they can faintly see (because of the fog) the bedrock they broke just above their head.</p>\n<p>The fog would hover around all bedrock layers in the overworld, underground, and nether.</p>\n<p>So the player doesn't start suffocating when they enter the underground, the second-to-top layer of the undergound would be a transparent block, maybe \"bedrock gas\", \"bedrock glass\", or something that breathes like a liquid, so they will start suffocating if they stand there too long.</p>\n<p>Once there, you just have to dig down.</p>\n<p>To get back up, you just have to reach where your feet are standing on y=255, and you will be teleported to the overworld standing on y=-1 at the corresponding x and z. You won't get teleported back down by standing there, so you would have to jump out of the hole, and back in if you wanted to go back down, similar to how you have to exit and enter a nether portal to go back through.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Noobly20932 chunks are already cubic, that is, each \"chunk\" is 16 16x16x16 sections grouped together. The real challenge would be organizing them into cubic region files and implementing 3-dimensional world generation. That would be really cool, though - to see a ravine so deep the bottom doesn't even render because it's too far away.</p>",

I would just ask that the dimension be made to feel more like an extension of underground, rather than a new dimension. The more seamless it can fit with the overworld, the better.</p>",

Well it's the closest to the sun but it's not as hot as Venus, in a nutshell Venus is defying physics lul, also the gas giants aka planets farther than mars \"Jupiter Saturn Uranus and Neptune\" are mostly composed of helium, so standing on them is like standing on quicksand, aaaand... Fourth our moon isn't the only moon in the solar system, all the other planets (except Venus and mercury) and surprisingly Pluto top have moons, Jupiter has around 67 moons and most of them are invisible to the naked eye, say...

I think the deep dark oceans should have angler fish, goblin sharks, and some other scary underwater mobs. The way to get to the deep dark ocean should be that there is a darker/black spot in the ocean a hundred or so blocks away from land and you have a choice to go down there since if you were pulled down into the deep dark ocean that would most likely scar a little kid who wasn't planning on getting scared. I think once you get down to the deep dark there are little caves with air so you don't drown if you forgot a water breathing potion or something, but stay in pocket of air too long and something dark could come and get you. There would be chests full of valuable items in the deep dark ocean, mobs that drop special stuff, etc., but since there are rare/good rewards being down in the deep dark would be really challenging, nearly every mob that spawns there is hostile, there is little to no light, and your struggling for oxygen (unless you have a conduit or water breathing potion of course). Sorry if that was a bit long but I just had to put all my ideas out there, I have more ideas but then that would make this comment way too long.</p>",

Having the deep dark oceans away from land would make it something exiting to venture too, and new players wouldn't accidentally stumble upon then early on in their worlds as well. Making it a struggle to stay down in the deep ocean with more hostile mobs would certianly make it more intimidating (possibly higher spawn of trident drowned?)! I'm also realizing that if you die deep down, your stuff will also spread out further along the top of the water. Could possibly also have some overhanging arches above the hole that could \"catch\" some items, making it more of a struggle to get all your items back.</p>",

Would love to see some great detail in these trees as well, and maybe the occasional fallen tree (like in pocket edition forests) or dead tree. Probably better to keep it as a pretty rare biome to insinuate the degree to which it is endangered, and making the trees take a long time to grow from saplings/pine cones. Redwoods would be the only deciduous-coniferous cross in the game as well. The same wood and leaf type could have three distinct shapes (as ancient pines &amp; pines already do) to represent giant sequoias, dawn redwoods, and coast redwoods, representing three different extremely rare forests.</p>",
