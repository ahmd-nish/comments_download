        "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides, there's not much you can upgrade towards when you reach Netherite in terms of tier. Having more armor slots would be overpowered, and so would having any more mining speed or strength. Updating the enchantment system and magic as a whole in Minecraft to add more varied steps to advancing your gear and character should be their next step. Tiers in Minecraft are simple and straightforward, and they should stay that way, in which case adding more high-end tiers would be pointless. The magic system should be what you use to spice everything up, rather than just pilling up the game with tiers. Just think about this; you upgrade to the highest-end base tier through the Nether, which fits the theme of the updated Nether quite well, then you expand your gear through the late-game using magic, possibly with mechanics heavily related to the End that allow all of the variety I'm talking about. This would work perfectly with the idea of the End being the final phase of progression in the game while still opening up a lot of possibilities for players. It would add a sort of sensible yet still completely arbitary progression line between the Overworld, Nether and End, with the Nether being a sort of \"underworld\" dimension that is still habitable and therefore has the highest end base tier, and the End being the final accomplishment and therefore opening up late-game possibilities that didn't exist in any form before.</span></p>",

It would look like a small simple room at the surface, but the more you explore the halls you find that it is a whole complex of rooms full of ideas, plans, lists, and pictures written in paper and in map/exclusive paintings, until it reaches the deepslate layer. When it reaches the deepslate layer, it will always end in a giant cave, and a large cylinder will extend from the room higher up into the cave. This cylindrical room has a gaping hole at the very bottom but a narrow walkway along the perimeter. Below the walkway is a ladder that extends down into the cave, but stops in midair. Of course this is very specific and is probably too similar to strongholds, but I was thinking about something along the lines of a woodland mansion, where you are exploring these dark rooms.</p>",

You're not meant to make farms for the Warden. I doubt it would ever spawn in a way that allows you to use Redstone to farm it, and I doubt you'd be able to build such huge contraptions in the Deep Dark without it detecting and killing you. For once, stop thinking about the Warden's drops. They declared a thousand times that the Warden is meant to be a natural disaster that you stealth around to avoid. It's meant to bring the horror of the first night to veteran/late game Minecraft player's and to a different level and theme. Being able to farm it even if you aren't directly killing it absolutely breaks that purpose. If it will drop anything, it will be a trophy item, and they're not even sure about that.</p>",

Deepslate looks fascinating in the new caves (at least with Dripstone caves) and it creates a very interesting and grim atmosphere that would also perfectly fit with the Deep Dark biome. It also has a ton of building variants (much more than andesite or granite) so it is great to have huge quantities of it. As for the mining speed, this is also a cool gameplay feature; if you go below Y=0, the stone becomes much harder. Insta-mining is not essential. I don't see how that is unnecessary inventory clutter. It is necessary because of what I said above, and it is not even inventory clutter. If you're mining below Y=0, you don't need to take any regular stone with you, and you only find 2 stone types (Deepslate and Tuff), so there is less clutter than mining above Y=0. Besides, when was inventory clutter such a major issue that could cause the developers to remove entire blocks or change entire gameplay aspects?</p>",

It may be very good for building and, if removed, some players might be so sad they stop playing. If deepslate is removed, there will actually be MORE clutter because less ores will be mined, less houses will be built fast, and also bedrock is not very far down, because deepslate REMOVES the bedrock layer and puts it further down.</p>",
