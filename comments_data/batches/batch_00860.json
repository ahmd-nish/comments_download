If a heart was lost each time you died, then as the game gets harder (Nether/End), you would die more as you would have less health, ultimately spiralling. Therefore, I would suggest that an option be added where no hearts were lost, but there was a death cap, so that you could only die, say, ten times before the world locked you out. That way you don't run the risk of fighting the Ender Dragon with a 2HP maximum.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I also think your contributions to this site as a whole, both in suggesting ideas and in providing reasonable feedback on some of the posts, and indeed on encouraging other users to think carefully about whether what they have to say is a worthwhile suggestion, are truly noble and it's appreciated that new contributors like me know there are people who will give genuine consideration to their ideas instead of just upvoting whatever has a good title or whatever their mate posted</p>",

I am indeed talking about the background music, the music discs would not be necessary because, as you pointed out, the song title is already displayed. In fact, maybe a better idea would be to have a similar system to the one that displays the title of music discs, except it could be toggled by gamerule and off by default.</p>\n<p>If clients have the music muted or no song is playing, the command should do either do nothing or give an error message, maybe something like \"No music is playing\".</p>\n<p>Resource packs might be a problem, but I think that if someone is trying to use the /song command to identify the background music, they probably aren't using a resource pack anyway. If someone does try to use the command while also using a resource pack, I'm sure there is a solution. Maybe the command could output the name of the song that the resource pack is overriding, maybe it could search the resource pack files for the name of the song that is currently being played (if that's possible - to be honest I'm not quite sure how resource packs work) and display that, or maybe you'd just get an error message, something like \"This command does not work with resource packs\".</p>\n<p>As for command blocks and the rest, I know it is possible for commands run in command blocks to behave differently from those typed in chat. For example, the /help command, when typed in chat, displays a list of commands. But in a command block, you just get a quirky message. So&nbsp;I think it would be possible to make /song&nbsp;work differently for command blocks, server consoles and functions. I don't know&nbsp;what it would do - maybe it would just be an invalid command. I don't really know about functions and client-server interactions and stuff like that, but I don't think this aspect is really an issue.</p>\n<p>Hopefully all of the above makes sense and I haven't misunderstood or overlooked anything. There's a good chance I misunderstood something, because I don't know much about the technical side of things. I just thought the command would be nice to have.</p>",

The closest you can get to that in vanilla right now is to just remove entire region files, that are like 512x512 blocks across i think, not vary good in many cases, or use 3rd party programs like MCEdit or those server plugins. Even tho those usually have bigger feature sets, they are sometimes slow to update, and you might for other reasons not want to run modded, so yes, it woyld be quite nice to have some basic built in funtionallity for that. Maybe even haveing, removing chunks, and mark chunks for repopulation, be seperate commands, and having a gamerule like \"spectators generating chunks\" for all players, as would be even more powerfull, both for mapmaking and for server owners.</p>",

Otherwise, one could use a command like /data modify entity @e[type=zombie,limit=1,sort=nearest] AngryAt set from entity @e[type=piglin,limit=1,sort=nearest] UUID. However, one could only set a single target this way. The team functionality has so many shortcomings that can't be relied on to make epic fights between mob groups and even if teams would be fixed, using /data would still be very cumbersome. Having a straightforward way to make mobs be hostile to each other would be a great addition to custom maps.</p>",

This is because with the data, the operator is able to examine data that can find who has been griefing or stealing. Essentially, the operator would not have to ask the owner for the data every time and could instead go ahead and take care of troublesome individuals on the realm. This is already possible for the owner and would be as simple as making it possible for operators one designated by the owner. This is a simple idea that could significantly help keep realms in order and keep control over disrespectful individuals.&nbsp;If it is still a concern for some reason that operators, (the people who take care of the realm), should not have these powers, then I would say that one could add further permissions allowing the owner to give access to the world data download, although I believe this to be unnecessary.</p>",
