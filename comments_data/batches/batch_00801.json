This idea seems more of a cause and effect rather than a story, and saying it's a story might make people dislike the idea as Minecraft is not an RPG and \"story\" makes it sound like you'd have to take quests to get to that point, which is the opposite of an open-world game. I love the idea of making decisions that would not only affect the world but also affect the voices! ^^</p>",

These mobs were not discarded; what happened is they're prioritizing which mob out of these ideas to add next based on the vote. This pretty much applies to all votes from after 2017. Losing biomes and mobs are just archived into the idea pile where they might go back to them later if they feel like they're worthy and urgent enough of an idea. The vote is just for prioritization. We're literally having the Swamp update in 1.19 and yet people are still confused. The short answer is they're neither discarded as a whole nor planned for specific updates, most likely. They still exist and have potential to come later, and I believe the Copper Golem particularly is one that we might see sooner given how popular it is and how Ulraf (a developer) said it could potentially have some connections to Archaeology if/when it's added (NO PROMISES).</p>",

To balance this out they could probably be weaker and slower than the original versions, taking less hits to take down. The sludge could be quite loud to step in as well, since it's sludge and is slimey and gooey, potentially making your footsteps louder by entering them. Yeah, that's all I have to say, good idea!</p>",

However, I still have an idea how it could be even better: First, the sculksensor can block to a range of 20 to check for the sounds (by filling them with crystals). Secondly, it would be cool if you could adjust the sensor to a certain type of noise (jump, run, build, build). I know that you can build this with a bit of technology, because it is output depending on the type of noise a redstone strength. However, with this idea I mean that he would only perceive some kind of sound. If these things could still be inserted, I think that would be quite revolutionary for the redstone story of minecraft. I'm really looking forward to the new update and can't wait to explore the new mountains and caves.\"</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;\">- Translated by&nbsp;Admin</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

This just sounds like completely random luck; it's the opposite of strategy. There is no fun in that. If there is a way to determine whether you're gonna find more or less of certain ores based on surface terrain elevation or roughness, then it would actually involve strategy. But even then, is that really necessary? There are many better approaches to different ore frequencies locally, namely like the approach of more Gold in Badlands. More things like this would definitely be more fun and strategic than just less or more of all ores as a whole in specific areas, even when this areas are determinable.</p>",

When it happens it's usually a very small patch of grass that's easy to ignore, or it's a smaller than usual yet nonetheless valid biome.

        "body": "<p>I do like the idea of the Warden is the source for sculkers, it gives another reason to not kill it, and mechanically it's new to have a hostile mob be important for a redstone component. Instead of dripstone, I think the Warden should have some sort of sonic attack, this would help against ranged combat and even could be a way for the Warden to affect players with only a block between them (wool being the odd exception). As for the sculk scanner, it could be an interesting add if it gives any mob, but the warden, the glow effect that can then be seen through walls. That would make it an interesting and useful block in my opinion, though I think your goal was another defense for the Warden.&nbsp;</p>",
