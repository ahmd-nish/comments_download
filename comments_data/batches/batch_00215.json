This would allow us to create custom biomes like cherry blossom forests, without the grass also being pink, or autumnal forests without the ground being orange or red or yellow. The main issue with this is that it would mean replacing the colormap system with specific color codes. Also, considering there are many other tinted foliage types besides leaves and grass, for consistency's sake, the devs might need to separate the color of every tintable foliage. It also would not allow for changing the leaf color of specific trees in a biome. If i wanted to have a biome where each tree was a birch tree with a random autumn themed color, I could not do that. So maybe there is a better way to do this. Maybe a new blockstate or tag for leaf blocks? I'm not sure.</p>",

Very similar to the Woodland Mansion - you buy a map to find it (spawns very rarely), it has mobs that are more dangerous than usual and you are bound to find treasure. The difference is that the Woodland Mansion is about adventuring in tight hallways and rooms, while the Lost World Tepui is about adventuring in an open space (save for trees).</span></p>",
