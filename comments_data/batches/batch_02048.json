        "body": "<p>Finally, a unique mob that punishes villager murder, As Iron golems were kinda easy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My way of seeing the bounty hunter Is that they're a human NPC, similar to the player. They have 20 HP and have a very complex AI. they carry Healing potions, as well as potions of speed, strength, and regeneration, and In higher search parties, they will wear Iron and ever so rarely Diamond armor. They could carry by choice a sword or axe for up close combat but either own bows or crossbows When far enough.</p>\n<p>This mob could drop 1-3 leather, their ranged weapon,&nbsp; 4-6 emeralds, 1-4 random positive potions and rarely their armor, and even more rarely their weapon... There could be a 15% chance they could also be using shields.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for search parties, you'll start to be ambushed by 1 or 2 while running around the area, minding your business. But If the bounty Is at It's peak, groups of 7 or even 11 will raid your home. They can open doors, target your pets, and even understand redstone, so survival will be difficult..</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, good Idea, dude.</p>",

Here's some other ideas.\n<br />1. Social interaction, villagers that cannot gossip will go insane due to loneliness.\n<br />2. Villager must have enough space, if a villager is trapped in a small cell and cant travel a certain distance from their bed or cannot be in direct sunlight they turn.\n<br />3. Biome dependency, if biome specific villagers are brought out of their biome they turn. Snowy villagers must have access to snow blocks etc.\n<br />4. Lack of jobs, maybe a nitwit is a villager about to turn. Villagers without a job or sense of purpose are more likely to become Illagers, or a villager will revert to a nitwit before completely turning as a warning that a condition is not being met.\n<br />5. Reputation, if your reputation falls to historic lows the village could turn on you.\n<br />6. Lack of iron golems or cats, if villagers cant \"play\" with their iron golems or cats they get depressed and become more likely to turn.\n<br />7. Water source, villagers have to have access to some sort of water source to drink.\n<br />I think there should be need to be multiple conditions unfulfilled for a villager to turn or a specific condition unfulfilled for a long time. This would discourage players from having trading halls that resemble jails. If you want to be able to trade you have to take care of your villagers and keep them happy or they will revolt against you.</p>",

If you really want OP features for the sake of OP features (despite balancing actually making games fun), then there are plenty of mods or add-ons that add OP features. This change would be healthy for vanilla Minecraft and would stop ridiculous trading halls while maintaining Villagers' usefulness.</p>",

Example: Mending was introduce to combat anvil repair costs, Mojang added mending and now it's op all of a sudden and now we have to change it. Sometimes i think mojang and it's community's version of \"game balancing\" isn't really fixing the problem but also creating more. Villager farms and breeders took far more time to invest into back then and now are only this powerful due to the Village and Pillage update which is nice because it's convenient, sure. But also created more problems because of that convenience. Before you put your \"game balancing\" hat on and you need to ask what kind of game this is and it's history. I fail to encounter anyone that can convince me that Minecraft's objective in the long run was always to focus on game balancing. Not to mention forcing players into a play-style which should be left up to the player. If what these people want comes from truth and then they turn around and make a mob farm then you completely lost the point and the argument. I am not catering to this hypocrisy riddled opinion based on ignorance especially when talking about something important like proper game design balancing. Not just another fix break band-aid fix like everyone proposes. It's pretty sad that at this point beta minecraft remains to this day the most balanced. Stripping all the eye candy away.</p>",

Just add durability mechanic toggle and we have a peace. mending is just like that toggle, it's turning off the durability mechanic making the game less grindy and you can actual play the game! Not wasting your entire gameplay to grind another material for great tool you already obtain, Or move a pair villager from 3000 blocks away. What a challengeful gameplay! You're very skilled player! you could Travel villagers from 3000+ blocks away! Are that gameplay what you enjoy? There's no skill required for durability. All you can do is have a lot of resource and time to grind or just turn it off with mending.</p>\n<p>Edit: if you really really really desperate player for exploring, add more value on the each biome! Give each biome exclusive useful mob or whatever useful or fun to encouñter it! Not taking other biome value and throw it to another biome.

When talking about Village and Pillage my main concern with it was the Fletcher being able to buy sticks instead of going Farmer and having your crops take time to grow. I wouldn't be opposed to nerfing this by removing the ability to sell sticks altogether. Not to mention anvil repair costs although that's a different rabbit hole in it of itself.<br>When it comes to having a challenging experience that's fine. But before 1.20.2 I'd argue that the game encourage you to accept a challenge because of how the zombie villager curing mechanics worked. You needed to be on Hard Mode otherwise your villager had a chance to die in the process and the best part was if you ever did anything cheeky like switch it to peaceful when a zombie took your gear after death, you would lose that gear the zombie picked up. These mechanics in my eyes pushed casual players into a harder experience and some players like me would opt to lock the difficulty on hard mode all the time as the downsides into complacency were too great to exploit changing the difficulty all the time. All for a few added benefits. Was it easier to gear diamond gear? Yes! But would it be the same difficulty if you had done it otherwise? That's the question I'm proposing. I love catch 22s like this in gaming because it exposes a fallacy in playing the easier difficulty and encourages critical thinking when actually playing the game.</p>",

So annoying when they just run around in circles and let other mobs hit them until they die.</p>\n<p>A nice little \"go away\" option in that click on and trade-upgrade might be nice too. The number of times they stick their face in front of what you're trying to build or trash is astonishing. You'd think they'd learn, but no, they watch their mate cop a set of stairs to the face mid-happy dance, then die, and the majority of them just stare at you and say \"hmm\" in a disapproving manner. If you're lucky, one at the back might adopt an \"I'm out\" attitude and leg-it for a while.</p>",
