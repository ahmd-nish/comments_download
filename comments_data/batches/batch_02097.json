Recently I changed my Java Minecraft username to \"ItsAFoxInABox\" but literally yesterday I got banned for 2 days for \"staff impersonation\" because there was a staff member called \"vvoxl\" aka Fox, although literally, everyone knew ItsAFoxInABox was NOT vvoxl's alt or connected to vvoxl whatsoever, and since I changed it about 13 or so days ago, I have to wait 17 days til I can! I feel it unfair, especially when I feel vvoxl and I was on generally good terms.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I agree with one of the users below's comments, how since your Xbox Gamertag is different it won't really matter. Of course, I do agree also with the fact that changing usernames constantly would be a hassle, but honestly, most people might just change it because they HAVE to. Shortening the time limit to yes, 2 weeks would be a big relief, and maybe if for security and hassle you could have a subtitle underneath or something that says \"previously known as so and so.\"&nbsp;</p>",

We thought about adding an under review column on the other side, but the feedback community really wanted a place where random ideas could filter to the top. (Before we all go down that path, please know I know the algorithm can be better. <strong>I know</strong>.)</p>\n<p>Due to current software limitations, we don't have the ability to create an \"announce-only\" or \"under review\" category that's read-only.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What you can do is use these links:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts?filter_by=planned\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Announced</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts?filter_by=not_planned\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Under Review&nbsp;</a>(ignore the name of the url, all you coders out there can clearly see we had to work with some hardcoded stuff when we changed the tags to fit the site)</p>\n<p>As always I feel compelled to remind people that the word announced is reserved for things <strong>announced during events or through minecraft.net</strong>. We don't make announcements of features here, and things stay announced until such time they are either released or the team asks us to change the status to no longer planned. (You can't really unannounce something. :)</p>\n<p>Under review is just that. It is not a promise of future features, only that it has been discussed by the team. It is not an announcement or promise of future features. Some things have been under review for quite a while. We do not promise updates (so please don't ask), but when we have them they'll be provided!</p>\n<p>That said you can always sort each category to see the ones relevant to that category. Hope that helps.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
