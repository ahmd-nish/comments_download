When I'm building with redstone, I often want to power a block quickly, and currently I have to place other blocks to do so. It would be very useful to have an item that allows you to right click a block to power it (even if it expends the item). I think a two redstone tick pulse would be ideal (because certain components don't respond to one tick pulses).</p>",

Blowing side could disable pistons.</p>\n<p>Placed underwater, fans could create bubble columns or even whirlpools. It would be similar to a copper bulb, in that redstone toggles it on and off.
