She received a notification about the announcement of the copper cape challenge on October 14. As neither of us received both messages, it is clear that the inbox does not always work correctly for Minecraft news and notifications. Neither of us have received our copper capes by Nov 19, while we are very quickly approaching 30 full days after the promotion had ended, despite the in-game notification promising that these capes would be sent out 20 days ago while it was still October. There are online communities full of comments about this issue, where those who used the in-game challenge method have yet to receive their cape. I hope this can be resolved for all players who participated in this celebration of the Copper Age Drop. The last possible time to use Cape Codes is apparently Nov 20 at 10am PT, and I would rather that this is resolved before then so I do not have to choose whose account I use my one code on and who goes without the cape they are meant to receive.</p>",

I read in another post someone said they contacted support and support told them that they could not verify that they had placed a copper golem.

Well, obviously, I didn't record placing the copper golem statue, the T&amp;C never said to, and now the support just tells me that because I can't prove I placed the golem, they won't give me the cape. I took a picture of the golem statue I placed during the event, but never moved, just in case (I did continue playing on that world though), and they say my screenshot isn't proof, so they won't honor it. And both times they've closed my tickets without allowing me to ask for a manager or ask how I'm supposed to prove I did the event. The event that never said I had to prove it in the T&amp;C. Mojang doesn't care about anyone on Bedrock. Not getting the cape is probably due to a bug they caused, and they'd rather just blow off their players than do anything to fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>",
