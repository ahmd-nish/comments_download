A solution would be to implement language barriers; if someone pays in Turkish Lira for example, the game should be in Turkish exclusively for that person (this will probably have problems in the long run though). Especially with the coronavirus, my local currency has dropped unimaginably. Minecraft is 23.95 euros, and it's 205TL in conversion, which is a lot.</p>\n<p>Someone else commented: \"No offense, but I think people of lower developed countries have way different problems to worry about (especially, when they can't afford Minecraft as it is now).\" - Please don't be so out of touch, just because Minecraft is expensive to us doesn't mean we can't afford food or shelter.&nbsp;</p>",
