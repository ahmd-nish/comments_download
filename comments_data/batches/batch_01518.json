They not very well known about and adding them can introduce them to more people. I personally did not know about the Cama's until I found a youtube video about \"Animals you don't know actually exist\" And the Cama was in this video. At first I thought this was a joke until 1 google search later I found that this was a real animal. It is actually so little known about that it's name is not even in the Spell correct dictionary since every time I type it's name in this very page it shows as a misspelled word. We have both parent animals in the game as of Snapshot 22w42a. So why not take that last 1 step. And more people in the world will know of the Cama. The OP already covered everything else so perfectly. But I would like to add that Unlike Mules real life Cama's are not sterile They can reproduce their own offspring.&nbsp;</p>",

Also, In real life, When a dromedary and a Bactrian mate, the result is just a bigger one hump, called a F1 hybrid. So maybe there's three types of camels??? These ideas were just me spit balling whatever I thought of real fast, but the main idea here is just a two humped camel variant. I imagine when this update comes out, I'm going to tame some camels right away, and I would just love two humped camels as well as one humped. I know a lot of other players have been asking for this as well. It gives it more diversity and life, and besides, wild Bactrian camels are CRITICALLY ENDANGERED! Just 1400 of them are left. Putting them in the game would not only give me and other players joy, create a more lifelike scenario, and bring more diversity to the camels, but help raise awareness for this species. Honestly, the only thing I want in this update is two humped camels. It's relatively easing coding to do, I ask you sincerely; Please Mojang. Add two humped camels</p>",

But there are possible to breed two closely related species, like horses and donkies, or lions and tigers. But that does not make them the same species.<br>But thou were referencing with horses are still different from this case, since the game switches between different&nbsp;<strong>races&nbsp;</strong>of horses, since there are really only one singular horse-species that became the domesticated horse.
