They could also settle around water holes like the way parrots are drawn to other mobs.</p>\n<p>It would be fun if some wild budgies could spawn blue or yellow (which would be rare) or some of them have more blue or yellow than others. Then you could catch some and breed them for certain colours. Most wild budgies would be green. Breeding them would be like breeding pandas.

On big multiplayer servers it can be extremely hard to get elytra, yet they've changed the game so drastically that they should be available. It obviously should still take a lot of work to get them and only after beating the dragon but they should be renewable. A phantom boss would be cool. I'd suggest some sort of grindy process to spawn it similar to spawning the wither where you have to kill mobs for rare drops to spawn it.&nbsp;</p>",

The boss could attack with very loud screams and cause negative effects by looking at the player with its eyes for a few seconds. When it reaches a low standard of living, it would call some normal phantoms to help it, they will be able to see even in the dust.\n<br />The Phantom boss would be a giant phantom with more details on the wings, including veins as green as its eyes. Being injured its wings would tear and spots of green blood would appear on its body.\n<br />Defeating it would drop many levels of experience, phantom membrane and a pupil of its eyes, which can be used to create a device to see very far away, even at night and underwater. A kind of telescope. \n</p>",

I personally don't know whether I like the idea of having the coelacanth being used as a source of oil for lamps though, since it's a rather rare animal and there are plenty of easier light sources, like torches and lanterns. but the potion of defence would be a really cool idea, and having it be obtainable via a deep-sea fish is a unique concept, and gives more reason to explore the depths, which is something that I am <em>always</em> for in this game!

Suggested tweaks: Web spinning would be similar to guardian beams, in that a thread can be traced back to the queen and that it takes time to create a cobweb on a block. She would have two attacks: a dropping or slashing one from her abdomen or legs and a pouncing or charging one that deals poison damage. At 2/3 of her original health, she would summon spider minions and accelerate web spinning. At 1/3, she would summon cave spider minions and accelerate her web spinning more.
