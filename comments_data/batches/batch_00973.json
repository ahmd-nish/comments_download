        "body": "<p>I agree to this. In real life, the oxidation of copper is a simple chemical reaction, of 2Cu + O2 -&gt; 2CuO, or 4Cu + O2 -&gt; 2CuO2. Water, or H2O, is a catalyst for this, meaning that water speeds up the reaction without being consumed in the process. If Minecraft is going for semi-realism, then this should absolutely be a thing, so here's my idea:<br><br>1.) Firstly, let's say that the odds of copper progressing a stage is 1 in 100, rather high, but good for comparrison purposes. IF a water source block is adjacent to the copper block, the odds should be increased to along the lines of 1 in 10, and lesser water levels should also have an increase in the chance, though not as much.<br><br>2.) Secondly, it's a similar case for the rain. The reason that the Statue of Liberty is a green color is because of the oxidation by&nbsp; rain, so they should absolutely raise the odds of copper oxidizing a state during the rain.<br><br>3.) Thirdly, going along the lines of a similar chemical reaction, I think there should be a way to de-oxidize Copper as well, as this could take use of copper's electrical properties. I purpose that if you place a powered redstone repeater going directly into the copper block, the effects of the oxidation will begin to undo themselves.</p>",

To kill themselves? Also, the achievement clearly states you have to poison a witch, not harm one. Even if a witch was an undead mob, which it is DEFINITLY NOT, undead mobs are immune to potions of regeneration anyway. So, the only real way to poison a witch is to throw a potion of decay at it, which, ironically, can only be found in witch huts in survival.</p>",
