        "body": "<p>Focusing specifically&nbsp;on tomatoes in Minecraft which are my number one favorite fruit (yes it's a fruit) in real life. Here is how I would add Tomatoes to the game.</p>\n<p><strong>Tomato Seeds</strong></p>\n<p>These seeds can be found in dungeons and treasure chest, but can also be harvested from a Tomato. Each Tomato can give you four seeds. Seeds can be planted and grow into Tomato Plant.</p>\n<p><strong>Tomato Plants</strong></p>\n<p>I don't think tomato plants should occur in the wild. They can, however, spawn in a farm. Tomato Plants can be a unique plant in the game in that it is a two block tall plant that can be planted, matured, and harvested. In its immature stage, it is a small seedling, but in its mature stage, it grows to two blocks tall. Tomato Plants can be harvested 4-6 times before they die and disappear to dust and will need to be replanted. Each harvest yields 4-6 Tomatoes with a 1 in 8 chance of producing a Rotten Tomato.</p>\n<p><strong>Tomato</strong></p>\n<p>The tomato can be eaten. Being a heartier food item I think it could be worth 2 Food Points. The Tomato can also be turned into seeds for replanting. Each Tomato yields 4 Tomato Seeds. 2 Tomatoes can be added to a Wooden Bowl to make Tomato Soup which gives you 5 Food Points.</p>\n<p><strong>Rotten Tomato</strong></p>\n<p>There is a chance that when harvesting tomatoes you get a Rotten Tomato. When eaten a Rotten Tomato can give you 15 seconds of Nausea. Rotten Tomatoes can also be thrown like a snowball and cause a half heart of damage. If you die from a Rotten Tomato you get a special death message. \"Consider Yourself Tomatoed.\" You can also craft Rotten Tomatoes by combining a Tomato with Rotten Flesh.</p>\n<p>That is how I would add Tomatoes in Minecraft.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

You can eat pieces of bacon faster than a pork chop but they restore the same amount of hunger as a raw pork chop (3 hunger points) and a saturation of 0.3 (half of a pork chop).

The \"burnt piglins\" might carry a netherite pole arm, this pole arm would behave similarly to a trident and could be used in melee combat or thrown. This would make the great lava lakes more difficult again and considering that there are no mobs residing in the lava, besides striders, this would be a wonderful way to add to the nether. With tridents being such usefull, and favored weapons among many players I think that adding a new type of trident-like weapon would be a major upgrade for the nether and minecraft overall</p>",

It could leave a trail of fire or blue soul fire type particles when thrown and ignite the target with normal or blue flames on impact, depending on what kind of enchantment was ultimately chosen by the devs. When thrown under or into water, instead of a flame trail there could be a smoke trail or soul particle trail, like the flames were being quenched by the water. Additionally, the enchantment could be mutually exclusive with Impaling or Channeling. (This would also give a chance to add a blue on fire effect for when you're lit on fire by soul fire. :P)</p>",

However, placing this item in a new block called an Easel which has it's properties shared by the armor stand in its physics. The easel ui has this features, a canvas section where you can expand it to the largest possible size of the painting by adding wool, and a palette which is used to hold paint buckets. To make a paint bucket, you need a water bucket and a dye in the crafting grid. In itself, it is useless until you place it in the easel ui.  Each bucket will have 16 units and 1 is consumed per pixel painted on the canvas. Finishing the painting would simply be just a click of a button called frame. This can be neat in multiplayer servers with art galleries from different users or for economy servers where people sell their paintings to other players.\n<br />Just late thoughts, the painting item will no longer be called a painting and it will just be called a canvas. To get the preset paintings, a new villager would be added called a painter/artist, he could also trade you emeralds for dyes.</p>",

The paint brush.

Let's say that I have lot's of white concrete, but I need black. I just place the white concrete down and paint it black using the paint brush and the black paint bucket in my off hand</p>\n<p>Thanks for your time reading</p>",

Create a block like the loom where you put in the materials you need to create the blank painting canvas. Have spaces to put all your dye colors for use to paint with. Also maybe a blending area to lighten or darken colors. Then just give you a blank dot matrix layout to work on a design with choice of sizes. Even be able to click a save project at work button so you don't lose it if you need to back out of the easel block. When you are finished with the design/painting. Click a Finish it or Seal it button and Bam! You've got a designer painting all your own. Maybe even put honey to another use and make it the sealant for the painting when finished. Also would be cool if you could choose canvas start colors like banners when initially making and different woods for different frame color choices. Thanks. Peace Out!</p>",

It also made for good gameplay. Would I spend the time, emeralds and iron to get all the stuff set up to do this? Under certain circumstances, it was a good investment, such as parts of the game where you could not obtain blaze powder, or in intentionally rescource-depleted worlds (such as skyblock).</p>\n<p>It was not overpowered either: For one thing, you needed to get your hands on a specific kind of potion beforehand, which is hard to do. Apart from the energy potion from witches and the extremely rare potion of invisibility from the wandering trader, there was not a whole lot of potions you could make with it. Also, it demanded some attention from the player to work.</p>\n<p>A possible use of the potions obtained this way would be to have more energy potions in preparation to going to the Nether first time, which would be usable but not overpowered. In later game stages, brewing stands would replace the need for the dripstone method.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the \"dripstone potion duplicator\" was usable, interesting, and not overpowered. It should be brought back.</p>",

I believe this is one of the most useful tools with the new update. Aside from making lava farms with it the drop stone in my option is pointless without this feature. I would please ask that you bring that back as I don’t believe it was OP as most people have mentioned you still had to work hard to build this farm by simply just getting all the potions which takes a good amount of time if you are just starting off. I would love to have this feature added back to the game making the gaming experience more fun!</p>",

It was really cool and it’s definitely a mid-late game thing to get all the cauldrons, potions, and dripstone to make, we can have all these renewable sources and more to come with renewable clay? However we can’t have potions? Please bring this feature back it’s a lovely and welcome feature to the game that makes sense and didn’t actually produce that much because, it took so long for the dripstone to renew the potion. In fact I thought this was a vanilla feature due to a unique sound affect when you tried putting the potion in after the dripstone was placed, it would evaporate the potion so players would have to put the dripstone in after the potion so there potion wouldn’t evaporate.</p>",

Again, it's labor intensive to harvest on a mass scale, so, the time you put in is a lot ... ALSO, you have to GO EXPLORING for drip stone caves ... which just adds to the \"to do list\" when building a base in a new world ... and most players don't even dabble in potions, since they take up a lot of inventory ... it's just a nice thing to have—another thing to farm and manage—for the players that actually care ... and brewing manually is faster if you need a lot of potions NOW ...<br><br>Turtle Master is the hardest component to farm, but how often are people using that?<br><br>Lastly, if you think it's overpowered, then LOWER THE CAULDRON FILL RATE FOR POTIONS to the point where it is not ...

As some comments below have stated, however, there should be no way to enhance a <strong>[Crossbow with Scope]</strong> any further; that means no new enchantments, and no base enhancements like improved accuracy or reduced bolt drop from creating the item. Minecraft has a medieval fantasy setting, and enhancing the crossbow any further would <em>in my opinion</em> be crossing a line from what the game currently provides players with and a first-person shooter with building and survival aspects.</p>\n<p>One thing I disagree with about the original post is the necessity of a&nbsp;<strong>[Lead]</strong> in the recipe, which&nbsp;<em>in my opinion</em> seems like a logical but unnecessarily complicating requirement. There are quite a few recipes currently in the game that don't exactly adhere to logical craftsmanship, so there shouldn't be any reason to start adding complex recipes - a simple <strong>[Crossbow] + [Telescope]</strong> will suffice.</p>",

If it were me I'd say you could make an eponymous enchanted pickaxe mine certain types of stone as though with haste II, effectively giving you instant mining -- the kicker is that it would start at the normal rate of mining, and then it's efficiency would <strong>accelerate</strong> over time as you hold the button down.</p>\n<p>For example, you wanted to make a tunnel through a long stretch of solid rock. When you start, its the normal mining rate, and the more blocks you dig through the mining speed will slowly tick up until you're going through blocks instantly. Depending on the level of enchantment this might take a few stacks of blocks to peak, or in just a few seconds. A pick with a higher efficiency ought to stack with the effect so you'd need at least efficiency III or so before you see instant mining results.</p>\n<p>You could call it <strong>Logging</strong> for axes and maybe <strong>Earth Aspect</strong> for picks; something with \"aspect\" or \"affinity.\"</p>",

Once you're in late game you can start mining even more quickly, without it being <em>too</em> OP, and the responsibility of watching the durability is on you same as Haste excavating and you still control what gets broken.</p>\n<p>This would be the best way to allow for Efficiency-ing wood/logs (since its rare it wouldn't allow players to gather wood too quickly early on), and could even be a good way to break Deepslate faster (🙏). Traditionally hard to break blocks like Obsidian could have their mining time shortened.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This would be a great loot item in the Deep Dark. Dealing with the Warden and having to mine normally to get there, it would be a highly desirable reward for exploring, and give players that final touch on their tool to make their mega projects a little easier. It also allows for using Silk Touch too. With twice as many blocks to dig now, this enchant would really be a huge quality of life upgrade that is sorely needed. As most enchants only go to 5, having a super rare enchant that goes one higher would seem appropriate, and you could make an advancement called \"These Go To Eleven\" too 😋</p>",

The tracks already exists the item that can become a coupler already exists in the form of chains and can be easily added and removed by simply allowing them to be applied between minecarts as well as removed by right clicking allowing custom consists of all varieties in both types and lengths.  Minecarts could be used for livestock, villager, and passenger rail.  Minecarts with chests would serve for all block transportation including buckets for lava and water allowing for much easier facilitation of outposts capable of cobblestations production and many simple farms.  While minecarts with hoppers and tnt would be able to serve for distant mining and quarry operations.  Powered carts could be created by simply adding Redstone and copper using the furnace cart as the center of the recipe grid.  Allowing for coal to be used just as it was with furnace carts which would allow the old system to power them to simply be recycled.  Allow the carts to power in either direction or allow them to be picked up like any other block and placed on either snd of a freight consist.  The only other big thing for me is allow perpendicular crossover on rails which even for regular minecarts would help.  This will ensure a much easier exploration of our world's over long distances and the ability to build larger and more complex creations thanks to a much more efficient means of transporting building/raw materials</p>",
