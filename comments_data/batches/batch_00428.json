The plasma could not be carried with bare hands, otherwise you'd get the wither effect. It must only be transported in a minecart. To craft with it, you put it in an oven as fuel and then add your iron tool of choice. The charge is transferred into the iron and you get an energy tool. This can also be done with shields but should not be done with iron armor. That would be a fatal mistake. It would lose durability while you, the player with the armor on, get killed by wither effect level 2.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now, energy tools would be faster than their iron counterparts and have the same strength (except the pickaxe that can mine diamond level), but it would have less durability. The durability can be recharged in a furnace as long as the item isn't fully used up.&nbsp;</p>",

I'm thinking it should require a number of ender pearls based on the distance. Something like p = sqrt(d/256), where p is the number of ender pearls, and d is the distance between the two portals. So the pattern would look something like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 pearl (p) gets up to 256 blocks (d)</li>\n<li>2, up to 1024</li>\n<li>3, up to 9216</li>\n<li>...</li>\n<li>16 (max) up to 65,536 blocks</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm envisioning a UI kind of like a hopper or dispenser, where the player could store pearls for future use. The player could also feed pearls into the teleporter with a hopper. To avoid abuse this form of transport would have to be prohibited in the Nether, and telepads in the End could not connect to telepads in the Overworld.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, this absolutely needs to be limited to end game players who have been to the end. I think an appropriate recipe would require purpur. The crafting recipe would look something like this:</p>\n<p>O O O</p>\n<p>P D P</p>\n<p>P N P</p>\n<p>(O = blank, N = nether star, P = purpur block, D = diamond)</p>\n<p>If developers feel this recipe should be more costly, they could require a diamond block instead of a single diamond, and shulker shells instead of purpur.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@Martin Nether stars are hard to get, but the ability to teleport is very powerful. Requiring players to choose between a beacon or a teleporter, instead of giving them both for free, means they have to make an interesting gameplay decision based on their particular situation and needs.</p>",

If you could take the eyes of ender out of an end portal, you would be able to find several strongholds, steal the eyes from the unfinished portals there, and then use them to complete at least one portal in another stronghold once you collect enough of them. In fact, once you had a single eye of ender, you could even risk throwing it to help you find one of the other strongholds.<br><br>Currently, the only way to beat the game in peaceful difficulty is to get really lucky and have a seed that generates an end portal with all 12 eyes present.

This recipe is for a Display Case that can only contain items/blocks that are about less than a Block in size. You can adjust its size by putting multiple Display Cases in the Crafting Table. Cases arranged in a 4x4 square will house items/blocks that are less than 2 blocks in size. Arranged in a 1x2 rectangle will house blocks that are less than 1 block wide but less than 2 blocks high, The maximum size is 3x3.<br><br>To place an item in the Display Case, just right click on it similar to an Item Frame. You can break it with a Pick Axe and it drops the item itself, unlike Glass. If there's an Item displayed there, it also drops the item.</p>",
