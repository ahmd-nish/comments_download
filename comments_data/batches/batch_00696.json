        "body": "<p>Unfortunately this seems like a weaker version of fire aspect. So I think it should get a few adjustments to make it unique to itself. Here are a few of my ideas: 1. Instead of a slowness effect as that is a potion effect and doesn't often go with enchantments, I think it might make more sense to adjust how the freezing effect works in itself. So I think when one has freezing it should prevent regeneration or slow it down. This would make it more unique and useful in certain combat scenarios such as when you are fighting a witch, or another player.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The freezing effect should be an effect that wears off overtime. The more of it you have the longer it takes to wear off with the maximum amount you can have is when you are at the point that your hearts are turning blue.</p>\n<p>Enchantment levels each level of the enchantment increases the amount of the freezing effect you get when hit.</p>\n<p>You should not be able to add this to items with flame or fire aspect. I am unsure as to whether this should be a melee or projectile enchantment so I put both. I also think it would be cool if strays could spawn with the enchantment.</p>\n<p>Finally as a possibility in order to make it unique to other mobs in combat is that when hit by a weapon with said enchantment there would be a slight chance of being frozen. Essentially when hit you can end up frozen in place without being able to move for about a second or less. To indicate such perhaps the mob or player would also turn blue. Each level increases the chance.</p>",

However, I could see this enchantment impacting attack speed in a unique way. Mobs and creatures will now attack slower (longer time between attacks), and players in PvP hit with the effect will receive one of the following debuffs (depending on platform or if the next update reunites combat mechanics between Java and Bedrock): In Java, players will have a longer wait time for their weapons to charge for a full attack (and bows will take longer to draw). Bedrock players, instead, will have a longer wait time between attacks (same as mobs). In addition to this, higher tiers of the enchantment will extend the duration. Frost Aspect I could last for 3 seconds and II could last for 6 seconds. These effects don't need to last long on their own because attacking continuously will reset the timer.</p>",

The Frostbite enchantment would increment a target's TicksFrozen tag on a sufficiently charged hit, adding 40 if the target is already freezing and 100 otherwise.</p>\n<p>This would leverage most of the current freezing mechanics to create interesting gameplay: Each hit would only partially freeze targets, but if you land enough successive hits (about 4 in 2.5 seconds, right at a sword's attack rate, or 5 hits in 5 seconds, which gives nearly 2 seconds of leeway), the target starts freezing, slowing them for at least 7.5 seconds (+1 second for every additional hit while freezing), and dealing some additional damage over time (1 damage per 120 TicksFrozen above 300).</p>",

I also thought that Grimstone was quite weird and eerie when I first heard the name. The purpose of the rename, according to Henrik Kniberg, was because the old name basically sounded grim. That might seem as a positive, but for the developers, the mood you get from a certain block or mob shouldn't just be told to you. It's like telling you that you must feel grim when seeing the block. There is something more interesting about a block that feels grim wtihout direct association with the word grim, and the developers think it fits more into the design. At least that is what I got from Henrik Kniberg's tweet.</p>",

Grimstone comes from the word grim. That word alone makes a powerful description of what the deep dark will be. Grim meaning: forbidding, uninviting, harsh, merciless, severe, worrying to consider and in some cases, sinister.

I'm not sure a aggressive mob would be needed since the risk of death would be relatively high in the deep.  My last thoughts on a deeper ocean would be giant clams that have pearls.  The clams should be able to hurt you as a trade off for collecting pearls.  As for a use for the pearls themselves, I can't think of anything but white dye and villager trading, white armor trims could be an option, or a recipe for brewing.</p>",

Spawn proofing an area previously was really tedious and unintuitive; this change makes it so much less painless. Monster spawns during the night and in dark caves don't feel different either, which is nice, they feel about the same as 1.17. The one complaint I have is that cave spider spawners feel a lot easier than before (I didn't find any dungeons, so can't comment on those). You can light them pretty easily from a distance, without really needing to deal with the cobwebs. I even ran into a cave spider spawner in a lush cave that was (mostly) deactivated by glowberries, which is cool rare generation, but I'm not sure if it's balanced.</p>",

It’s nice that we already have the tinted glass block to go along with this to fix a lot of the lighting issues that this could cause in farms. Overall though, if this is reverted, it would be nice to replace it with some way to indicate light levels on Bedrock edition so that Bedrock players have parity on the F3 menu. This update would also enable way better ambient lighting as builders could light up an area with more creative lighting without mobs spawning everywhere. I recently torch spammed a village that I think would look much nicer with alternate lighting sources that would be buffed by this change such as the glow lichen and soul torches.  This also has a nice effect on mushroom farms where we can have spawn-free mushroom farms without worrying about soul torch spamming. I’m not experienced enough in red stone to know, but red stone torches may need a nerf on their light level or something to keep this from breaking farms. This might not be the case though, and someone more experienced in this area should have the authoritative voice here.</p>",

The caves are suppose to be a challenge and some players feel as though this change will make it too easy.</p>\n<p>Not to mention, this might be a huge blow to mob farming, especially ones that involves nether portals.</p>\n<p>The change in mob light level will affect other areas of gameplay. Ex. In dark oak forest, it will be a whole lot more difficult for hostile mobs to spawn in this biome, making the experience of going to the dark oak forest and gather dark oak safer, but a lot less unique.</p>\n<p>Many have also said that this lighting change will help building with mood lighting, but there is an argument to be made that this change in difficulty could reduce creative uses of blocks. If light levels were changed, then players wanting to use reduced light levels for builds wouldn’t have as much of an incentive to try spawn proofing in other ways like using carpet, slabs, and glass. It’s the same reason why vertical slabs will never be added. The difficulty and limitations in building encourages out of the box thinking for building and one crucial difficulty that helps with creativity is the light level.</p>",

There's no reason to think that the only way to make the mobs harder is to eliminate this feature.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, it would be nice if there were a more natural way to tell in which places slimes spawn, since we're talking about mob spawns. Maybe now with the new underground biomes we can have slimes spawning in specific biomes that the player can recognize visually? Right now we basically have to use third party tools to analyze the seed or dig a huge pit and watch with chunk borders enabled to figure out where slimes will spawn, which obviously is bad for immersion.</p>",

Moody lightning and usefulness of other light sources that weren't for example torches or glowstone, was something that was missing and an issue in this game.

However this may decrease the overall numbers of mobs players encounter, especially because of glow lichen spawning and the increased number of caves where mobs can spawn inaccessible to the player.</p>\n<p>To counteract this, perhaps increase the number of monsters spawning overall, decrease the distance mobs can spawn from the player or alternatively apply the zombie reinforcement mechanics to other mobs such as spiders and skeletons, meaning the player might have to deal with more of them, thus creating more dynamic mob encounters. This variable could be tweaked depending on the world difficulty as well as local difficulty and has precedent in zombie mechanics already in-game. I don't believe this would make the game too difficult as the player is unlikely to get cornered in the newer, more open caves where hoard reinforcement mechanics would come into play most often, and the reinforcements could be disabled completely on easy difficulties.</p>\n<p>This could also lead to innovations in more types of mob farm utilising reinforcement mechanics, and many technical players would likely appreciate a lowered mob spawning radius so certain types of farm would require less spawnproofing, such as in the nether where light levels wouldn't apply.</p>",

It's amazing for building, with moody lighting and still be mob proof, so thats a big plus!</p>\n<p>An idea is that maybe have different spawning-light-criteria in different biomes perhaps. So like in the mooshroom islands they can't spawn at all, maybe it would be different criteria when on different height. The lower you go the higher light they can spawn in. So mountains would be safer from mobs than on flat ground, but overworld would still beat the caves.</p>\n<p>It could work with&nbsp;<em>height&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>biomes</em> or something else. Maybe more biomes could have exclusive mobspawns. Like the deep dark whould only spawn the warden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thats my thoughts on new spawning rules in 1.18+</p>",

I prefer a challenge and I believe it is in the best interest of games such as this to have moments where the players must choose to take risks such as mining large caves with the possibility of encountering more danger. If I choose to explore that big cavern I found, I should expect to fight for my chance at easily found riches and ore. But maybe my friend next door disagrees. He may enjoy playing with mobs, but perhaps he prefers less of a challenge and enjoys a more risk-free adventurous approach. The answer is simple: allow us, the players, to decide our own individual preferences for a challenge. Maybe allow us to choose how many mobs may spawn, how far away they may spawn, how often, and even under what light level conditions. It's a win-win for everyone and considering how this game's biggest promise is to allow players to make their own adventures, it'd be logical to also allow players to set the bar for how they wish their adventures to play out.&nbsp;</p>",

Monster spawning in Bedrock is quite different from in Java, of course, so please wait until we Bedrock players have had a chance to contribute to the discussion before you make any decisions to change it.</p>",

I just personally was enjoying the idea of monsters only coming out of caves and forests at night and not spawning in the open. Makes them seem spookier (though admittedly harder to hunt).</p>\n<p>Edits:<br>I see some talk about making the spawning light level tied to difficulty, but I don't like that idea at all. The places where mobs spawn is more of an atmospheric/worldbuilding consideration in my opinion. I don't think it is an aspect of difficulty considering you can run right through them and their health and damage really only matters if you stop for combat.<br><br>Keeping the natural spawner behaviour the same as before is probably smart though to keep cave spiders and dungeons from being changed.</p>",

Mobs spawning only in total darkness makes so much more sense and is more intuitive. Not having to torch spam is a really great quality of life feature too. The uniform spawning speed is good but does bring up some concerns. A way to fix this might be to increase the mob cap at lower Y levels. This could fix some of the qualms of the technical community as well as be really neat for exploring as you would encounter more mobs at greater depth to make it more dangerous also evening out the more plentiful resources found below y=0. This could be a great gameplay mechanic and many games have something similar already. To go along with this I don't think mobs should spawn on the surface at night. Or at least they should spawn far less often. They should still be able to spawn under blocks just not out in the open. I think this would be a great way to balance out the early game or new player feeling of being killed over and over again and would decrease the necessity of sleeping to avoid the frustration. This could even be tied to the moon cycle for an even more interesting approach. To find monsters for their drops all you have to do is go down where there are monsters to guard the resources in the deeper depths.&nbsp;</p>",

That's fine, but I'd like them to be more like the drowned. <br><br>They in water but there is a chance that any zombie that enters the water is going to become one. I'd like to see that sort of chance applied to any zombie who wanders into the desert. Let the heat bake them until they become a husk! <br><br>You could do the same thing with skeletons freezing into strays if they spawn in the colder biomes or fall into powdered snow. Those mobs can be extremely uncommon and it would be nice to see more of them. <br><br>Zombies could also now go after pigs, infecting them and turning them into zombified hoglin the same way they go after villagers and try to transform them. <br><br>Again these are mechanics that are already in the game it should be really easy to add them. But since they would also all result in a slightly harder game please also make settings to turn this behavior on and off.</p>",

I don't like the idea of different difficult changing the number. First that would be confusing for switching servers and worlds making more rules to remember. Second that would mean harder difficulty's just need more torch spam, and that's not skill.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An idea that could lead to some amazing technical farms would be different mobs have different light levels (I know this already applies to some mobs). But for example enderman could only spawn in total darkness. Baby zombies need a bit more darkness then normal ones ect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Finally I like the part were sunlight and block light should be different levels. I like sunlight staying at level 7 (or even higher) because if sunlight was evaluated at the same level as block light natural cave openings and overhangs would not have as many mobs. This would also keep it so existing mob farms with shade above would not have to have to be expanded and new farms would not have to be larger.</p>",

I would love to implement candles into my survival builds because they are such a fun aesthetic, but due to mobs spawning in the lower 8 of the 16 light levels, I just can't. It's not worth accidentally inviting a Creeper into my house just to have moody lighting. I think the candles create a great lighting contrast inside buildings; I love the \"aura\" they give off! This simply just isn't possible with torches in my opinion because their light speeds too far, but in the current state of the game, torches are one of few options for lighting lest you accidentally leave one corner of your house at light level 7 and come home to an unpleasant surprise.</p>\n<p>On another note, I like playing in hard. But with the beautiful new large caves, there is just an overwhelming amount of mobs all the time. This new feature would be great to create a safe path through these massive openings without attracting Skeletons with enchanted bows or hoards of armored Zombies!</p>\n<p>Personally, I feel like illuminating villages is more work than it's worth, so I often find myself turning villager homes into prisons because they won't be safe at night otherwise. Having torches block off an entire 15 block radius will make sure you don't miss a spot in your spawn proofing.</p>\n<p>Lastly, this feature will make it easier to determine whether mobs can spawn in certain areas on Bedrock because it doesn't have the F3 menu that shows you the light level.</p>",

I think the goat should drop its horn if it hits any block and not just logs but I don’t know if that’s a bug. I think a really cool idea would be to distract the Warden because the goat horn produces a lot of sound. It would be really funny if the player was given slowness to show that they are out of breath making all of that sound to not make it to op. Another arguably better use is when using the goat horn it would help you find the deep dark or ancient cities because currently they are super rare. Maybe all of the skulks activating at once could send a beam of light or audio clue to guide the player to exploration.</p>",
