Here are my more specific thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Skin tone: I didn't really notice how making all villagers white was racist until somebody else pointed it out to me a few years ago, but ever since, varied skin tones has been something I've wanted to see in villagers! I was so glad to see that the villagers in Legends have two skin tones, and I would love to see that in Minecraft as well!</li>\n<li>Hair: I know Mojang might be kind of afraid of making villagers look weird by adding hair, but as someone who's played a few mods that add types of villagers with hair, I know it doesn't actually look that weird. Besides, it would take away from the masculine feel of the villager, as they're supposed to be non-binary.</li>\n<li>Noses: Make them smaller. It just looks weird. I know that this would probably require a complete overhaul of the villager appearance, so Mojang is afraid to do it, but it's anti-semitic, and Minecraft is supposed to be inclusive to everyone.</li>\n</ul>",

In the treasure category could be other enchantments like \"<strong>Riptide</strong>\" that would need to be found on Ocean Monuments or \"<strong>Frost Walker</strong>\" found only on Igloos.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next comment...</p>",
