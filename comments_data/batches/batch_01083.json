I would rather have a game mechanic in place to speed up growth rate or make the farm more durable or less likely to get stepped on. Sower might be fun. With my knowledge of the game mechanics, I don't know if wet soil actually improves farming beyond the chance of that block to revert back to soil. Tiller would be usable, or just add an unbreaking enchantment instead or along with.</p>\n\n<p>Mending would be an option, but I don't think adds much. Some harvesting enchantment would be cool, but I think there is a more unknown tip of using fortune enchanted tools to increase the drop rates of some crops.</p>",

Two, If you are just delicate with your crops or create pathways through it and work with ranged weapons this can be completely obsolete, This would work better if they made a different type of dirt that is more resistant after sowing and harder to break than normal and coarse.</p>\n\n<p>Sower - This would be a very unwieldy enchantment if you are organanized with farming (Which hopefully most people are.) This also would be way too overpowered as it would allow you to gain crops you shouldnt be able to alot earlier than normal. Plus it just doesn't make sense that tilling the ground woukd suddenly summon plants If this was implemented, It couldn't work with Tiller if it somehow got in.</p>\n\n<p>Moisture - This enchantment, I honestly like! Not overly overpowered and would probably be fairly rare being one of the single-level enchantments, Though if Growth somehow ended up getting in, It wouldnt work with this having similar effects though.</p>\n\n<p>Tiller - Like Sower, This would be really unwieldy and difficult to use if you farm organized, If it did get in, It would probably burn up extra durability and only be a perk of speeding up the Tilling process and nothing more.</p>",

I want to expand on this: Starting out very similar to the original post, the more you swing at a mob / player and actually land a hit, the more you will increase your Combo (Even if you're spam-clicking). HOWEVER, the second you swing and MISS, your Combo is reset, completley taking away that advantage you just got. Being hit also very slightly reduces your Combo, but won't overpower the gains of dealing hits (At least not in PvP).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This not only gives you the freedom to click as fast as you want, but it also takes skill to be good at. If you just spam-click without good aim, someone can just strafe to dodge you (Or, plain bad aim will do that job for them), and deal way more damage than you. How fast you can hit really depends on your ability to react to your opponent's moves, and that's something that beforehand, either really didn't matter (Pre-1.9), or was severely outweighed by something else (1.9 and beyond).</p>",

The fact Minecraft has unrealistic physics, mythical mobs, unrealistic health bars, hunger bars, etc. is the reason why it's so fun. If you make it realistic, you take away Minecraft's plot line and the reason why it's an entertaining and enjoyable game. If you take commands away, it takes so many fun things to do in Minecraft that are also useful. However, if you want realistic Minecraft, just download a bunch of mods and try playing it like that. Plus, the reason why Mojang didn't add fireflies is because it would lag your game a lot. Also, we really don't need or want religions added to Minecraft, it's a really bad idea.&nbsp;</p>",

A larger max range would make the intermediate ranges also useful. On top of that, builds in Minecraft tend to be much bigger than a beacon's effect range. Having a much larger beacon range would make it so that it's not necessary to spam beacons if you need more coverage. I'd love to see a max range beacon reach maybe a 100 chunks but I can see how there would be tech limitations given the player's render distance.</p>",
