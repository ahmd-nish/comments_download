I think this would be fantastic to add to the game. However, there is one issue. This would be amazing in the game but it would take a long time to make happen. Besides that, I think that this new dimension rather than just new structure could completely change how long term players view the game, don’t ya think?

The \"slime witch\" can already be done with spawners.</p>\n<p>Larger slimes however could be a nice idea, adding a greater challenge as normal slimes are weak.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is perhaps a bouncier slime variant? Something unique to give the slime cave extra flare. It and its drops could perhaps behave like a bouncy ball. Perhaps even something like the orange gel from Portal 2?</p>\n<p>Huts or structures covered in slime could also make it interesting as well as add a hint of lore.</p>\n<p>The main issue I see is that getting slime blocks would be too easy and make slimes largely useless with that supply of slime blocks. It'd probably have to be comprised of a new block that won't do that.</p>",
