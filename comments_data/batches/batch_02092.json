That would be good b/c then the feature would still be useful even after getting lots of emeralds.</p>\n<p>Sadly, I don't think this would stop players from killing the WT (and meme-ifying killing the WT) bc doing so still offers a reward: Leads and Llamas/leather.</p>\n<p>I think to fully prevent this there should be a consequence to killing the WT, like reducing that player's global popularity with all Villagers (would require a new stat/mechanic since current Popularity is stored per Village). If the player wants to kill the WT, then they must receive higher trade prices with all Villagers, and, if the popularity gets low enough, then Iron Golems become hostile. I think then players would actually stop killing the WT for leads.</p>",

There are already a few posts on illager types that would do that so you can look at those\n<br /> But basically we might just get a pillager that will set things on fire such as an arsonist, or one that will blow things up.
