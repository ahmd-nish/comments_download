But I did have a looksee on nVidia's website before I bought it &amp; it DID list Minecraft as one of the games that can be played on it. I've purchased both the Android &amp; Windows 10 versions of Minecraft in the past. Well when I got the Shield box home &amp; fired it up, Minecraft did NOT show up in the Shield's version of Google Play. I went online &amp; did a little research &amp; found out that it is no longer supported for the Shield......I was very angry.<br>Now I have sideloaded it with the latest version (v1.13.0) that I had to get the apk from my rooted tablet onto the Shield via USB Flash Drive. It installed &amp; plays fine.....except I am getting alot of force closes when I'm in the menus. I don't know why Minecraft is no longer supported for the Shield TV but it doesn't look like it's anything major they would have to change within Minecraft's code in order for this to work proficiently &amp; also to be supported for Google Play. I don't see the nVidia Shield TV box fading away anytime soon....especially now that they just released a brand new model less than a week ago &amp; the Shield is now being hailed as the best Android TV box currently on the market, thanks to the beefy Tegra X1 SoC processor.<br>So......I ask all of those at Mojang, please get this corrected asap.Please ADD BACK support for the nVidia SHIELD Android TV Box.<br><br>Thanks,</p>\n<p>James L.</p>",

In the description it says Buying the game will give plastic texture pack, 700 minecoins and a skin pack. I don't need these things, for texture pack I could just make it or download it. I don't play on marketplace . If the price for Win10 edition becomes 600 or under 800 rupees I will be happy!. Btw I love Minecraft but just need a price drop :D</p>",

But adding new features and functionalities through mods, datapacks, texture packs in bedrock is horrible, besides the features that have java for the same PC platform.

The big problem with it however, is the fact that all modders will have to learn C++ (which is harder to learn than Java) to keep modding and about half of current mods will be discontinued because people don't wanna deal with learning another programming language. I think C++ is also the reason the Java modding community can't support Bedrock. Most people can't be bothered with the hassle and prefer to stick to what they already know. This change would take a big leap on the Minecraft community but I think it would be for the better in the long term.</p>",

Well written Java can match C++ in terms of performance, sometimes even surpassing the latter thanks to modern Java Virtual Machines like HotSpot (Which is the one Minecraft runs on). The issue is that the way Notch initially wrote the game was rather poor, as evidenced by third party servers (Still written in Java, mind you) achieving much higher performance than the base game thanks to their better written code. Java being less stable than C++? Don't be ridiculous. In C++ one has to worry about platform specific issues like longs being different sizes on different devices (A significant issue within the HotSpot code base), and you have to hand optimize low level aspects of your C++ to get it to perform well and worry about things like alignment and especially memory management, which would take up significant time to maintain, while in Java you can immediately jump to writing game mechanics. Rewriting an entire game in a new programming language and incurring all that platform specificity as a result AND have to deal with build issues for each different compiler one at a time is a terrible idea, all in all</p>",
