Honestly is a great idea but in my opinion it gives a bit more customization if we could craft it out of more things but then again maybe something like iron or copper is enough the general idea is that it could work perfectly to maybe give horse riding a bit more of a point as after reaching the elytra horses are usually thrown in the dust but great idea!</p>",
