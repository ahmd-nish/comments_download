        "body": "<p>These ideas are not very good in my opinion, not only because Minecraft is not a role-playing game, but also because you seem not to have really thought about how these changes might affect the rest of the game. For example, being able to play as a small character probably would mean you could fit through one-block high ceilings and have a smaller hitbox, which could give you an unfair advantage over other players in multiplayer or PVP settings. And tell me, how exactly would adding crawling or laying down enrich or add to the game? If your only answer is \"storytelling\", then you need to reconsider the soundness of your ideas.</p>\n<p>That said, I would definitely encourage you to look into modded Minecraft (if you don't know, that basically means add-ons that someone else created for the game). Someone more knowledgeable than me might be able to point you to specifics, but I am sure that you could find mods that add some of the features you describe.

She plays mostly role playing by herself on the iPad, I would like to gets mods for her but I have no idea how to do that or even if you can on the iPad, I'm not the best with technology, if any one knows of a dummie tutorial I can follow on the iPad please let me know.

With that in mind, I have two recommendations for you.</p>\n<p>1) If your daughter doesn't have a good skin (<a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Skin)%C2%A0already\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Skin</a>) already, consider getting her one. There are plenty of skins available that would make your daughter's character look like a young girl, or a cat, or an astronaut, or really whatever she wants to look like. This might help your daughter feel more \"in character\" when she plays Minecraft.</p>\n<p>2) If she is using an iPad, you need to look into&nbsp;<em>add-ons</em>, not mods. Mods are for the computer edition. Read this official article about add-ons (<a href=\"https://minecraft.net/en-us/addons/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://minecraft.net/en-us/addons/</a>) to get started. It will take some research to get it to work, and I can't guarantee you'll find exactly what she wants, but you might find something she does like. Hope it works out!</p>",

MacchuPicchu, I see where you're coming from, but like in xD4DDYx's case, their daughter likes being able to role play in her own worlds. I, personally can see how servers like Hypixel can make certain rules for sizes in PvP stances. I myself heir on the side of role play as a smaller player would make better diversity for said players, and could draw in more players to join in the MC community. Also, it could explain how the baby zombies, husks, and drowneds came to existence as the base sizes are basically recolored (retexured in drowned's case) versions of Steve.</p>",

I know a lot of little kids and typically they are shy around people who are literally twice their size, but if you were a little kid in Minecraft they would come up to you and trade with you for all sorts of strange items, from the novice level of their trade or just random objects in general. </p>\n\n<p>In superflat worlds there is no way to get to the end unless you turn on those crazy floating strongholds, but now if you can play with the little villagers they might give you something for beating them. Most young kids have a strange and sometimes aggravating habit of picking up the most random objects from gravel to bottle caps to your neighbor’s car keys (LOL). So we can use this trait in the game, if you beat them you have a small percentage of getting a “strange rock” which if enough are collected (144) you could craft the necessary pieces to an END portal. But I wouldn’t enjoy this unless the probability of getting a strange rock or anything useful was below 2-3%. The games could also get harder (in that village only) as you play more because the overall skill is always getting better.</p>\n\n<p>Another fun thing that might be fun is the ability to hide in chests, either just for the pure fun of it or for the ability to hide from monsters.</p>",

During the cooldown you can't use a rocket.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As people said, late game when you have multiple farms for sugar cane and gunpower, then it's not hard to make rockets - but the same could be said for arrows and the infinity enchantment. If you stop players from putting mending and this enchantment both on the same elytra, then it creates a nice trade-off (which Mojang seem to like doing). You'll likely still get some people who don't mind using rockets, since it makes it easier for elytra to be fixed.</p>",

I personally want achievements to be allowed with behavior packs, only because people have used&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong><em>MCC Tool Chest PE&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong> to bypass being in creative and re-enabling achievements. Also, like the other person said, using the tool I mentioned above it's possible to make a custom map and have achievements re-enabled. So... it doesn't stop them anyways... I would still play the game fair, but the only difference is that I'd be able to have my own mods that I programmed myself from scratch added into my world(s) without achievements being disabled. Such things I make are new mobs, and maybe new biomes, dimensions, and items etc. So... it would be a dream if you could get rid the feature where it enforces us to have achievements disabled in order to have behavior packs enabled. Or at least add an option to choose from like, &gt;add behavior pack with achievements disabled&lt;&nbsp; and&nbsp; &nbsp;&gt;add behavior pack with achievements enabled&lt;&nbsp; With messages explaining what they do individually. It would be similar to the operator without cheats and operator with cheats enabled concept. Same idea.&nbsp; Think about this for awhile... Thanks for taking your time to read this, and have a good day/night.&nbsp;</p>",

It just adds additional wolves to biomes and makes them act differently based on their type. Again, no reason this should affect achievements. I can understand some behavior packs that may change certain core gameplay, but not all of them are linked to an achievement.</p>",

It doesnt even say it on the site which is like an absolute scam. They should just have people buy java so they then get free bedrock. So that way everything is fair with achievements and more since more people have switched to java due to how popular it is among minecraft youtubers. Its just better to only list java and mention that you get free bedrock since they want stuff to be fair for both ends. With achievements though, giving bedrock a lower hand due to being the confirmed hardcore type of edition is just extremely unfair and unjust in everyway possible.</p>",

Maps that are Realms Plus, and maps are achievement disabled. Like at least let SOME of the maps that won't break the system be achievement accessible. Otherwise whats the point on playing these awesome creator maps. The only \"pre made\" maps that you can buy from the market that aren't achievement disabled are the Minecraft Mash Up packs, and those  aren't very diverse or largely built maps. \n<br />Relatively speaking consoles are a poor man's PC, and making the versions so different takes the fun out of it from console players.  I'm sure there is a way to allow achievements for legit players without \"breaking\" the system.</p>",

Other than that there is nothing in creative that I need. I would like to be able to get it all set up, and then switch it to survival with achievements since all play will be authentic survival for any player that joins. We presently can’t do this. This limits how many players can set up a nice spawn for their players and protect it. And sadly for all the great creator worlds on marketplace I don’t play them because they disable achievements. For those labeled “survival spawn” they should be enabled! Just because the creator built some cool buildings for spawn to make it a bit more fun it shouldn’t disable achievements. (Unless they hide loot chests everywhere, but then they shouldn’t be categorized as a survival spawn!)</p>\n<p>This whole thing is a mess and has robbed Bedrock players of the full game of Minecraft.</p>",

Crafting recipe is simple: have 2 normal boats of the same wood (one in the center slot and one to the left of it), 3 planks of the same wood on the bottom row, and 2 wool at the top-right and center right-hand slots. The ship will be 25% slower a normal boat, but it's balanced out with the extra storage and passenger space. Model doesn't change much: remove the oars, make it bigger, and add a mast with a square(or triangle) sail. Inventory UI would be similar to a donkey/mule's UI when opening up it's inventory. Controls stay the same. Adding chests would have the model of the chests at the rear. Adding a banner would add the design to the sail, or maybe just stick the banner at the top of the mast.</p>\n<p>Now, you could do a LOT with this addition: have pillagers spawn in these ships and sail in on you or an unsuspecting village, spawn the wandering trader in one of these and can trade with you out at sea, generate villages out at sea that can have these ships sitting in a dock of some sort. The list goes on and on.</p>",

Its quite stressfull to constantly be keeping them away from even small amount of falldamage and stuff that might acumuulate without you notesing for the entire time you have your world running [possibly several months or years for a regular survival world, as opposed to just starting a new world every time you want to have a pvp match], so they just end up being kept indore or in pens. Yes, it could be an insentive to engage in more of the mechanics of the game [potions] for it to be more exiting, but for people who just want to build pretty houses and stuff its just annoying, and for people who want to do fansy stuff and play lots of the endgame suff there already is one, to heal yourselfe... some people want more cosy than exiting...<br><br>Would make gathering animals from far away more feasable and not so grindy and lategame, even then, using potions is mostly an extreme emergensy usecase for more casual players, not something you carry around stacks of in shulker boxes to casualy make certain your pet has full health...</p>",

        "body": "<p>However late I may be to this post, I have done loads of testing and found crossbows super useful, not perfect, but very useful.</p>\n<p>Why? Well for starters Both piercing and Multishot allow you to hit multiple mobs without using up an arrow, though if you want easy recovery the crossbow becomes a better closer range weapon. The hit-box on piercing arrows is super lenient, so you don’t need the mobs to be perfectly in a row, in-fact piercing is so good that Multishot is actually nearly useless in comparison. As well, with how the crossbow functions, with a little learning and the quick charge enchantment, it’s actually a vast amount faster than fully charging a bow, even if the single target damage is lower.</p>\n<p>Why the speed is key: Quick charge brings the loading time to less than that of the bow, however they difference is that you don’t fire upon release. you actually can load by holding to fire, and once the shot is fired you immediately start reloading, bringing down the reaction time you get from firing consecutive shots with a bow. As well, with a loaded crossbow you always get the fire shot, so by the time a player can aim and fully charge a bow you can have 2 shots fired already, and start loading the third.</p>",

Going into bossfights you can actually just fill up your hotbar with them, and unleash a quick volley for massive dps. This makes certain fights far easier. For just regular mob killing the bow is far better. Mainly because you can one tap just about any basic mob with a single arrow and power V. Unfortunately the amount of situations where you need to kill multiple mobs is quite limited.<br><br>I think multishot could be improved. Multiple stages allowing for more arrows. (less damage per individual arrow as a tradeof, and more reload time to make it hard to refresh) And for there to be a shotgun factor where you deal more damage if all shots hit the same target. It certainly allows you to specialise in close quarters combat without damaging sword or others. (At least not any more than how a bow often outshines a enchanted diamond sword up close with enough power...)</p>",

        "body": "<p>I agree about these points. I made my own Mod for crossbows before crossbows existed in game. I made 4 different ones each varying in strength and reload.</p>\n<p>The wooden one is a quick reload and 2 hits most mobs. But the later x bows one shot mobs but have longer reloads. During loading you are afflicted by slowness III with exception of wooden one since you need to take multiple shots (wooden bow is only slowness II but its only for 3.5 sec). So you can't just run and gun with the late game bows. The highest damage bow requires you reload it for 8 seconds. Also arrow drop is there but its not that much on that late one until you are trying to shoot beyond render distance. Wooden one has its uses but it will burn arrows faster and has the worst arrow speed. I plan to make the iron bow hold two shots but takes a really long time to reload it.</p>\n<p>I haven't tried the newest version of Minecraft's actual crossbows because my mod is incompatible and from this the new ones sound lame. I just can't make fancy stuff like arrow piercing or spread shots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Arguably I may have broken the game allowing for bows to one shot mobs so maybe the late game bows are too good and should reload longer. But I haven't uploaded it to the public so i'm only 'hurting' my own game play.</p>",

Thought I could add a few more thoughts.</p>\n<p>For nerfing quick-charge, well, a minor nerf would be alright, but I wouldn't dramatically nerf it either.</p>\n<p>Considering the crossbow is made using two pieces of iron (one for tripwire hook, one in the recipe) and only one less string than a regular bow, I would expect the crossbow to always be able to keep up with regular bows.</p>\n<p>Concerning the scenario Hilmy091 typed, there's a bit of a decent point there, but at the same time you still need 9 power-enchanted crossbows for that scenario. Mojang can also make power and quick-charge mutually exclusive as well. That, and I'm pretty sure shields are still a thing. Considering the combat tests seem to point towards removing or at least shortening that annoying shield delay, putting up a shield when your opponent fires from far away seems like a pretty simple counter, and if they are close, well, that's when the melee weapons should come slashing away. If they stop firing, chances are they need to reload, and that takes time for nine different weapons.</p>\n<p>Also, who plays with 9 crossbows on all 9 active inventory slots? I would at least have a sword as an emergency weapon and golden apples or whatever food I have as substitute for healing.</p>",

And that's cool, but very niche.

        "body": "<p>I look at the Java Edition of Minecraft and I love the amplified worlds that it has. First, the generation of the biomes is beautiful and engaging. But it makes a great challenge for those who want that kind of terrain, the challenge of going through crazy terrain all over the world. Many dream of this coming to bedrock. I know there are hight limits on bedrock for stability issues, but that's Mainly for the ability of moble devices, the xbox one, and surely the xbox one X could handle that perfectly. Many PC's would be able to handle it too. Even the ps4 can handle that very well, and remember how it worked well for a start on the legacy console edition. It's just the moble devices that struggle, but I don't think it's great to hold it back just because moble devices struggle with it. I know the main focus is the Nether update right now, and future updates, but amplified world option can and will impact previous updates for the better! Just think of the structures, that would be very interesting for how it to play out. If you add the option for at least mainly the consoles and PC's because people who have those higher end devices do not want to miss out. Please consider this feature, and I know that many others would love this feature. Think of all the fun and sparking adventures many players would have. I had made posted this as my own feedback idea, but it was removed maybe because it was too similar to already posted ideas, so I'm reposting this as a comment for supporting someone else's idea. Please Minecraft team, consider this, I very much support this idea, especially legacy Xbox One players loved the amplified terrain option, especially to make creative bases and houses, but that's just a small reason people would like this. This is very important to a lot of the community.</p>",

It is called the Wild Update, so why were there little updates to biomes? Only one new biome was added, and aside from the Deep Dark. Wait wasn't the Deep Dark supposed to be in 1.17 - sorry I meant 1.18. But yeah, when will the other biomes get updated, they are very lacking. The badlands is just terracotta. Don't get me wrong I love terracotta, but what I mean is that its empty. Desert too. For hundreds of blocks I just see 3 things: sand, dead bushes, and cacti. However you can find a pyramid or village if you're lucky. And the Savannah is the same as the desert with the idea that all I see is acacia trees and nothing else with a chance of finding a village. The jungle is very lacking aswell. It doesn't feature anything major, nobody even cares about the jungle temple anymore. Perhaps you could revamp it?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

In fact I personally believe this should be called 'CAVES AND CLIFFS 3' cause deep dark and warden were originally meant to be part of oh caves and cliffs update, but even then we are still missing archaeology and bundles.\n<br />When a person hears 'The Wild Update', they think of  major revamps of biomes such as the Savannah, desert, BIRCH FOREST and other biomes. They think of a plethora of new mobs that are actually related to the wilderness being added, not just a new swamp and cave biome with a couple of new mobs that are somewhat useless (seriously the only you thing you gain from killing warden is bragging rights) and that's it.\n<br />For a name like the Wild, the update is pretty bland and fans would probably be less disappointed if it wasn't given such a name in the first place.</p>",

Parity. \n<br />I know that parity is a work-in-progress and not everything is immediate, but some features are small enough that they truly should’ve been changed years ago. Firstly, the new paintings look amazing, but, unless I’m missing something, they’re not even in bedrock edition- and originally they were a bedrock exclusive! And building features like floating flower pots or commands like locate biome could be really useful to all players and yet it seems they’ve been completely overlooked. \n<br />2. Mangrove Swamps. \n<br />I was so excited to find a mangrove swamp and explore the biome, but upon my arrival it just felt dead. There were only frogs and fish, and the landscape consisted only of mangrove trees. I think a new flower (maybe a mangrove-red color), maybe even muddy pigs, or a new tall-grass variant could make the biome come to life. And after the removal of fireflies, this could be the perfect chance to add a new particle-emitter like the spore blossom. </p>",

It saves you a whole click of a button, but now functionailty is limited. If you make a minecart with TNT, you are now stuck with it forever. If say you needed a bunch of new Minecarts with Furnaces for a project, rather than repurposing some other minecarts temporarily you are now faced with permanently being stuck with a lot of Minecarts w Furnaces that you can't use for anything else! This creates extra demand for iron as you'll now need to make more minecarts (and find somewhere to store them) for various things rather than repurposing existing ones in a pool if that's all you need. I suppose you could use a Minecart w Furnace as a regular stationary furnace, but now you've gotta fork out iron for rails, too. You also can't use a sign on a Minecart with Chest, so labelling will get tricky for those.</p>\n<p>Perhaps a variant such as a \"sticky minecart\" made with slime that would permanently bind the two together and allow them to be both placed and dropped as one item, vs the regular which would dissassemble on breaking.</p>\n<p>Otherwise I've been enjoying the new biome blending and mangrove swamps.

Maybe fireflies can only spawn in the dark in other biomes (if not in the swamp) and you can catch them in a jar (or Minecraft bottle?) but you need to release them so they can live longer and they have a shorter lifespan in the jar. If placing can be added as a feature, \"fireflies in a jar\" can be a new ambient/warm light source to add to builds, or work like lanterns. It would be interesting to see the fireflies flying around in the jar (maybe the more you collect, the more you see, but there is a max limit). Maybe players who are roaming at night can find a sparkle (a group of fireflies) and stay safe there because fewer mobs spawn there (because fireflies are a light source). Also, we need blue dye and yellow dye to combine to make green dye please.</p>",

All particles would return back to nest at daybreak. Having them as individual entities would be too much for the game’s performance. If people still expect to be able to catch them in bottles/jars, left-clicking the nest with a bottle would remove particle effect &amp; give player 1 fly (perhaps the queen?). Placing the fly back to the nest would restore the particles. <br>In these updates, people want something to do or for the game itself to push them to do something, but sometimes players just have to seek out what that is. Think outside the box. I’m happy with how the game is going and I don’t expect any of these changes to happen soon or at all (mods can cover it anyways), just hope the dev team the best.</p>",

I think the stamina bar should have a red zone , where your attacks deal half the damage due to exhaustion located at the far left and 1/3 the size of the entire bar, and a green zone were your attacks are normal. The green bar should be exhausted in 5 axe swings or 10 sword swings and the red one in 2 axe swings or 4 sword swings. The red bar recharges in 4 seconds wile the green one recharges in 20 seconds , you can attack as long as you have stamina , all the stamina bar would have 24 units one unit per second .</p>",

I was on the alpha testing team for Carbon's Airmech (an action RTS). In those days, the game was a much more faithful remake of Herzog Zwei, albeit with an updated twist. It was devilishly fun and addictive. But then they kept tweaking it with all these ideas—different power and health levels, time rules, constant re-balancing, etc. It became so arcane and overly complex that you needed a PhD to figure it out as a newcomer. It still enjoys a following on Steam, but it's not what it used to be.</p>\n<p>We have to remember that the point of playing a game is, ultimately, for fun. Thus far, Minecraft has remained faithful to that rule. Create too many restrictive rules that require a difficult learning curve or just makes things miserable, and you'll alienate new and old players alike.</p>",

I personally dislike having to look down to the hotbar to see the cooldown currently in place, and it would probably be worse if the stamina bar was between xp bar and health/food. A feature I would like to see though is to allow servers to know about the setting of each player or even force one way of displaying it, as server-side plugins surely would like to display information using an added bar. (I know spigot etc. are not supported by mojang but still it'd be nice if the vanilla client supported this.)<br></span></p>",

Ice could last a day, packed ice three days, and blue ice nine days. Biome could affect this too as in a colder biome could make food last longer while a jungle would really speed up food loss. </p>\n\n<p>Another idea for this is to have the food rot into something else, such as, meat into rotting flesh or bone and potato to poison potato for example. Perhaps most of the stuff could be composted at some point.</p>\n\n<p>Most important though would be the ability to turn this on or off when creating your world.

Vines are, in theory, SO aesthetically nice to add a little greenery to a build, you see this constantly in Creative builder videos, and even see them being used this way in Minecraft's promotional artwork, but in practice of actually playing a survival game it's impossible to do this because they will grow like kudzu in every direction. They're practically only useable if you place blocks around them very intentionally to sequester them in a Vine Zone (limited use case), or put string everywhere (not ideal), or use them on a build that is supposed to be completely rundown and overtaken by nature. (Even in my rundown build I had to remove the vines b/c my sheep kept climbing them accidentally, and there's no way to keep them from growing down to the ground!)<br><br>We can clip every other kind of vine and it's so nice!

Each exploit could be remedied depending on how this feature is implemented.</p>\n<p>The first exploit is its ease of use as a fuel source. The obvious solution is to complicate or debuff lava's use as fuel; make it unusable or dangerous. Lava may be too hot for a furnace to contain, the player may lose the bucket containing the iron when its used as fuel, it may destroy items being smelted. The first of these ideas may provide opportunity for a netherite furnace enhancement for endgame players, though this is off-topic.</p>\n<p>The second exploit is its use in destruction, to cover large areas in lava with minimal effort. This may be countered by limiting generation of these lava sources. Already are suggestions of limiting source generation to the Nether, although this may be taken further to prevent griefing of nether builds. My proposed solution to this is to limit lava generation to the Nether's ocean level, allowing players to use the lava lakes as a renewable source of lava, but without allowing creation of lava sources above builds.</p>\n<p>These suggestions are of course complicated, and it's likely better fitting solutions exist. These exploits may even be welcomed by the community, not needing solutions to begin with. Renewable lava, especially in the Nether, is very fitting to the game and I hope it is implemented.</p>",

In many MC servers I've been on, you could take a pump to the nether with magmatic engines/dynamos, back feed the pump with the power sources and ender tank the lava out. Throw down a world anchor or a chunk loader and fill a normal world tank up full of lava, or just have the ender tank run directly through pipes to your machines. It's why now on a lot of servers they setup a infinite lava source for the players via a ender tank they give you the combination to. It was to easy to get power and machines up and going, so they removed the infinite lava in the nether to slow the game and players down. I highly doubt they'll add it back in.</p>",

Maybe animals would only eat low-quality food  such as grass blocks when they are really hungry, while they will always eat wheat. Maybe it would even take wheat to make them breed.</p>",

It is possible to get it back using bonemeal but that makes it quite a bit of an effort, while grass should actually be growing back on its own,(it has no extra value other than seeds and decoration so I suppose it wouldn't give any balancing issues). I think it would be a good way to implement it by giving grass multiple stages, like short grass, normal grass, and double tall grass. overtime, the grass will grow one stage bigger. When breaking the grass it should go down one stage(or cut down entirely with shears). but the first stage cant be removed without using something like a shovel. Only first stage grass will grow back, but not normal grass/dirt blocks. This way you can keep your environment clean if you want to. Now that I think of it... It would be cool if the seeds you get are actually grass seeds so you can replant and grow the grass anywhere you like. Then there would get a grass seed for every stage you break, and an additional chance to get special wheat seeds.</p>",

Before it would need always go branch mining and go for LONG (slow mining) tunnels to be efficient</p>",

Maybe not quite as good as deepslate mining, but still decent (taking the possibility of insta-mining with Haste II and Efficiency V into account). I don't do a lot of mining nowadays, mostly caving, but some people in my family do (most of them are not such experienced players, but they are familiar with older versions of the game), and I also watch streamers do it occasionally, and what I've gathered is that you encounter a lot more interesting obstacles when you mine higher up, such as caves with long drops, aquifers and lava lakes, and overall the process feels <em>more satisfying</em>&nbsp;when you can break blocks faster, even if you get less rewards per time spent.</p>\n<p>The 1.20.1 generation rates in deepslate with no air exposure seem fine, but deepslate mining only feels worthwhile after you get at least Fortune III and Efficiency IV on a diamond pickaxe, and I like that it takes a bit of setting up. But something I'm really not a fan of is how small the diamond veins that you find in <em>caves</em> generally are (in 1.20.1). I think they should rarely yield less than 3 diamonds without the Fortune enchantment. I know things like elytra can make caving a little OP, but my experience with caving in early game (my preferred way to get first diamonds) has often been a bit disappointing because more than half of the time I only get 1-2 diamonds.</p>",

I think the distribution of diamonds and diamond ore across the game needs to be looked at to help make the mining experience satisfying for the player. Additionally, diamonds feel useless after a certain point. I believe the two major issues causing this problem are: A) diamonds and diamond gear being too easily accessible via other methods and B) diamonds not scaling with difficulty.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Firstly I think that one of the primary issues with Minecraft's diamond distribution is that diamonds and diamond gear can be obtained too easily. The player can get diamonds through too many ways, like shipwrecks, villager trades, and the newly added archeology system. But I feel like this accessibility diminishes the significance of actually finding diamond ore through mining. It makes the game less rewarding in the long run because the player has too many easily obtained diamonds. Additionally, handing out diamond tools further diminishes that sense of accomplishment.<br><br>Secondly, diamonds should be used as a reward for facing a challenge. Increasing the diamonds on lower levels is a small step towards fixing this problem, but now they are too common there too. I think the biome should play a role in diamond placement. But in order to keep balance, diamonds and diamond ore should be significantly reduced elsewhere.</p>",

The Caves and Cliffs Update introduced rare iron and copper veins, so it only seems fitting to also have a new diamond structure (not as <em>generous</em> as veins, of course). It'd make mining much more exciting, and maybe we could even make it an advancement. It could consist of 6-8 normal diamond ores surrounding a few of a new kind of <strong>rich diamond ore</strong>, that would yield 3-6 diamonds instead of 1-4, depending on your Fortune level. They could also be biome-bound, as others have suggested.</p>\n<p>Kind of a tangent here, but maybe <em>now</em> is also the moment to consider adding a (costly) <strong>Haste III potion</strong> that grants <strong>insta-mining for deepslate during a <em>short</em> amount of time</strong>, only when using a full Efficiency V Netherite Pickaxe, but I know I'm just being nostalgic of ol' endgame beacon mining (Also, kind reminder that <strong>deepslate itself is a really cool building block</strong>, often needed a lot). Maybe the brewing could <em>require a diamond</em> even, to make it an investment :)</p>\n<p>I don't think just changing the generation rates is enough to make deepslate mining less dull.

Maybe the Deepslate stone shoudn't drop at all if you're not using the right equipment, just like if you try to mine Diamond with a stone pickaxe.</p>",

I have found that redstone is more common in some areas than diamonds. You fixed diamonds being useless except for armor, and then you broke your own fix. The hunt for diamonds is now a trivial thing that takes no skill. Along with what appears to be the complete removal of the \"air exposure reduction\" feature. I was able to find so many diamonds I could get full diamond equipment is 30 minutes. This isn't a good change and my brother and my best friends also agree. In short I'm saying; you fixed the diamond problem by adding armor trims, now you made diamonds much more common, by doing so, you have recreated the previously existing problem. I rate this change 1/10. Its bad for the game. I pray you don't keep it like this</p>",
