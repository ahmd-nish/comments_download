Here is my suggestion:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There would be a dark forest that effects the player with blindness and an abandoned castle hidden within it. This new biome would be called the Sol Kingdom. The chests are full of weapons, bones, and basic items. In the throne room, there is the Sol King. The Sol King is a humanoid creature with blue skin and white eyes like an allay. You could find green glowing cubes known as sols and if you bring enough of them to the king, his eyes will glow green, he will pull out a green glowing sword, and a big boss fight will begin. The Sol King has 200 health points. He will attack the player by summoning armies of skeletons and he can attack the player with his sword. When the Sol King dies, they vanish into a cloud of green particles and drop the Sol Cape. While wearing the soul cape, crouching would cause the player to be effected with Sol. The Sol effect is identical to levitation. However, the cape will need to be powered with sols and it will use sols similar to how a bow uses arrows.</span></p>",

Having the swapper work in any other dimension would break the game completely, but if it only worked in the End, which is supposed to be a desolate place, that would help add more reasons to visit the end and improve the gameplay experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The idea of restricting blocks to specific dimensions is not new, as seen with the respawn anchor and bed. I hope that Mojang can create mobs and resources that can only be farmed to the End, just like they did in the Nether, with Piglin Bartering, Blazes, and Magma Cubes. One idea for a resource is more End-themed building blocks. The End only has three different kinds of blocks available to build with: End Stone (Bricks), Purpur Blocks and Obsidian, so having more options for tones could help players build a more end-themed base without having to resort to using blocks from other dimensions.</p>\n<p>I believe having the Ejector teleport to the same Y-coordinate could improve the skill ceiling in using the Ejector because it adds risk to the player by punishing players who just place it down without any setup, and it can also reward players for setting up the transportation properly by giving them more freedom of movement.</p>",
