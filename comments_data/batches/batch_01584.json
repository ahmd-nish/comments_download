At least one or two additional items as drops, or a completely new item could/should be proposed, such as, shulker eye, shulker meat, etc... Potentially, something to allow the crafting of a levitation potion, and could maybe be called a shulker eye.</p>",

The bonemancer and many more (like my Idea of the nekos, as well as the potential for more Illagers, like the returning Illusioner and dungeon’s enchanter and geomancer), It’d make Minecraft challenging for those who played games like dark souls while still being somewhat fair on newer players by giving them powerful new rewards. As a result, we get this balance of many mobs to fight yet still being able to take all of them all on One by one with a diamond sword with enchanted Iron armor.
