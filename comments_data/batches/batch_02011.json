Also you can include the squeeze function to open up the crafting menu or inventory. For the Double Tap on the Apple Pencil Pro you could use to sort through items in your hotbar. And for all Apple Pencil models other than the USB-C one, use the pressure sensitivity to determine if you are just \"hovering\" over a block and when you press down on the pencil, to place the block you are holding or activate the function of the item you have in your hand. That aforementioned pressure sensitivity would allow you to keep the pencil in contact with the iPad screen. At last you can use tilt sensitivity to determine how fast the camera in all 3 view modes turns. The farther you tilt the pencil the faster the spin and this will allow you to make slow and fine adjustments to your view angle.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I'm in love with the idea of adding descriptions to items in minecraft as a subtle way to inform new players while still letting them figure out things by themselves, and I have a few suggestions to expand on the idea:\n<br />• When hovering above an item as a new player it could be overwhelming to read all the information presented, especially when doing so on enchanted armor, trimmed armor, banners ext. So I suggest that for the Java Edition a key would be assigned to reveal the item description and for Bedrock Edition the description could be revealed in a different tab in the inventory.\n<br />• The descriptions have to be limited to the point of view of the player character meaning no information that isn't known to them such as building a nether portal should be presented. Instead the descriptions should present the items as they appear with additional hints to their potential uses, E.G. Obsidian: \"A tough rock that is formed by rapidly cooling lava. It seems to have some magical properties that could be useful.\" This lets the player look for recipes using the obsidian &amp; discover ruined portals and make their own conclusions.\n<br />• This have the potential to give some lore insights through the items to enchantments, The Nether, mobs ext. E.G Sculk catalyst: \"It seems to use the magical energy of fallen mobs to sustain itself. Makes you wonder what happend in the Deep Dark?\"</p>\n\n<p>It's not meant to be a way to give the player a fixed path, it's a way to give guidance and encourage creativity </p>",
