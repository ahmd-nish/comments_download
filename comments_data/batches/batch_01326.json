By keeping the sculk shrieker \"can_summon\" block state true on natural generation and having farmabe shriekers set to false upon generation by a catalysts this opens the door to both instances where spawnable and decorative variations can both be obtained in survival. This way, the warden can be transported for use in minigames and the dormant variation of the shrieker can be obtained for building. If this change were to be made it might help to have an indicator on the block so players can distinguish the two but personally I think an item ID or NBT tag would suffice.&nbsp;</p>",

The new cave system generation is going to change minecraft forever and in a good way i find. I have heard there is some commotion about the in game depth and height, but all I want to say is that I was really looking for likewise caves from the snapshot and I think that you guys really did a good job already. Whatever choices you guys may take into the future I will stand behind them. I really love the caves and I dont think Diamonds will be to easy to find, because if we need diamonds we only need to mine 1 time with fortune 3 pick and get 2 stacks of diamond. This way it will be a way more fun way to explore the caves and look around for diamonds!! But either way LOVE IT, have a good day and stay safe. -fellow mc player.</p>",

Also, Axolotls are extremely broken when placed in one block high water. They do this messed up bobbing thing and vibrate a little sometimes. And when you summon them from a command block in no water they just float in a direction... Thats all they do. Also I think that there should be a higher chance to have the deep pits of water to be a cave entrance. Don't get me wrong I love minecraft and the new update I just think some cave generation needs fixing</p>\n<p>-BowserSMW</p>",
