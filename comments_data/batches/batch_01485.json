Increase the amount of time you have before you have to sleep again to get rid of the phantoms (but this would only really help in realms).</p>\n<p>2. Reduce spawning of phantoms when in multiplayer servers to stop them from constantly respawning every night so you only have to kill them once per rest. This would be a better option for both servers and realms.</p>\n<p>3. Just get rid of them entirely in realms and servers or at the very least include an option to stop them specifically from spawning in servers and realms.</p>\n<p>That's all I got but if anyone else has any ideas I highly encourage you to put them as a comment.</p>",
