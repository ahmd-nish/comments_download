It is really easy to avoid dangers in the overworld (just sleep), and once you get Diamond armor the Nether becomes quite easy as well. It seems like a fair trade off to me; if you want to get more into the endgame, you need to deal with the challenges it takes. If you want to beat the Ender Dragon on Peaceful, you can always use Seeds that have fully completed End Portals. There are lots of them on Java Edition and only one on Bedrock Edition.</p>",
