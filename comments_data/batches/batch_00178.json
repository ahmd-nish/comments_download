It would definitely make mining more interesting since for the most part, you're just looking for diamonds, iron, or coal; and your biggest threats are surprise creepers, falling from the top of a ravine, and lava. An update expanding on mines and caves would be really cool.</p>",

I think making the depths harder than they are now is kinda crucial to reestablish any kind of difficulty curve, especially with a cave update. I love the idea of less caves, but <strong>bigger</strong> caves.</p>\n<p>For difficulty, I'd imagine something like thick atmosphere that reduces lightsources or field of view. Maybe new mobs that only spawn past a certain level. Maybe even Nether mobs and netherrack by bedrock (I secretly still wish you could mine down to the Nether). I'd like mobs that disregard or even destroy torches, because regular torches make the underground way to cheap to clear out IMO.</p>\n<p>Hard stone sounds great, it really means soft-blocked progression and I love it. If it means the deeper you go, the harder strip mining gets and the more rewarding caving is, I'm 100% on board. Maybe to balance it out, we say that there's gunpowder deposits down below. So, if you can't mine it, blow it up?&nbsp;</p>",

Such a change could create a lot of backlash since it would overhaul parts of Minecraft's difficulty. It also undermines the simplicity of Minecraft, which is highly regarded. But overall it is really a great concept for Minecraft.</p>\n<p>I was thinking of submitting a similar idea since the simple progression even in the beginning of the game, feels a bit too easy. I was thinking of just three layers: Soft Stone, Medium or just Stone, and Hard Stone. The Soft would be mined with at least wooden tools, Medium with stone, and Hard with iron. The higher layers would also not contain any ores of the lower layers, and each layer has a specific set of potential ores: Soft coal; Medium iron, lapis, potentially a new ore like copper, silver or bismuth; Hard gold, redstone, and of course diamonds. It would make mining more organised in a way, however, also boring. Probably the better solution is that each following layer also has the ores of the preceding one, maybe just rarer.&nbsp;</p>",

This would create a really cool atmosphere view when the time swaps, plus it could also be a functional mechanic to tell if its day/night inside the caves as the bats will sleep in the day!</p>\n<p>Then when the bats sleep, they would create a guano layer on the first solid block below, similar to a&nbsp;\"snow\" or \"moss\" layer. This would be a lag and server friendly alternative to it than having items like an \"egg\" spawn and could be used to create interesting guano farms!</p>",

When a Banana is eaten it could leave a Banana Peel which can be turned into fertilizer (or for some other purpose?)</p>\n\n<p>I thought a coconut block could be affected by gravity only when it is not attached to leaves. Harvesting takes a long time unless you use an axe. When you do it always breaks into two halves that can be eaten for small amounts of hunger, or crafted into terrible armour.</p>\n\n<p>Gorillas could spawn here.  The gorillas should come in 3 variants: silverback, normal (female), and baby. The baby will grow into a silverback 15% of the time. To be bred, a silverback and normal gorilla must be given a banana each. Silverbacks are fast and aggressive unless the player holds a banana. Silverbacks are also aggressive to zombies, and skeletons. The normal gorillas are neutral but will fight back when attacked. They drop xp and 0-1 banana peels as loot.  I thought Gorillas were a good idea as they would be a powerful ally or dangerous opponent depending on how we interact.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously I think these are great ideas. This biome could easily be called Archipelago or Jungle Outskirts as well. </p>",
