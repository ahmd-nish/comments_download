        "body": "<p>Wow, I had the exact same idea, that's probably why my post was removed. I first used the world \"vitrine\" instead of \"showcase\", that's why I didn't see your post! I copy it here because it was more specific:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"western\">I would like to see a vitrine block in the game, that is a glass display case. Like the item frame, it would allow to display any item, but potentially bigger. Placed upon a fence or a pillar, it could make a nice display stand.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">To craft it, you would place 1 <a class=\"western\" href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360013657991-Pillow-Seat\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pillow</a> in the bottom middle square and 7 glass panes arranged in the shape of a bell. If pillows are added and have 16 colors, vitrines should also have 16 variants. (By the way somebody thought about coloring item frames <a class=\"western\" href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360013314972-Dyed-Item-Frames\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.)</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Visually, an isolated vitrine block would look like a more or less cubic glass bell covering a small pillow on which rests the object exhibited. I don’t know if it should have the full size of a block (and look like beacons) or not. But it would be possible to connect vitrines side by side to make larger ones like those we see in jewellery stores. It would also connect with adjacent blocks, like glass panes.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">I’m also thinking, even if the devs don’t add pillows, it would still be possible to implement vitrines as simple glass bells. In this case, you would need to have a solid block under it. Or replace the pillow by a carpet or a wool block. So this idea is adaptable, but pillows are really cool because you can sit on them.</p>",

Since a block would have 8 layers, it always drains some sugar in the process.</p>\n<p>The crafting recipe would be a 3x3 sugar square (9 sugar) to offset the possible 8 sugar that might pop up.</p>\n<p>Blocks would drop full blocks, or some sugar(powder) when harvested with missing layers.</p>\n<p>A block like this would allow for slowly dissolving platforms or rain detectors.</p>",

What if it only changed the weather within a radius of the structure (I hate player built structures BTW Just keep it a block IMO ) but if it must go the player built structure rout I suggest building it like a beacon stack and the more layers you build the bigger the radius up to a hard limit.&nbsp; Back to using this on servers this item should be able to be turned off in server.properties.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If I might Expand on this Idea a bit further Could we also make a block that prevents rain / melts snow with in a defined radius too?</p>",
