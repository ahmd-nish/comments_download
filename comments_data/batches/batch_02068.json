Besides, how would the game even recognize a player built base? It's far easier for structures the game itself generated. And the idea that they can steal your stuff? Imagine you died during the raid and all of your backup gear was taken. What then? And as for the camp... that would have to be pre-generated I believe, so you'd have to find the closest one, wherever that may be. Dont get me wrong. I DO like the idea, being more opted towards the combat aspect of Minecraft, but I just dont think it will fit in the base game, or possibly even work well.</p>",
