They can also be sat down <br>-they yell when there are spiders and cave spiders nearby, causing the spiders to run away</p>\n<p>Edit: The eucalyptus plant would be a new tree, and its leaves would drop eucalyptus leaves when using shears, which would act as a block and a way to tame koalas, and the tree would have eucalyptus wood, which would have a slight reddish brown tint(kinda rustic looking)</p>\n<p>Vote my comment up if you like the ideas I stated!</p>",

Once you get some cats or even an ocelot/fox they would basically create a kind of area of effect that repels them from the area, and will catch them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They shouldnt drop anything, like endermites, silverfish or bees. Like fish they can be kept in a tank or enclosure, and their pathfinding should be good enough to race them in mazes. Maybe you could tame them as a kind of ambient pet, which means your other animals wouldnt aggro them, and they would simply run around like a chicken. You could leash them. The Ravager could be spooked by them? Sounds funny.</p>\n<p>Owls are under consideration, and if so you could have them hunt them at night (or just 24/7).</p>\n<p>Theyre basically ambient mobs like bats, but with deeper mechanics. Their annoying presence would essentially simulate food spoilage, and their utility in builds and roleplay would be immense (pet shops, dungeons, sewers, labs, pets, zoos, rat mazes, elaborate mouse traps etc), as well as provide emergent gameplay with their interactions with other mobs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would even settle for them to be completely useless like Bats, or even a particle effect type thing underground or in dungeons, etc</p>",

The non-venomous ones should have bigger claws and should be more common in the forest than in the desert. The desert ones should be a little smaller like what u did with the spiders and cave spiders. There should also be more than 2 different spawn eggs for different variants of scorpions or different colors to represent lethal and non lethal. The venomous scorpions should have 2 attacks: pinching (1 heart of damage) and stinging depending on the variant (wither effect for venomous scorpions, and poison effect for non venomous). Scorpions should be added in the \"cave update\" that many people request (plz make one) because some scorpions live in caves and it would make the most sense like the fish in aquatic update have variants. Plz make the scorpions like that at least 4 different types of scorpions (like the fish) 2 different variants (like the spiders) and 2 different affects u get from them (venomous=wither 2 for 10 seconds) (non-venomous= poison 2 for 5 seconds). I think that scorpions will be a great addition and add a little bit more danger to caves, forests, and deserts. That is why I think that scorpions should be added to Minecraft.</p>",

They will stand defensively upon first seeing the player at a distance, if the player attacks the Scorpion or gets too close to it (maybe 5-7 blocks) then the scorpion will chase and attack. Scorpion attacks mainly with its pincers and has a secondary attack using its stinger which will cause the player to be briefly paralyzed.</p>\n<p>Upon death the Scorpion drops its stinger. The stinger can be used in alchemy to craft a Potion of Paralysis and its variants.</p>\n<p>I feel like this would bring a much needed feeling of danger inside the supposedly \"hostile\" biomes of the minecraft overworld.</p>",

In desert wells, they should appear more often, so that wells also use something! Scorpions could, if you kill them, drop a scorpion sting, which then, combined with a sword, gives players poison! If you had the scorpion stinger just like that in your inventory, it could also poison the player who has it in inventory. Also a chestplate, which combined with the scorpion sting, makes you resistant to attacks with effects. The scorpion sting would then have to be very rare! You could also milk the scorpion, so that you get a bottle of scorpion poison! This could then be used to brew new potions.</p>",

Like Siberian Huskies, commonly known as \"Escape Artist\", they could make that breed in Minecraft which behave like in real life, like you constantly lost your dog.... Or a Greyhound to improve the running speed. And also make the dogs spawn naturally at diffrerent biomes like Husky spawn at Snowy Biomes! I hope the great and big hearted people at Mojang would look this awesome topic ! Cause everything we have now is just a breed of dog called \"Wolf\" (For me, though the wiki say it is wolf, i think they are dogs because those guys behave exact like Dogs when tamed and that represent the origin of dog in real life! )&nbsp;</p>",

Like how Ocelots stayed as is and then created \"cats\" as a new mob, Wolves should stay as is and create a new mob, \"dogs\"! You can breed two tamed dogs to get random breed variants. Examples include: Labrador, golden retriever, doberman, husky, poodle, etc. Additionally; Toy breeds/smaller dogs such as a Pug or Shih Tzu's, could be baby wolf size and Larger breeds like Great Danes or Mastiffs could be horse size! Small, Medium, and Large if you will. If at all possible to do so, I believe all that's been mentioned above should be considered and added with tweaks as needed! Please Upvote and tweet this to the developers to be added in game!</p>",

Instead of having enderman, have phantom like creatures based on manta rays (not sure what these would drop though). Instead of having an island floating, I would do the opposite, where it's at the bottom with the player swimming from above, could have a similar approach with the End dragon with towers that would replenish the health, but this time more of them being lower down instead of high up, as the player would come in from above.</p>\n<p>Similar to End cities there could be Atlantis like cities instead, with standard shulkers there as well, as they would fit in, instead of End ships have submarines, and instead Elytra have flippers, which would have the same sort of effect but under water. I also propose having a gold trident as treasure, slightly more powerful than normal tridents maybe 0.5 - 0.75 higher, but a lot less durable, as gold tends to be.</p>",

So, going along with the idea of what it should look like, maybe it should be call the Sea Slug, if it's looks would be based off of that. There should also be a dragon in the Nether, though. Maybe it could be something similar to the Blue Dragon Sea Slug, but fire/lava related. Any suggestions for this?</p>\n<p>For the new dimension it will be in, I have multiple ideas. The entire area is just water, but there are areas under the water with air pockets(Maybe inside underwater village houses or something). And there should be sharks or something, kind of like how there are Endermen in the End when you fight the Ender Dragon. The portal should have to be created out of coral blocks, or something similar that is water related. The portal would be made with dead coral blocks, but hen you activate it, using water from a water bucket, not only does it open the portal, but it brings the coral blocks back to life that were used to create the portal.</p>",

Going here would require water breathing because you would have to stay down there for a long time. There would be pufferfish that would protect it while it shoots you back with water so that eventually your potions run out and you drown, the water would only deal half a heart of damage. Then, when you defeated the dragon, you would get the Sea Crown, and rare item that allows you to breathe underwater as long as you are wearing it.

You fight, you're winning, it flees. The dragon slams downwards into the seabed, making it's own tunnel as an exit. It makes a vacuum with water flowing into a dark hole. You hesitate on the edge before proceeding forward. The screen loads and it is dark, I mean....<strong>dark.</strong>&nbsp; You spawn in a completely submerged cavern of bedrock. You come to with full air supply, but you have until you drown to defeat the boss. Upon defeat, a surge of water pulls you immediately back to the overworld. You're back at the seabed with full air and with you the loot from the encounter.</div>\n<div class=\"comment-meta\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: #333333; display: inline-block;    font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; cursor: text; display: inline;  font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">Now the other dimension really isn't another 'dimension' but just a controlled realm for the 2nd combat sequence. You have ten seconds from when the dragon hits the seabed and the portal spawns to get sucked in. That leaves time for one last nibble or to think twice about following. For if you die, you lose everything on your person. If you live, the reward is up for question. </span></div>\n<div class=\"comment-meta\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; color: #333333; display: inline-block;    font-size: 15px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; color: #000000; cursor: text; display: inline;  font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">A brewing ingredient for water-breathing until death sounds pretty good, or a unique trident.

I think that the Water Dragon should also not look like the Ender Dragon, it should look more like a large Sea Serpent with Dragon-like features (Dragon Head, Claws, and large fins in place of wings on the back) and should drop a unique item of some kind, allowing the Player to do something interesting involving the Deep Sea. Perhaps a \"Dragon's Eye\" to be added to Tridents, making them stronger. Or maybe something completely different.</p>\n<p>The Water Dragon should have 2 phases in the fight. In the first phase the fight would be rather simple, with the fight consisting of resisting underwater attacks from the Dragon and shooting the Dragon when it comes up out of the water. Once the Dragon loses a quarter of it's health, phase 2 can begin.</p>\n<p>In Phase 2, the Dragon can summon a Storm, allowing for the Dragon to fly and hide in the storm clouds, and the Dragon can summon the new 'Sea Serpent' mob to help attack the Player.</p>",

This kind of thing is appropriate for a 3rd party mod, but not a core feature. Implementing this as a feature creates an official demarcation point of value, that, as time goes on and other people from the Minecraft community pass on, will become increasingly difficult to accommodate or define. The Minecraft community is huge and has a massive number of people worthy of memorial when they pass on... it's just not a good idea to use Minecraft as a memorial, no matter how much we may care deeply about technoblade and his family.</p>",

Everyone wants mobs that have some use, bees give honey, parrots dance, cats ward off creepers, but just having some ambient mobs that fly high overhead that just serve as scenery and audio would be really nice. Although a lot of planning will have to go into making the birds. The bat was added as an ambient mob and people hate it and how much it gets in the way of building. So when people are building in the biome the birds spawn in, it'd be best to find a way to make sure they avoid the player/don't have spawn conditions that let them spawn in whatever structure the player is building. Plus then we could get a hawk pet, as some hawks and eagles and such are endangered, and it could bring the player chicken or small scraps of meat.</p>",

The first spawn egg would just be called birds (I know, very imaginative), like cats they would have different sets of skins. For example, species like blue jays, robins, and cardinals. Each bird would have it’s own designated bird chirp because that makes sense. Did you guys know birds sleep amazing i know. Here’s another bird that I think might go well with these, an owl. Similar to the cat, the owl would have many skins. Let’s get something else it would be similar too, the fox. Like the fox it would be nocturnal and sleep through the day and feast in the night, probably on well, foxes :). They should also changed there coat to white in cold biomes like foxes because that sounds sick. Ducks are another thing that could be added to the game because their adorable and you can’t tell me any different (and I’m not talking about any reskinned chicken). Could be cool to have the duck swim Peacefully on top of the water and fly. Could be cool Mojang. Along with these birds should be nests, a place to lay eggs. my idea is that it can’t be made and only collected. If birds are bred to far from a nest they would look for sticks on the ground and make a nest of there own. Once a nest is nearby they would lay 3-2 eggs and fly off. Maybe if your near when the eggs hatch the birds won’t fly away from you. One problem I can’t figure out is crossbreeding. I’m just a guy with ideas lol.</p>",

Perhaps louder in the morning, quiet at night.</p>\n<p>2. Just like there are tropical fish variants in the ocean, there could be songbird variants on land.</p>\n<p>3. Perhaps one really great use for songbirds is predicting weather. To my knowledge there's no way to track rain and thunderstorms in minecraft. Songbirds could escape into tree leaves and go quiet when a storm is approaching.</p>\n<p>4. Because they live or spawn in trees, as you cut them down, you don't see them anymore. You'll also see them escaping during forest fires.</p>\n<p>But one bird that I personally love and I'd argue has a very Minecraft feel are ravens and/or crows. Crows and ravens are extremely intelligent. They enjoy puzzles, hold grudges, memorize faces, babysit wolf pups and even trade shiny trinkets with people. This means there are a lot of opportunities for what they could bring to Minecraft.</p>\n<p>1. An early game trading and/or item stealing system could work.</p>\n<p>But one thing I haven't seen done is</p>\n<p>2. a mob with the ability to press buttons and pull levers!</p>\n<p>This could offer a world of new ideas for technical Minecraft players, or builders who would like the look of these eerie black birds around their base or perched on their shoulder.</p>",

Change color fit in half slabs, iron bars, and anything with holes. They could promote exploration because if you find one and follow it you can find some neat stuff. Very shy, will eat crabs if added. turn colors, add a bit more to a coral reef. It will steal shiny treasures if it finds a chest underwater. It would have a cool eating animation where it grabs the food and uses all eight technicals to shove it into it’s mouth. For crabs it will camouflage and sneak up on them and pounce spreading it’s arms into a net then eating animation. It would not swim but walk against the sea floor with the crabs giving you a reason to dive deep down. It would be able to escape sand and climb a few blocks up even out of water. Would love climbing through small places and when seeing soul sand bubbles it would reach out a tentacle and touch the bubbles playing with them. Rare mobs hard to find. But if you can find one without being noticed it would be the most amazing thing ever.&nbsp;To the mojang team,have fun finding ways to show the shy yet curious nature of the octopusto the artists, though it may be hard making a well made blocky form for this creature, think of all the cute animations you can make. I for one think these guys if done right can be the cutest things in Minecraft (maybe cuter than bees 😉).to the coders. Wow this may seem like a tough project you may think and it is, but you can also code in some cool behaviors for this creature (octopus use tools, camouflage, pop of their own arms etc.) octopus are very cool and unique creaturesoctopus may be one of the best non hostile animal that could be added to Minecraft.</p>",

But how about! Add more some scary stuffs like ghost .... or a decapitated mobs .......  an under water skeletons, a fire hounds and add some boss in nether to make the nether more exciting like in terraria my dream is to make the the terraria looks 3d because of what the bosses terraria have! ... and I look to minecraft! And think! What if minecraft add some over powered boss to make the game long lasting and hard to go to end! Add more boss I repeatedly .... please add more boss mobs !

When a player reaches the circle radius of the Croc, it will leap 2 blocks forward and bite the player, losing half their health if they are at the very edge of the water, and only a quarter health if they are hit at the tip. Crocodiles are very fast swimmers that can outswim you if your traveling long distances without a boat. On land, Crocs are very slow but can still bite you for a quarter of your health if you get bit. With a boat, if you swim on top of a Croc, they have the ability to knock you out of the boat and turn it into an item you must pick up.</p>\n<p>Another user suggested this but its optional.</p>\n<p>Crocodiles drop Reptile Leather which can be used to make a new armor variant.

After that period it would produce a chick, and then both would exit the hollow, although maybe there could some kind of option to collect the parent and chick when they are ready to leave (there should be something to notify the player when they are ready to leave the hollow) so they don't both go wandering about.</p>",

This game provides a beautiful way for a father and son to bond through creativity and adventure. I enjoy exploring deep into caves, and my son builds animal farms with the most amazing buildings and sculptures. It’s really meaningful to me when we venture into a new forest or abandon mine together.</p>\n\n<p>I’m hoping you can help me with a problem. When we go on adventures, bringing a pet dog helps my son to be brave, and it’s a deeply sad experience for him, if his pet dies on our excursion. He and I would really love to see an option in peaceful mode where pets don’t die.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you</p>",

They're current following ai is really stupid and they can't reasonably be taken anywhere because they'll die. They're essentially useless right now because the original idea for them is un useable and unreliable. The other option, sitting, is boring and lifeless, and thats not how animals act. I often built sanctuaries for foxes in the game, usually a park with no fences that they free roam, i want pets to be like this! I want to wander around my builds and happily run into them running around the area! Please add a 3rd mode, im begging for this.

They should be funny, happy and playful with players and other mobs; but their parents will try to attack you if you get to close or harm the babies. If the whole family is tame, then they won't attack and will instead be friendly. They should also attack hostile mobs to defend their babies, and if the player keeps their babies safe alongside them (showing them that you care for them), they will give you a BIG Elephant thank-you. It would also be great to ride Elephants when tamed. If that was added, it would be a great, friendly addition to the game and be the BEST UPDATE EVER</p>",

These would be the only thing that the 'Poachers' want, however, ivory could also be obtained by right clicking the elephant's tusk with a Diamond hoe or Axe. This will allow players to obtain those items without violence. And maybe the Elephants could only be tamed by killing a 'Poacher' illager near them. Once you do tame them, you could decorate them with carpet. In real life, Elephants knock down tree to get the leaves, as well as tearing leaves from trees to eat. To make sure that savannas aren't stripped of trees, they would plant a sapling in its place. So, they could become wood farms, adding much more uses. They should spawn in savanna and jungle biomes, African and Indian elephants respectively. As Elephants are extremely intelligent, this would make sense to give them more complex behaviors. When an elephant is angered, it can enter charge mode, where it can break most weaker blocks. (Cobblestone, wood, leaves, glass). </p>",

This implementation will discourage ivory harvesting and create a distaste toward poachers, who will try their best to kill your elephant. This will help raise awareness for actual poaching, and will not glorify ivory harvesting.&nbsp;</p>",

I think similar to bees they should have cocoon blocks which can be mined for string. Cocoons can spawn in any flower filled biome, and after about a day or so, they hatch and spawn a butterfly or two. If mined before hand with silk touch, you can place it somewhere and the butterflies that spawn from it will stay in the area without despawning, so long as they have flowers nearby. If there are both flowers nearby, and trees to nest on, then they will continue to spawn more cocoons on the trees. Butterflies could be able to use nectar from flowers, to do an effect similar to bonemeal, where they spread the growth of flowers. As well as bees and spiders attacking butterflies. When killed, have a chance to drop butterfly wings, which can be placed in an item frame as a decoration. Make maybe 5-10 different looking wings to make them collectable in game. These are just my thoughts, id love the idea.</p>",

Second you should be able to catch the butterflies with nets like you can catch fish with buckets. This will make it so that the butterfly you catch won't despawn. Lastly butterflies should land on trees and your head if you are standing still. That is all I have to say aND thank you for your time.</p>",

But maybe you could even track the herd with a compass, so you could stay with them until you feel as if you have enough food.</p>\n<p>Another thing is that they should be able to jump over 3 block heights and pits, so you couldn’t just trap them. They would be designed to evade and have you lose your stamina.</p>\n<p>Finally, I think that they would interact with one another if not disturbed. The males could joust and spar with each other, the females would graze, and the babies would chase other kids around the group.

They follow the cat that's dominant to them, and if it's a non tamed cat will kill anyone who goes to close, and the cat or lions that follow cat can no longer be tamed. Its add some nice redstone defences and features, also they need a separate mob for dominant lion and if theres 2 nearby maybe have them fight until one dies, which then it doesnt die but becomes a regular lion instead. If a dominant lion trusts you then all lions you make via breeding another lion with it will also trust you unless you kill a dominant lion in the pack, adding a unique taming system for them</p>",

There should be a widened sight rang that they can't see you looting. Or maybe they do see but it's a prolonged amount of time that they don't attack you. Also with this being implemented, we should add a jukebox to the loot table. Maybe make it a weight of 5? But not too common as it does require a diamond.</p>",

Along with rats, capybaras, kangaroos and maybe a few others. <br>But foxes already are in the game! So why not make them be pets? <br>Tame foxes with similar traits to dogs do exist, but only after a long process of domestication! <br>So I think you should be able to tame foxes after a while, maybe it would even take 2 or 3 generations in order to get your actual pet fox! <br>Right now you can get a fox to trust you if you helped it get conceived. What if you breed two trusting foxes? I think the resulting baby fox should be naturally more likely to want to follow you! And its offspring? They will hunt for you and bring you their kill! And their offspring could carry items for you and give them back when you right click them, also making your fox sit on the spot! :D</p>\n<p>Just some ideas ;)&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br>I think the fox pet shouldn't be as easy to get as cats and dogs, because foxes are wild animals after all! But I do think they should be tamable in the same way cats and dogs can!</p>",

I personally like that, while they do trust you, they don't fully rely on you. It makes them more interesting and dynamic, able to do more without just being tamed and sitting around like wolves. Them being trusting but not tameable makes them way more fun to watch and interact with.&nbsp;</p>",

That common idea of showing them as unwanted nasty animals should be erased from any book, they are very helpful in very various way like regulating wild rats population.

Some people suggest chicken, others suggest berries. Either (or maybe both) are fine.</p>\n<p>I do not believe a pet mob should ever be decorative, so I don't just want them tame for taming sake. I also don't think having them just be the same as wolves is good, because then why have wolves? They shouldn't help hunt like wolves do, but should instead pick up items for you.</p>\n<p>Finally, since cats scare creepers, and dogs scare skeletons, I think foxes should scare spiders. While I said before that realism is not a strong basis for Minecraft, this is a minor call back to the fact that foxes in reality are omnivorous and eat bugs.</p>",

First I think that tamed foxes can either stay the same color, or possible change to more domesticated colors, like brown, tan, or even (on rare occasions) A mix, like a marble fox (look it up). I like the idea of tamed foxes picking up items and even hunting, maybe have different items at different times of the day or difference in rarity. I also think since cats sit at random, and parrots dance to music, maybe foxes could just randomly wonder off, but come back with in ten-fifteen minutes(maybe this could be when they hunt). Another idea i had, which probably won't be put into the game, is maybe foxes can go unnoticed by certain mobs, or even be able to turn partial or even wholly invisible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I also agree with some or what the people are saying below about the foxes, make sure to check out what they've got to say aswell, and even give them a vote if you like the idea as well.</p>",

When I played Minecraft nearly 10 years ago at the time of its birth I watched the game flourish. As time went on I became obsessed with the iron giants and the many pumpkin wearing snowman that I had parade around my base. Eventually I was able to semi automate the process with redstone, pistons, and a dispenser block. Creating my own armies at my fingertips. Using snow golems and iron golems as assistants for redstone contraptions of my own. Involving pressure plates and newer blocks like trip wires or heavier pressure plates. The copper golem was introduced as the third and smallest but powerful member of a class of helpful mobs that have existed from the very beginning. With a newly introduced metal with very little uses at the moment aside from cosmetic building, lightning redirection, or a very hand spy glass, the copper golem seemed perfect to make use of all the copper in the overworld. Let's face it, you only need so many spyglasses and so many lightning rods. I'm sure that Mojang has other things planned for copper. But none will ever replace the idea of a button touching, 1x1x1 copper buddy that rusts in weather and adds to the band of mobs that have been a duo since the beginning. What I want as much as many others in this community, is to see a trio come to fruition. We want to see the copper golem enter the world and worlds we've been in, created by our own blocky hands.</p>",

Punch cards, programmed in a keypunch block, provide the golem with step-by-step instructions, allowing it to perform a variety of tasks. You can name the punch cards when you program it, so you will know what it does. Copper golems could be used for automatic farms, weapon defense systems, storage sorting, and so much more.</p>\n<p>This would need to include cameras which can be activated by redstone, copper pipes, copper conveyor belts for allays, observers being able to observe if a plant is fully grown, dispensers being able to use any tool and plant seeds, and copper hoppers which do not remove items out of chests unless that specific item has been requested.</p>",

Your right about the wither storm boss cause we've never had a new boss being added to minecraft Java/bedrock/PS4 edition for a very very VERY long time sense we've first got the ender dragon or the playing old wither boss sense the day before the Xbox 360 or the PS3/PS4/PS vita edition came out. But the wither storm? This, I've got to see cause I've been waiting for mojang to tell us when the wither storm boss be added to minecraft. All that I've herd from O1G (you know, that youtuber on YouTube) when he first talk to telltale and mojang is that \"It is possible if the community really wants that\". But mojang didn't talk about how the wither storm will work or how it will behaved tho. But either way, this could be a good idea for adventurers who likes to fight harder bosses and mobs. Good idea. Great idea! In-fact, awesome idea! You've deserved a thumbs up my friend! 👍</p>",

For the super TNT, you need an enchanted book of command block exposing in the middle, and sand all around. And finally. For the formidi bomb (which has also have the same teckniques as the super TNT), you need a super TNT in the middle, and gunpowder all around. It probably might not work that way but, eh, who knows. So that's my tutorial on how to craft them. Thanks for reading. 👋😀</p>",

If you want to spawn it you have to craft the wither storm just how you spawn it on the ground. And when you craft it you will get the wither storm spawn egg!!! This feature is going to be in java and bedrock edition!!!!!!! So I hope mojang adds this in the game or else... the game will not be exciting.</p>",

Though it would significantly increase the popularity of Minecraft, Mojang would probably need permission from Telltale games, which the Wither Storm basically belongs to for being an original antagonist. Here’s the thing, though Telltale is back, when they went bankrupt they lost the rights to Minecraft Story Mode, and when they emerged back, they never got those rights back. And if that happened, Minecraft might not even bother wanting to be involved with Telltale again. If it does happen, some issues need to be fixed. First, the command block doesn’t exist in any survival mode, it can only be spawned with creative mode, the recipe for the Formidi Bomb in MCSM doesn’t exist, and finally an actual way to defeat the storm. How would you go inside of it? I am not at ALL against the idea of adding the Wither Storm to Minecraft, there’s just some major issues Mojang has to fix before they ever do.</p>",

It can be found with it's whole body buried except the grassy top with gray stripes. You can tame it with any meat and ride it with a saddle. To fly you would just move forward in whatever direction you are looking.&nbsp;</p>",

Rising to the surface when players get near them. Maybe blow a burst of water from blowhole. Slap side fins or tail fins. Otherwise peaceful in all other aspects. Other fish would be drawn to them 'for feeding' i.e remoras.</p>\n<p>Maybe add a new decor block like barnacles which can be mined from them with a hand or pickaxe or chop kelp as they slowly pass through a kelp strand.. Can break Blue ice in cold biomes as they breach the surface. Feed them a raw fish to hear them 'sing'.</p>\n<p>It also matches the thoughts of the developers to bring awareness to the plight of these graceful animals in the real world. Please add to this with other useful ideas. No killing of the whales though. I get the idea of Blubber and its uses but that is what cause the overkilling of this species in the first place</p>",

Husky- Replaces the current “tamed wolf” skin. Functions the same as the current wolf.</p>\n\n<p>2. Boxer- The largest dog breed in the game. Has more health due to its large size.</p>\n\n<p>3. Pug- A lap dog. Chosen because PUGS ARE AWESOME. They cannot attack enemies, however they follow the player closer than most other dogs. They bark at nearby hostile mobs, even Creepers. </p>\n\n<p>4.Rottweiler- Same size as the Husky, Rottweilers have increased attack, due to their real life origins of hunting and attack dogs. </p>\n\n<p>5. Golden Retriever- Same size as the Husky, Golden Retrievers attack bird mobs (Chickens and Parrots) due to real life origins. </p>\n\n<p>6. Sheepdog- Based off the English sheepdog. They do not attack sheep, but they are able to chase, or “herd them” towards the player if any sheep are nearby. This can help if sheep have escaped from a player’s fenced enclosure.</p>\n\n<p>7. Schnauzer- A large terrier-type dog that was originally bred as a “rat-dog”. Hence, Schnauzers naturally target and attack Rabbits.</p>\n\n<p>8. Foxhound- Based off the American Foxhound. They naturally target and attack Foxes, and also have a great sense of smell. They can lead the player to nearby structures if fed meat, like Dolphins.</p>\n\n<p>9. Community Poll like with cats. Winner gets their dog’s breed in the game.</p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think?</p>",

They indiscriminately go after any mob except for players, tamed mobs, and creepers (unless the tamed mob attacks them). Even when tamed, Pit Bulls will turn on their owners if hit one too many times. Can be found by taming a wolf with pork, around pillager outposts, or in patrols; if the leader of the latter is killed, then the Pit Bull will become friendly and can be tamed by right-clicking it with an empty hand. Found in nearly any color sans merle.</p>\n<p><strong>Corgis: </strong>1-block sized dogs with decent enough attack power, though lacking in the health department. They herd livestock mobs (cows/mooshrooms, sheep, pigs, and chickens) into fenced areas; if there are no such areas nearby, then they simply round them up into a small area and keep them there. They also attack any non-player/non-tamed mobs who hurt such mobs. They can jump up to 2 and a half blocks, and can go after Phantoms. Pembroke/short-haired variants are found in plains and savanna villages, while Cardigan/long-haired ones are found in tundra and taiga villages. Both can also be obtained by feeding a wolf mutton. Pembrokes can be fawn, red, sable, and black tricolor, while Cardigans come in merle, black and white, sable, and red.</p>",

This is because people should know what type of dog they're looking at. Most people won't recognize a foxhound or a Schnauzer. So, I think the breeds should be: Golden Retriever, German Shepard, Border Collie (instead of sheepdog), Husky, and maybe Pug or a Hound. The functions should be different depending on the animal. For instance, the German Shepard should have better attack damage and health. The Border Collie should have the ability to herd other animals, maybe the pug can bring you stuff, or the Hound can hunt other mobs, whether hostile or not. And the Husky should be able to survive in the cold, while others can't. Or maybe be able to hook up to a sled team for mobility. All of the breeds should be chosen at random when taming a wolf.&nbsp;</p>",
