The plains variant has nothing strange...besides the more jagged terrain. The desert variant has a special type of sand called prism sand, as well as prism sandstone. These two blocks are very similar to bedrock in its texture, except that it is lighter in color...by about 25%. The horizon badlands are very spiked and are made out of cracked terracotta, made of many colors. The horizon ocean is made up of a blood-red liquid called harvor. This liquid has a few special properties. It gives you a small regeneration boost, but only while in the liquid. The horizon plateau is very hard to find, but is ideal for construction...assuming you don’t find it filled with craters, which is very common in this biome. The horizon cracks is a biome filled with colossal gaps in the floor, along with the occasional floating island as well. The phased forest is one of the two forests, and is filled with yellow-trunked tree-like flora. These flora are a transparent yellow, making them a little harder to see. The other forest is the rifted forest, filled with purple-hued “trees.” These flora have pitch black “leaves” that drop rifted apples, which are dark violet in color. They are edible, but can occasionally give you blindness.</p>",

The “ash grass” is a yellowish-grey color. The stone variant here is mainly a greenish hue. There are other stone variants, called slate and pumice. They all have respective slabs, stairs, and walls as well as bricks. There are a few ores here as well, namely mithril, atomic, uranium, plasma, and galactic. Each ore has its own uses and colors. Galactic mines exactly like diamond but has slightly more durability, so it is the diamond of the horizon. Uranium is sorta the gold of the horizon, as it mines fast, but has little durability. Plasma is the iron of this place, just with slightly more durability. Each tool does the same damage of their respective overworld counterparts. Atomic is basically the super fuel of the place, as it works like coal, except it burns a little dimmer than coal torches, as they can be crafted into atomic torches. They also smelt a stack of items per piece. Listen up redstone engineers, mithril is the alternative to redstone, so those wanting bluestone can be happier, as it does not connect with redstone. Converters are needed to swap types however, and are crafted with one mithril, one redstone, and one observer. They can only be crafted in the overworld because redstone cannot exist in the horizon. The horizon tool set is similar to stone, except is crafted with horizon stone, that greenish stone variant.</p>",

Any items that cannot be taken are not totally lost, as you will get them back when you go back to the overworld through a nether portal. Certain mobs can be found here as well, but they are more powerful than normal ones you are used to seeing. Zombies? No. Try increasing their size to 4 blocks and adding 3 more damage as well as 10 health. Skeletons? Nope. Increase their range by 32 blocks, give them ranged and melee capabilities, give them life, and call them corrupted elites. You really thought i would say spiders? Didn’t think you did. How about tarantulas? Sure, its a type of spider...except is 6 blocks in diameter and is 2 blocks high, as well as does extra damage...and doesn’t move unless you’re looking away. There are a few passive mobs, but they are hard to find and are actually neutral. Wart hogs, bison, and also moose roam these places as well as the occasional bobcat. I wish i could say more, but this post is already too long. I should stop here before i get any negative comments.</p>",

If it <strong>is</strong> dark, creepers spawn normally. They also don't spawn a certain radius around cats, so you can use them as sentries to protect the outside of your base.</p>\n<p>Pig-creeper hybrids: If you haven't seen the pictures of the glitched pigs that inspired the creeper, take a look at them now (google \"creeper pig origins\"). In honor of that glorious accident and the wild variety of creeper designs that followed, I think the COTW should have a collection of the mob's past skins, some pigs which are shaped like and behave like creepers but do not explode and drop pork on death, pig shaped creepers which wander like pigs but explode when near the players, and maybe even a few mobs which are part-pig, part-creeper.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Time: The test world is fully tropical, so the nights here are shorter than the days; clock textures change to adjust for this. There is time, but it is independent of the Overworld, so players can sleep separately on servers. Phantoms spawn as normal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

There are no diamonds, but since the Illagers never made it here, they didn't mine all of the emeralds out of the crust. Iron, coal, gold, lapis, and redstone can also be found as normal. Creeper dungeons will be found, as well as a new ore, textured similarly to stone, which explodes when broken. This ore spawns in veins, leading to chain reactions which can be fatal if the player doesn't have blast protection. If mined with silktouch, it doesn't explode and can be used for fantastic traps.</p>\n<p>Mineshafts also spawn in the COTW, but they are far from abandoned. The rails are repaired, and creepers and tnt in minecarts zoom around, ready to slam into the player. Hidden tripwires and pressure plates trigger minecart traps, or drop tnt minecarts from the ceiling. Emerald and redstone ores are very common here. Blast protection is as vital for exploring these mineshafts as milk is for exploring abandoned ones.</p>",
