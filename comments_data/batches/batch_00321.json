Granted a Fully enchanted Trident will deal less damage than a Fully enchanted bow and there is a bit of an extra delay between use of a Trident compared to a bow, but you need no ammunition to use the trident (which saves on an inventory slot) and you can get Mending I on it also, whereas with the bow, you have to choose if you want to fully enchant it between Mending I and Infinity I as you cannot have both.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So fully enchanted bows will make you choose either Infinite Ammo at the cost of it eventually breaking, or Finite Ammo with the ability to repair indefinately with more damage capability, whereas the Trident doesn't need ammo and can also get Mending at the cost of dealing less damage and a slightly longer delay at using again if it has Loyalty III. When compared to the bow, the Trident seems balanced, and that's not adding in the fact of Channeling I and enabling the ability to Supercharge Creepers XD.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And Tridents do have a damage buff that works on aquatic mobs, which is Impaling. If an enchantment of which you are asking was to be created to deal more general damage(Which I would picture being named Skewering), Impaling would need a rework to be appealing still.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for comparing a Trident to a Sword, I dunno. A sword is meant for close combat, whereas a Trident is meant to be used as a Ranged weapon, so I'm scratching my head at what you are asking for.</p>",

It's simple: Yes, the trident is meant for middle range, and swords, for close range, but, tridents are hard to get in JAVA edition. 6.25% for drowneds to spawn with a trident, and you have 8.5% to obtain one without looting. (11.5% looting III, still really low).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, with that being said, when you finally get one, let's be honest, do you use it more than a sword or than a bow for combat in general? Or you use it more to get mob heads and as a way of transport (riptide). That is the thing, you can ask many players about it, and the majority will answer they use it more for other things than for combat. Tridents are way cool to only use them for other purposes than combat. They are meant to use them for combat, but in a wrong way of ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As my point of view, they're not balanced for combat. They're slow, and deal less damage than a netherite sword, or a bow, fully enchanted. People will use them for combat because they like tridents, (like me) but not because they're a good option for it.</p>\n<p>If you make tridents hard to get, at least make them good to use (again, combat). And event if not for combat, you can use riptide a lot, but once you have elytras, what now? Now you can use them to get heads, but heads have zero uses except decoration, so again, what's up now? Why would i use them for if not because i like them? Elytras are literally a lot easier to get than tridents (just thinking about it... smh). ---</p>",

You drink one at sunset, you'll find it will keep the phantoms away all night. Now you can work uninterrupted from above! You are diligent in your project. On the fifth night something's...different. What was one phantom is now five! Ooh good grief!</p>\n<p>Drinking 3 things seem to be amiss. 70% total damage mitigation loss. Ok...but wait. I am having trouble functioning. All input from the player to what you see is delayed..five repeaters? 2 seconds. (might be overkill) Oh! and this lasts five minutes.</p>\n<p>Drinking 5 and you slowly lose health until you die. 1 in 20 chance you have half a heart remaining.</p>\n<p>When little Pat &amp; Kelly are at school and have 1 hour to play, I don't see it becoming a voluntary abuse. Pat thinks it's funny, but now Kelly can't do much, let alone defend anyone for five minutes. Thanks Pat...</p>\n<p>[Pat &amp; Kelly are the kids of the Villagers who somehow exist in reality.]</p>\n<p>When drinking Sake, color of itemframe will flash your level; nothing for days-in-a-row. Proc func loss creates a tone; think of a low bwaaah. (the bubble car in Wonka made a specific sound, like that.) This lets you know you made a mistake &amp; commemorates on your misfortune.</p>",

Then, after making the bars with something like eyes of ender you could combine it with diamonds at a smithing table (just like netherite) only these are just a bit stronger, perhaps they give you resistance or increase enchantments by one (if your diamond chest plate has protection IV it would buff it up to V, same with any enchantment) these higher enchants could NOT be acquired through any other means.
