(The effect is much lower with only one piece but highest with all amor pieces.)</p>\n\n<p> Almost like a radar effect and this could be a game changer!! :D but doesn't work in water, barely works in sand, etc.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;And why vibrations?? \n<br />When you are afflicted with Darkness you will still see waves or have vibrations on your controller when someone is near. Also this could easily be made into a sonar which will help you in very dark areas. Eliminating the need for a torch or a light source if you wanna live dangerously. :)  BUT doesn't work well on warden (to keep balancing under control)</p>\n\n<p> Also, added bonus this could be used to find ores maybe to give a distinct sound if you reach a certain ore. But you'll need full Skulk Armor to unlock the ore seismic sense. This could be a will be a fun incentive to go to the deep dark. And ore sense is weaker when you get to deepslate since it's a tougher material to feel vibrations from.</p>\n\n<p>What do ya'll think? #stealtharmy</p>",
