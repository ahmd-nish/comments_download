The left side of the display would show whether you are above or below sea level, using white or blue indicators, respectively.</p>\n<p>The right side of the display would show the colour codes for the most common ore at that Y level, as previously suggested.</p>\n<p>For the Multitool, it would retain the Y level on the top half, however, the bottom half would have three slits akin to the front of a Blast Furnace.</p>\n<p>The left slit would indicate whether you're able to sleep or not - based on time, not thunderstorms - with yellow for daytime and a light grey for nighttime. The centre slit would once again indicate the most common ores, as previously described. The right slit would contain the sea level indicator with the prior colour code described.</p>\n<p>Finally, around the Multitool, in a circle, there would be a red indicator that travels around in a circle around the texture, always pointing towards North (or, more accurately, 0,0).</p>\n<p>I do think that the Multitool would be best implemented with individual overlay layers for each variation over the base texture, rather than many individual textures.</p>",

I'm sorry but as things get updated and more performance intensive, you need to upgrade your older rigs. Besides, support for OpenGL isn't hard to come by, and you'll have trouble playing in 1.17 release without at least something to keep up with the system requirements. </p>",
