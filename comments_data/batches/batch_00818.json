There is no trees I think that they should add a new type of tree in the biome. The mushroom tree things are nice but u can't do anything besides kill or shear a mooshroom or other animals in that biome and get mushrooms from the mooshroom tree things. They also add structures in the biome. No structures (apart from buried treasure) are able to generate in the mooshroom biome. There are generated structures in every biome (in the overworld) except the mooshroom biome. For example villages spawn in plains, savannas, taigas, desert, and the snow biome (forgot what it is called). Yes I am leaving out some biomes but most of them are sub biomes, but I haven't mentioned the mesa biome, this is because there are no villages but there are mineshafts and mineshafts spawn in every biome except the ocean biomes(and mooshroom I think). But ocean biomes have shipwrecks and ancient ruins. That leaves us with the mooshroom biome the emptiest biome of all in terms of structures. This is why I want a new structure and trees(or just other ones to start spawning in it) in the mooshroom biome.</p>",

When I started looking into the storyline of minecraft I started in 1.16 close to the time when they announced caves and cliffs. For me it seemed more like the poor souls are trapped. Possibly its victims that it had used as an energy source for itself making itself stringer. Also the souls in this game do not seem like they are planning something evil. For example the soul sand valley traps souls and although ghasts are souls that breath fireballs at you and they could be trapped for a good reason kind of does not stop my idea because the souls also seem innocent for other reasons. For example the souls seem to have nothing to do with attacking you unless released or created with the soul sand or the evokers. It could be possible that some are good some are evil. But also paying more attention directly to the warden the warden also has other reasons to being evil. It might want to trap the souls for possibly evil reasons but in the process trapping innocent souls and in that case hunting you down. I have a theory on why they would think you are evil but that would make the comment to long.</p>",

Some children cut pieces of it off and pretended to have mustaches, some played tug of war with it, others ate it. However, those children that interacted with it the most began to feel rashes, and their skin grayed, some fell terribly ill and recovered but had forever lost the color of their skin, others stood little chance of surviving. No one knew what was causing the illnesses, until parents realized that the hair on the wall was almost as recent as the illnesses. That is when the civilization began to panic. People blamed others for their child's death, some abandoned the civilization and were never heard of again. But the leader called for peace, and told them that they were to migrate to a new cavern. So they did, they all migrated, but the hair was everywhere. If they settled down to rest, for several hours, the hair would be there again. This was beginning to worry the leader greatly, so he picked up the pace. They traveled many, many kilometers. Some people left the tribe to find a place for themselves...</p>",

And they had delusions that they should lick everything inanimate, and that they were going to be okay without the others. Eventually they had little affection left for the others. Soon they heard faint sounds everywhere, they could pinpoint where all sounds came from with remarkable efficacy. They knew that if dripstone had fallen, they could get a scrumptious licking from it. Eventually, they felt taped into another source of energy, and stopped eating mushrooms and bats. Most emotions had left them, fear among them, but old memories stayed, though they were faint and little remained. They were mostly major parts of their life, and those memories were strong enough to elicit just a drop of emotion. Soon enough their eyes were so sensitive to light, that they used no light. Their state of self did not matter to them anymore. Soon they felt random intense bouts of aggression. It usually corresponded to a strange absence of sounds coming from a place where water could usually be heard dripping, and so they wander over to investigate that place. It did not feel new to feel this way over an absence of a portion of their hearing. But the memories did.</p>",
