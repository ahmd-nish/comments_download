The addition of volcanoes may require a surrounding biome, Lava Plains! Areas of bare tuff laced with lava pools and streams. Some volcanoes could also have secondary/tertiary vents. Large deposits of ore could be located under volcanoes, as gemstones are created by cooling of magma within the earth's crust.</p>\n<p>Another idea branching off of this is volcanic mud pools and geothermal springs with geysers nearby. Geysers would work by this model: when a player or mob walks over them, they emit a hissing noise, deal the entity four damage points (two hearts), and propel them eight blocks into the air. Geothermal spring walls could also contain deposits of a new gemstone: opal, which is often found near geothermal springs irl. Stair and slab variants would be included, and I could see it being used as a building block. Volcanic mud would suck players into it and deal a small amount of burn damage, it would look like dirt but be darker and slightly desaturated.</p>",

However, the notion I forgot to mention and ran out of room for but was going to provide is that tin should replace items in the game which currently require iron yet require a good deal of it (including rails, redstone pieces like hoppers and trapdoors, etc.). Utilizing the openness of the new large antechambers found deep underground, iron would still be rendered easy to get, as I believe it would generate all throughout those. In addition, tin buckets I believe would be a good idea, but the main difference is that they cannot hold lava, making the player reach deep into the caves before using such a harsh element. Other than tools and armor, I think these should stick with iron: flint and steel, proper buckets, pistons, minecarts, cauldrons, etc.). Essentially, my idea is that because the bronze age came first, and bronze is generally a weaker metal than iron, that there should be an intermediary stage between having nothing to quickly getting iron. This would render all simple low-level items, such as leather armor, stone tools, and other easy-to-come-by items as being more useful. Finally, as a note on generation, I feel like tin should generate throughout the whole world but iron would be below around y = 30 (of course, now noting the extension downwards).</p>",
