These could all be used to make stone tools (including the stone types already in game) and depending on the type of stone, how much durability the tool has. Shale could be mixed with water to make clay. Talc could make white dye. Pumice could be used to scrub stuff like removing moss from mossy blocks. Crushed shale and limestone could be used to make cement.</p>",
