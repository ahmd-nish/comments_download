I very heavily assume that Mojang and Microsoft will not be permanently banning players for one small, minor offense(such as saying a single or a few bad words). If players would continuously be rude to others on a high level and have several warnings by admins, then they may be banned, but not on a scale that the average child or adult would achieve. Also, the new system of universal banning will definitely not delete single player worlds, only restrict online activity.</p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: I do not work on Minecraft, but based upon strong reasoning, I believe they are not trying to make Minecraft an unplayable or unenjoyable game, just pushing out the people that try to do just that.</p>",

I wish there was at least a command for issuing permissions individually- It really does seem like a downgrade (considering [Name of Console] Edition had individual permissions) and it should be the next big thing for Realms because they honestly work very well regardless of where I want to play- I just wish I could make it so people can fly around and explore places with doors and stuff without worrying that they'll destroy 10 years of building progress while doing so.</p>",

It's quite annoying having to scroll past the 8 random servers each time to get to mine. I'm assuming the featured servers are paid to be put on the front page there. Maybe separate custom servers from the integrated Bedrock servers as they still seem vital for console players. Or add custom servers to the \"Worlds\" tab. Console server navigation doesn't seem the best from reading other comments, a proper server browser would probably be a better overall solution given all above problems.</p>",

As the host of a realm I feel it is my obligation to give players the best environmet for comfortable gameplay. Being able to donate to your favorite realm would ensure its longevity. This is something I attempted to do via a paypal money pool and a discord community to no avail. If it was a direct payment to the realm itself without involving a third party that could potentially be misuesd I think most people would feel more confident in donating. It would also be very cool to customize names in chat with colors so you can display you are a donator. No in game items or such that violate the EULA, just a visual thing to show everyone your a supporter of the realm you are currently in. As far as player cap otions, I feel like it should be more along these lines, 5 replacing the 2 player option), 10 as it is now, 20 for about twice the amount as the 10 player option and then beyond that have it be more of an incremental scale going up by 2 slots for a fixed amount of money. this would be amazing for those larger realms who get a ton of traffic.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
