Rain, for example, could have a chance in different biomes with different strength (strong rain, rain, light rain, drizzle). Maybe even adding fog as a kind of weather phenomenon. Hail is a thing that can also be added. For example: if you walk during hail without a helmet, pieces of ice will cause little damage.”</p>\n\n<p>This is actually pretty good! Although, I will say that I don’t like the idea of hail dealing damage.</p>",

Some people spend hours and hours to come up with a beautiful build in one world, and when they start a new world, they're forced to recreate it, or create something new. For those who are less artistically inclined, it can be really frustrating to try to come up with good-looking structures again and again. Many people resort to youtube tutorials, which is a clunky crutch. I would love Minecraft to support this in-game, much like Kerbal Space Program did when they started letting you save your creations to the cloud and load them into any game. For many players, FLYING the rockets was much more fun than designing them, especially designing the SAME one over and over. I feel like it's the same in Minecraft. USING the structure can be much more fun than designing it, particularly if you're designing the same one over and over.</p>\n<p>The details of exactly how something like this might be implemented is less important than simply having a way to save the CREATIVE work you've done, and possibly share it with others. Some people have suggested having a blue/ghosted visible structure that you can fill in with the proper (or even different) blocks. Others have suggested some system where you can provide all the required materials and then simply place the structure as desired (without having to do the work of actually placing every block). I'm voting for whatever method is easiest for developers to implement!</p>",

Are you suggesting taking a mortal risk for a resource that many consider \"junk\"? <br>2.Size. How many mobs do you know that are bigger than the iron golem? They levitate ugly, standing on the edges of the blocks, this is a problem. <br>All in all, I suggest moving this opponent to another structure where we could SPEND redstone dust to get to something of value. Let's say an ancient obsidian treasure vault, occupied by illagers and a golem. We will need to repair the damaged redstone chains in order to go deeper. The golem will get in our way so we can't just punch holes in the walls. <br>And the large size of the golem will become a \"feature\", it will not be able to crawl into holes in the floor and walls, and the player will attack from there.</p>",

You either attempt to flee, and likely die trying, or you let it kill you.</p>\n<p>This change just gives players a 3rd option in which they can continue to loot and explore the new structure, but with much greater risk - which should only heighten the experience. It'll also encourage more players to engage with the new Deep Dark content, if there is a counter-play they can make that means death isn't all but ensured.<br>Even if the player&nbsp;<em>can</em> escape with their lives, they'd still get a good scare out of such a close call, so I don't think it'd undermine The Warden's purpose in the slightest.</p>",
