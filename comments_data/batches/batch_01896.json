        "body": "<p>I have a few issues with how Chiselled Bookshelves act in 22w42a.</p>\n<p>First, I don't like that you always take out the last book, it makes getting just one book out of the shelves extremely annoying, especially if it's the first enchanted book of the six, as that's six unstackable items, and you then have to put them back in.</p>\n<p>Second, on a similar concept, I don't like how there's only one front texture regardless of which book is put in. It would make library builds quite annoying to find a specific book type in. Perhaps if there was some way to have it so depending on the book, it'll have a different design, allowing for all enchanted books, written books, writable books/book and quills, and plain books, to be recognizable at a glance, and combined with the first part, pulled out when needed.</p>\n<p>As a combination thought of those two ideas, possibly hovering over a book in a bookshelf could show you the name, if renamed (or a named written book), or the enchantment for enchanted books? It could get slightly intrusive, but item frames have something similar already.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, the sound books make is oddly clunky to me, sounds way more wooden than I'd expect, it could be a bit softer feeling to represent the sounds of paper hitting the shelf, rather than what feels like wood hitting wood.</p>\n<p>The feature definitely has a lot of potential, but it feels a bit overly restricted as it is currently.</p>",

This is a really awful design choice imo. Either you should be able to remove the book that your crosshair is over, or give it an inventory that you can open. With the latter option, you can also hover over the book to see what it is without removing it which would be useful.</p>\n<p>- I think it would be better if the bookshelf could hold 10 books that are each two pixels wide with a gap between them instead of only 6 books (or even 12 with no gaps) as this would make them more useful for storage as well as decoration.</p>\n<p>- It would be cool if enchanted books have an enchantment glint when they are on the bookshelf, or another way to differentiate enchanted books from regular books.</p>\n<p>- With the introduction of the chiseled bookshelf I think it is about time to add bookshelves for each wood variant</p>",

As for the books, I think that, as some have said here, each one has to have a unique texture so that we can identify them on the shelf or even a way to customize them and we can only take out the book that the mouse is pointing to not having to empty the shelf to take out the last book.</span></pre>",

Make it interact with redstone.\n<br />If you could be able to put items in and out with hopper(minecarts), dispensers, then you can for example easily improve for the door showed in Minecraft Live by being able to put the book in a hopper on the other side of the door and that goes back to the chiseled bookshelf to refill it and close the door again. This allowes you to easily create a system to close the door at any time you want. For example if you want to let more people through you won't be annoyed by having a too short clock to let everyone through. Another example is to easily sort enchanted from a farm so people that aren't so good at redstone don't have to watch a complicated tutorial about that.\n<br />2. Being able to put/take books somewhere else than the first available/full spot. (Only when they are manually put in the bookshelf)\n<br />This could be done by if you look at the spot on the bookshelf while your putting the book in it goes there, when the spot is full you get the book that was there\n<br />This is good for decoration purposes and maybe people that maybe want to create pixel art with it.\n<br />3. When you rename a book and put it in the bookshelf a name tag will pop up if you look at it or are in a particular range from the bookshelf. \n<br />This could help with finding a book back when you have a lot of books stored.</p>",

Which honestly is my biggest hope for this block is an update on enchanting.

This would also be a way to add treasure enchants to random enchanting. There are 32 spaces around a table. It takes 15 shelves to achieve max power with 17 for chiseled shelves/entrance/decor. With 33 Enchants available at 6 slots per chiseled a max of 102 Enchanted books could be used to give players some control of enchanting. And makes a purpose to grind enchanting books for better returns.</p>\n<p>-Increasing the Max Level for spells is a popular idea but I get it could present balance issues. It would be neat to have max levels be a world-generation option. As well as disabling Enchants allowed.&nbsp;</p>",

Some of the comments suggest linking rafts together, which is a great idea. Personally I think they should be faster and, as a trade off, only allow one person to sit in them. Or you can have them move faster and, as a trade off, they can break when you run into stuff at full speed. Just some ideas. But please give consideration to adding a new boat mechanism to these rafts and not just be the same functionality as every other boat.</p>",

Plus its texture is kind of divided in for pieces which doesn't make sense at all. Like, I get what you tried to make. It could be perfectly used as an old-fashion floor, but it looks weird for me. I don't like it personally. As it's quite useless even as a decorative block, I think it's extra and it should be deleted from the game. Thanks!</p>",

I think representing at least one of these would be better, though I'm partial to giving the smoker an exclusive recipe for drying bamboo blocks. Maybe a system like copper weathering as others have suggested, or using slime balls similarly to honeycomb.</p>\n<p>2)Block of Bamboo is not a storage block.</p>\n<p>Block of Bamboo should craft 9 Bamboo. This block should also be renamed to Bamboo \"Bundle\" (think Hay \"Bale\"). It can still be dried for the yellow texture. Bamboo Planks can now be crafted with 4 Bamboo Bundles.</p>\n<p>3)No green Bamboo Planks/Slabs/Stairs</p>\n<p>I think the current plank palette is sorely lacking green, so rename Bamboo Planks to Dried Bamboo Planks and add 3 blocks using the existing green texture. Also, I think Bamboo Mosaic should be the alternative to Planks in crafting (meaning no need for a green door, button, etc). Bamboo IRL needs to be cut into strips and pressed together to emulate hardwood lumber. Maybe rename Mosaic to Planks for clarity, and Planks to Mosaic, Slatted, or Split Bamboo.</p>\n<p>4)No green Bamboo Fence</p>\n<p>Personal gripe.

You are doing a great job at both adding new features and continuing to make the game feel like Minecraft!</p>\n\n<p>Something that would be really cool to see, though, is being able to use the bamboo stalk itself as a block. While there are so many variants of this block, which are really cool to have, it would be interesting to be able to use the stalks after harvesting as is possible in real life. I think this would open many new doors for creators to encorporate into their builds, particularly if there were also a stripped bamboo variety.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for all your work!</p>",

Hanging signs can barely fit any text(this may be purposeful, but it makes regular signs more functional</p>\n<p>3. In general, I think hanging signs would look better if they did not use chains. Also by using a cheaper block, it would make it feasible to use them in survival(as iron chains are far more expensive to craft than a stick for a regular sign).</p>\n<p>All in all, the hanging sign seems like a good way to change up the old idea of signs in Minecraft</p>",

We can easily leave a blank on one side much like how you can make a blank regular Sign. It is great for navigation signs where the arrow is different on one side compare to the other, or have \"Welcome!\" on one side and \"See You Soon\" on the other side.</li>\n<li>On Bedrock, the text size is small for Hanging Signs, making it difficult to see from any distance, even when close up. It should be at least readable.</li>\n<li>On Java, the font size is good but you do lose characters per line compare to regular Signs. I think it should have a few more characters to nearly match regular Signs. Also the image of the sign when you enter text to the Hanging Sign is small unlike Bedrock.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

However, this does not happen when you say “garden hoe(s)” instead. But you run out of space. If possible, could we fix this? </p>\n\n<p>Also, when writing a sign, you must go to the following line to save your work. So, for example, if I write “Garden Hoes and Shovels” on line one, I must proceed to line two to keep my work before exiting. Perhaps, we’ll be able to fix this? Thank you!</p>",

        "body": "<p>A common player complaint is that Mojang kept adding useless decos, and this update's yet another aesthetic update. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a builder and I love hanging signs, pots, and cherry blossoms! But the devs focus too much on intrinsic player motivation, and there's almost no extrinsic motivation anymore (such as building for survival, raiding dungeons to get useful loot). Nether update's the only exception. Deep Dark's great, but the unique loot like the compass is not that useful &amp; too gimmicky.</p>\n\n<p>When I first played Minecraft, that rush of making your first base to protect yourself from scary monsters, farming to sate my hunger, and exploring to get better gear, that extrinsic motivation feels great and addicting! The intrinsic motivation of making a beautiful survival base is a cherry-on-top. But nowadays, most additions are just useless things like the Sniffer's flowers. They're great for deco but have no survival use. And survival is why I buy Minecraft. I don't want a 3D app like Blender, I want a game. </p>\n\n<p>On top of that, the long-awaited mobile controls from 1.19 ended up bad, there's still no way to customize your button size/position &amp; HUD, even though players kept asking for it. If I have customizable buttons on-screen that allows me to quickly switch to my torch (or food, or anything else), use it, and return to my tool, that'd feel great, instead of slowly tapping the tiny hotbar. Every good mobile game has button customization, except Minecraft.</p>",

I hope for brown autumn leaves in the future, with falling leaf particles. Please add ambient sounds like crickets, sea waves, caves echo etc. I was hoping for a green wood set with bamboo as we're lacking green fences/stairs.</p>\n\n<p>Wandering traders should sell his unique armor trim as he's useless. Elder Guardian's armor trim drop rate is too low, and finding them can take 10k+ blocks. While the armor trims encourage exploration by giving unique structure loot, save file bloat discourages exploration especially on mobile/consoles. I find myself not wanting to explore &amp; play the game, because as the file size goes into gigabytes, the game on bedrock starts to lag &amp; crash. This lack of adventure makes me quit the game. What if there's roguelike temporary dimensions where you can go into a randomized dungeon world, fight the boss &amp; get loot, then repeat? The End update is a perfect opportunity for this, fitting the dimension-hopping theme. What about magic wands &amp; robes like Minecraft Dungeons? Everyone's using diamond gear with no variety.</p>\n\n<p>Mojang is too afraid of making big meaningful changes &amp; prefers \"safe\" but boring aesthetic updates. Many players wanted bosses &amp; new dimensions with useful loot. Adventure needs dangerous areas with mobs like dragons &amp; sea leviathans. Lately though, this 1.20 update has been boring. Still, thank you devs for the update!</p>",

One thing that the community has already said and I notice that it is true, mojang is making the game more boring, with few varieties. Mobs are often peaceful and do not give players rewards when defeated. Goats, shiny squid, allays, sniffer, camels, axolotl, warden. What do all these mobs have in common? They are peaceful, have almost no interesting functions or have no drops. You can ride camels, but he is worse than the horse because he is slower, which is bad enough. Allay, serves a few times to pick up items nearby, and you barely use it. The game needs more challenges, like the combat snapshots that Jeb_ took in version 1.16. Where is all that interaction with other players that he released years ago? Is it in the basement of ideas thrown out of mojang? I'm still waiting for that combat update</p>",

I really really agree that there's too much useless decorations, if only we can brew new potions with sniffer flowers, then it'd at least have some survival use.</p>\n<p>Minecraft caters too much to builders, but I buy the game due to its open world rpg nature.... I want tough battles, dungeons, new weapons and gear. I want to live in a cool base but I don't have time to spend weeks watching building tutorials and gather materials, and so I prefer to live in structures like mansions. Not everyone is a creative builder and they shouldn't be forced to build. It gets boring though, if only there's a builder villager NPC that helps me spawn cool bases immediately.</p>\n<p>Oh, and please remove the double-click crafting on mobile that's added in 1.19 to 1.20. For example, if you want to craft two buttons, you might click twice, but with the new double click crafting, you are likely to craft an entire stack of buttons and wasting materials. The old method of hold-tap to craft stack is much better.</p>",

I think I can speak for the whole Minecraft Community if I say, that we're are extremely disappointed in this update. The Minecraft updates you have been delivering us are getting worse and worse since 1.16. You call yourself a videogame company but all you do is add such a small amount of additions after ONE YEAR of work?! Come on! Minecraft Mod developers are doing more and most of them don't even have a developing team! I get that you are currently working on other projects but that doesn't mean, that you can just neglect Minecraft Java. I have been enjoying Minecraft for more than nine years and it's sad to see Minecraft slowly dying. I would go as far as to say that Notch selling Minecraft was one of the worst mistakes in videogame history. He really tried hard to keep the players entertained with weekly updates that were actually fun. After that Minecraft became more professional and there were loads of really cool updates. Compared to the present you have increased in developers and decreased in creativity and innovation. If you don't keep up with other videogames you are going to fall behind and Microsoft will regret its purchase. Minecraft is in danger!

Ambience is one of Minecraft's biggest flaws and it NEEDS better ambience, but the biome just feels empty and will quickly grow boring as a result.</p>\n<p>Sniffer: I voted for sniffers, but its the worst part of the update--tedious to find only for it to give two flowers used exclusively to decorate.</p>\n<p>Smithing Table/Trims: good, but trims should provide minor effects like speed, damage, durability boosts, etc for the armor they're applied to, giving players actual reasons to find them beyond \"they look cool.\" Maybe armor upgrading could be integral to the game--armors have abilities that stack when upgraded adding variation to combat (adding copper/emerald armor would help).</p>\n<p>Archeology: interesting idea, but the loot isn't good enough for me to go out of my way to slowly dig through gobs of sand/gravel. The pots are really cool, but they need more variation (add colors or different pot sizes). The loot for archeology also needs more unique variation, maybe new decoration items, new weapons (which could help revamp combat), etc.</p>\n<p>The additional blocks (shelves, bamboo, signs, etc) are cool, but these updates are all the same: add new blocks but change nothing big about the gameplay.

Number two, armor coatings/shines! So you know how enchanting armor makes it shiny? I'm thinking of something similar. just think of armor with an orange shine on it! Some items that could be used for this are, magma cream for a gradient of orange and green, dragon's breath for white and purple, echo shard for dark blue, ender eye/ender pearl for dark blue and teal, and glow ink sac to make the armor glow in the dark! I would love to see these ideas in game. Once again, this is a great update but there could be more!</p>",

I like Minecraft because of the freedom to explore an infinite 3D world where you can place blocks anywhere, and also the extrinsic motivations like survival, adventure for useful loot, battles/bosses. No other game in the world has this, they lack the freedom &amp; most Minecraft knockoffs are mediocre. Bedrock doesn't have mods, so I need to rely on vanilla being good.</p>\n\n<p>I love intrinsics, but the extrinsics are what made Minecraft this popular, creating youtube let's play reactions like getting scared by Wardens &amp; feeling accomplished after defeating a boss. They're not mutually exclusive! We can have dungeons with tough mobs &amp; useful rewards, where players have to make a choice to enter, not like phantoms harassing you everywhere as you build. We can give Sniffer flowers a survival use, not just decor. It's bad argument saying extrinsics are somehow ruining the sandbox, and justify adding useless items like goat horns &amp; glow ink sacs, again &amp; again.</p>\n\n<p>All I do lately is build, build. That extrinsic reason that made me enjoy Minecraft is gone. So I've quit the game. I've decided that Minecraft needs competition. Hytale understands how to balance intrinsics &amp; extrinsics, it's only a matter of time until players compare both games' updates, where one adds 2 useless mobs after a year, and the other adds meaningful additions.</p>",

Something like the Ruby may be a nice callback (fits with the ancient theme!), while providing nothing more than a trophy item (it would just be a collectable), which this game lacks. Perhaps another Totem would fit nicely here as well.</p>\n<p>Sniffer : :</p>\n<p>At least one more plant. A sapling could be a rather interesting addition</p>\n<p>More hearts on the sniffer. It's massive, yet the slightest thing kills it.</p>\n<p>Over all I really enjoyed the Sniffer and I believe dino mobs are untapped potential. Imagine you could obtain them in all different ways, perhaps a fish dino is frozen in the ice spikes and you have to take it back in the block and thaw it out, or maybe a small raptor-like mob that you find stuck in underground amber.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The amount of time investment to get the mob can be upwards of multiple hours and you receive 2 plants, there is a lot of potential for unique plants that the sniffer can dig up both edible and decorative and it is a missed opportunity (and feels unrewarding) to only get 2.</p>\n<p>Second the cherry blossom biome, it is so close to perfection however the fact that there is no unique village for the biome feels like it is just out of place and undermines how the village and pillage update set up the feeling of the world.</p>\n<p>Finally pots, this is a pretty simple one, firstly the lack of being able to colour the images, if we could ad die with a sherd to colour the picture (not the whole pot the picture) it would bring a lot more life to them, if the pot could also receive an inventory, they feel very stale (even though meant for decoration) having them as a storage option would give the player so many more options for thematic building (to fit with the storytelling theme of the update)</p>",

I feel like Mojang would benefit from talking to advance mod creators (like the creator of the Create mod, or furnicraft) to learn how to implement these popular ideas.

They look bare and I feel like redesigning them with special elements would help!

This update is another Huge problem for servers that ran prior to the update. This is because finding a newly generated structures from 1.20 can be incredibly difficult. The smithing table makes it so that new players may have to travel tens of thousands of blocks for a unloaded bastion, which can be tricky.

Being able to ride it with a friend is a good idea, but useless. Almost no one uses horses because people love elytras, so even more so no one will use a ground vehicle that can lie on the ground in the middle of combat + cannot wear armor or be at least something useful .<br>2.The sniffer is even more useless than the camel. No drop, hard to get, no character. For example in order for the turtles to hatch player must breed 2 turtles one of which will have a bally and a digging animation, after which the eggs will become vulnerable to monster attacks and, most importantly, eggs can only hatch on the sand, which makes it possible to use this in lots of decorations ideas. What about a sniffer? We get an egg, put it on a block of moss and after 10 minutes a mob appears. I personally don't have any attachment to such a creature for a variety of reasons, one of which is that the player doesn't feel involved. When I raised little turtles, I protected them and managed to fall in love with them, but the sniffer does not cause me emotions. Why can an egg hatch on any blocks? There are no interesting hatching mechanics, because the sniffer will hatch no matter what, which also deprives players of using the egg as a decoration. Well, the ability of the mob itself is bad. Two&nbsp; flowers that do nothing but just stand is boring.</p>",

Blocks A+, Biome B+<br><br>Bamboo - love unique new wood designs - A+<br><br>Armor Trims - Awesome, but lacking a couple of options (prismarine crystals, crying obsidian maybe) and I think more trims should be added with new updates. A village trim, wandering trader trims.&nbsp;<br>Also think the diamond cost is a lot for cosmetics (but agree with it for Netherite upgrades).

We all know theres a power gap with Elytra, but I had a blast riding a couple of camels home to my barn. A<br><br>Archaeology - Fun, but incomplete. Great concept for a system but needs more reward than just pots and sniffer eggs (scrolls with ancient maps? ancient weapons? unique enchantment books?), C+<br><br>Trail Ruins - a bit too big, got almost everything unique clearing out just one. This should follow Archaeology recommendations, C<br><br>Sniffer - Great design and concept, underwhelming that the plants have little utility and there's only two. Hopefully gets iterated on. B-<br><br>Chiseled bookshelves - great, simple addition, appreciate the redstone too. A<br><br>Overall, 7.5/10 - lots of great stuff, some incomplete.&nbsp;<br><br><br></p>",

To <strong>excavate </strong>&amp; <strong>discover </strong>the remnants of non-human life fossils.

I was super excited about the new update as I figured it would make exploring your world more exciting than I had already found it. I think as an update there were a lot of super cool ideas that just weren’t done well. The addition of armor trim was a super cool idea but I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks they all look relatively the same. The new decorative blocks are really cool but you really missed out on the big pots being either a new storage block or a new flower pot. It’s kinda dumb in my opinion that you do all that work to acquire the sherds only to look at them, especially from a survival players point of view. The sniffer seems like a cool mob but the flowers do jack for you so it’s again something that requires a lot of work with no real gain. And the new biome is super cool but you didn’t add a new type of village showcasing either of the new wood types so again that was a missed opportunity in my opinion. I’m also a little sad from a builder point of view that cherry leaves are literally the only other colored leaf block in the entire game. We need more from you guys. \n<br />Something I think would be cool in a future update would be blocks that create more movement to your builds. I think it’d be a great way to appease the builder community and the red stone community by bringing something dynamic to the game. </p>",

Make them larger and put them under the surface. Also with the sniffer if you guys can read this SNIFFER NEEDS MORE PLANTS just 2 is not enough, can the sniffer dig up another special crop that gives resistance but takes a while to grow, a new vine that grows upwards on blocks and grows flowers and fruit, when brewd it gives a new effect: sticky feet which is negative jump boost, just any way you slice it we need more stuff, maybe different pot shapes for the decorative pots, the armor trims are the only thing that doesn’t need work, and the archeology needs better brushes enchantable with efficiency, fortune (drops more items), and luck of the sea (this would increase rates of good Items dropping from sus sand and gravel) not to mention unbreaking and mending, and maybe add like, archeologist villager who gets his job from a decorated pot, you can trade with him for pottery shards and sniffer eggs, he will also trade for a map to upgraded trail ruins, just please mojang listen to the community\n<br />We need more from the sniffer and trail ruins</p>",

Maybe try making a boss in the end city, jungle temple, and even in the portal in the ancient city. There are many different players that have different play styles in Minecraft and the only ones that this update affected was the builders, with more new blocks. But not the adventurers, risk takers, and just people looking for more action, which consists of a larger percentage of players. We need something and I’m honestly tired of these incomplete updates and mob votes that get us nowhere because it just forever throws out the other good mob ideas. All the updates are just stuffing more into the line of progression, but maybe expand it, like seriously consider making the ancient city portal actually work and have a new realm with stronger mobs and new armor to discover. And maybe don’t make the armor so OP, just have it with its own unique capabilities. But the more you put in the line of progression the more the player is given these little side quests that don’t do anything or have any value besides slowing the player down from completing the game. </p>",

Most of the fan base DOES NOT approve and making survival players take more time to get good tools, weapons, and armor takes away from some of the most amazing aspects of the game. I hate going to the nether without decent enchantments on tools. With this update, I'll to have spend quadruple the time getting geared up (which already takes enough as it is) and it'll take so much more time getting to the end, taking on the wither, getting farm's going, etc. All in all, this update is going to upset the majority of the minecraft fanbase. Let's not forget, the anvil \"Too Expensive\" cap is utterly ludicrous. For a sandbox game, there is a large list of barriers/limitations on things and this update will make that list substantially bigger.</p>",

This \"Improvement\" really makes me not want to update the game going forward and stay on 1.20.1 for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>For reference, for someone to take advantage of the current process to get the trades they want. they have to first find a village, put the villager somewhere where they wont likely be killed, trade (dealing with trade cooldowns mind you) hoping that once they are leveled up they have the trade you want. On top of that if they want to zombify them and then heal them it requires you to find an apple, gather enough gold for a golden apple, go to the nether for blaze powder, get gun powder, spider eye, sugar, a brewing stand, mushroom, glass. Its not a slow process, and is not as \"early to mid game\" as everyone is making it out to be. Why does this need to be nerfed?</p>",

I slightly agree with it. </p>\n\n<p>Here’s what you can do to make it feel more complete: possibly add a function to the pots, or make them place for good storage. \n<br />Add a new structure to the cherry biome, like possibly a cute cottage or ruins of a cottage that you can rebuild. Add a special type of mob that is specific to that biome, such as pink cows or something, I think that’d be really cute. Instead of milk, they have some kind of pink milk/liquid. I think the moo bloom was a great idea. </p>\n\n<p>The sign edits are amazing. It helped with a lot of things, definitely. </p>\n\n<p>If you could add a function to the plants, like possibly a new dye color, or a double dye color, so instead of just one color on a dye, it’s two colors, and you can dye your bed a cute pattern. </p>\n\n<p>With armor trims, I think they’re sweet, but again making them useful is what I think most players want. Maybe trims giving you more power on certain enchantments, or something? </p>\n\n<p>Generally, you guys work hard. You definitely deserve a breather. \n<br />It’s even harder to be creative and productive if you’re completely overwhelmed.

        "body": "<p>Great update, I have played it for ages, but I think that the update is very incomplete and disappointing. I know that Mojang is focusing more on things for builders, like with the new wood types and pots. All the new mobs that have been recently added in the past few updates are passive and drop nothing. There should be more exciting things out there, like there could be ancient gems and ingots which can only be found through archaeology and used to craft ancient tools and armour. Armour trims should come with small buffs like extra defence or attack strength. A new structure in the cherry grove with unique artefacts and loot. There should be more hostile mobs, dungeons and bosses to conquer for exciting loot. But instead Mojang studios focus on useless decorative things, They can't force people to be builders. They are focusing too hard on making players be creative instead of what the community actually wants, like furniture, vertical slabs, more dimensions and more. They never listen to most of the great feedback that would be great in the game. The game is starting to become more boring, the next feature for 1.21 hasn't even been revealed since minecraft live! Come on Mojang! Make minecraft amazing for every type of player, not just builders! Also one last thing, The sniffer is rubbish, the rascal should have 100% won the mob vote.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

The editable signs really help, I can kind of use them as a \"whiteboard\" for notes and not destroy and remake one everytime i need to leave a note for myself. The cherry grove biome gives me unbelievable amounts of happiness whenever I see one. The trees are so pretty, the petals and leaves are gorgeous, the wood is gorgeous and I have a habit of making cute cottages there. Sniffers are the cutest little bubs, even though i havent enccountered one. Playable mob sounds are fun. I've made a song out of skeleton sounds. Bookshelves are cute, I haven't gotten to using them though, I'm too used to the old version lol. I gotta start using them. Thank you, mojang &lt;3</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Basically, there are flaws, yes, but y'all worked so hard and I really appreciate everything you've done for us, for yourselves, for the game. You've worked hard and it ended in great results. You guys need a lot more love and positivity. Without it you might get burnt out from extensive negative feedback. Idk, I'm just assuming, but either way, love you Mojang. Thanks for all that you do. &lt;3</p>",

It would be another huge head similar to the Ender Dragon and when powered by Redstone, its antenna would wave like the Piglin's ears.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional Functionality: In spectator mode, you can look at the world through the eyes of an Enderman, Spider, and Creeper, and your screen is given a special filter.

With that though, I think there should be some alternate ways to obtain the heads. Maybe a weapon enchantment that gives you a low chance to obtain heads in the way wither skulls are obtained. Maybe this could be an electric based enchantment? It doesn't have to summon lightning or anything, but having the lightning in it would mostly be cosmetic but also give you that small chance of obtaining the heads. My reasoning behind this is because charged creepers are only found when struck by lightning, and those are needed to currently obtain any heads. Also I'm not sure how this will work in bedrock, but in java there are player heads. So maybe there can be some kind special way to get these in survival. But yeah TLDR; a way to obtain every mob head in the game, maybe with a new mechanic that makes it easier to get them from tricky mobs like ghasts and stuff, and maybe player heads in survival.

If you show both, then the trim would add its color changes on top of the existing cape colors. On some capes, some trims might look great. Other combinations might look terrible. You'd have to experiment to find out what looks good.&nbsp;<br><br>If they made unique Elytra trims, they could easily make ones that would look good with most cape designs. For example, what about a trim that worked by shrinking down the entire cape pattern a little, and then adding a strip of color around the entire outside edge? So you'd still see the entire cape pattern, just with an added border. Or you could shrink the cape design just horizontally or just vertically, and add strips of color on just the side or just the top and/or bottom edges. Or you could have one that picks the color that's used second-most in the cape (so not the cape's main, or background, color, and not a color used only for minor details, but the second most common color on the cape) and changes that color to the selected trim color.

So with the walls on the kingdom, perhaps there is somewhat of a wall, but its broken, shattered, unfinished around the kingdom and you have to craft the stones or whatever material it is, to fix it before pillagers and such attack.</p>\n<p>Perhaps also have the appropriate sized pillager base nearby as well. So if its a village town, there's a pillage town base nearby at the same size. If there's a kingdom nearby then there's a huge pillager base nearby with more pillagers and so on.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>also, kingdoms should be somewhat rare. I'd say have them generate a little bit more than mansions do, but not too much. Making them not so rare as mansions that you hardly ever find them, but rare enough that it's super rewarding and exciting when you do find them.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>I have this idea for sign icons. I was thinking about a new item maybe a stamp or a chisel. Something that can let you carve or print icons onto a blank sign. When you right click this item onto an unwaxed blank sign, you can choose from a selection of iconography to print a large icon boldly onto the center. It takes up about two to three lines. The UI is similar to the loom. One of the many reasons this can be useful is of course decorating. Imaging this. When you're walking down the streets of a minecraft build, you can see different shops. A hanging signs informs you of what shop it is. An anvil symbol may indicate a smithery. A grass block may indicate building supply. A sword may indicate weaponry.</p>\n<p>Here's a list of icons I have in mind. Creeper, skull and crossbones, no entry, X, ✓, directional arrows, sword, pickaxe, anvil, grass block, ingot, mojang symbol, apple, mob egg, emerald, heart, iron golem, fire, redstone torch, wheat, pig, horse armor, globe, flower, warden, sound waves, bottle, dragon egg, eye of ender, guardian, bell, boat, zzZ (3 Zs diagonally), chestplate, cookie, firework rocket, elytra, music note, chest, rails, map, TNT, saddle, fishing rod, crafting grid, and flint and steel.</p>\n<p>Ther other reason to add this is legibility. In traffic law, traffic signs need to have a certain font to be legible in passing. For similar circumstances, having bolder and thicker arrows may be more preferable than the simple ---&gt;. Plus its more naturally integrated.</p>",

However, this does not happen when you say “garden hoe(s)” instead. But you run out of space. If possible, could we fix this? </p>\n\n<p>Also, when writing a sign, you must go to the following line to save your work. So, for example, if I write “Garden Hoes and Shovels” on line one, I must proceed to line two to keep my work before exiting. Perhaps, we’ll be able to fix this? Thank you!</p>",

Wow it gives you glowing ink that is used on item frames and signs but they don't actually glow lol (also they're kinda ugly imo) and I LOVE the moobloom. I don't think it was rigged, though. It's their fault it won, but that's not really what rigged is LOL -- they really should bring back the moobloom, though. And honestly, I think it should've won, partlu cause I love it, but mostly cause I see it everywhere even before the glow squid was added? But it didn't win? Its beyond me lol... Ig my point is that I agree that they should bring the moobloom (as well as past mob vote mobs) back into new votes (since they said they would,) but idk of I'd call it rigged.</p>",
