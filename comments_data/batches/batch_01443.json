They're tall Obsidian towers that are guarded by Ender Mantas on the outside so you couldn't stack blocks up to the top where the treasure is without Ender Mantas knocking you off, you'd be forced to enter the Obelisk's Maze and Monsters. And at the top is where you get your first Elytra (instead of at the End Cities). So then you could fly from the top to the bottom and the Elytra is a real challenge to aquire </p>",

It would also make the strongholds a more interesting experience, there's no challenge, or even any replay ability outside of trying to find the end portal. Lastly, it would tie into the lore of Minecraft really well, we have ruined nether portals with nether blocks slowly creeping into the overworld, and the deep dark strongly resembles the end theme, with lots of lavenders and blue-blacks, so maybe the deep dark is the result of a ruined end portal</p>",

The point was not to do a simple mob that attacks the player or gives new items and stuff but actually to change the mechanics of how the player had to mine, because basically, when you play the game, you get to a point where some basic activities like mining or just randomly exploring become quite easy because you have the best armour. So, instead of being a direct threat to the player and attack with brute force, messing up with his habits and forcing him to put himself in danger despite the armour or weapon he has can be another way of being a threat. That's what i wanted, a mob that changes the way the player acts in his surroundings.</p>\n<p>Anyway thanks a lot for your comment and i hope you like my idea!</p>",
