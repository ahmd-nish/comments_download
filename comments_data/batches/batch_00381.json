        "body": "<p>I beg to differ with your point of view.<br><br>I don't think it will become as powerful as you may think in early game as it can only hold one stack of items. This is just a balanced way for us to group together two types of items that could logically fit in one slot&nbsp; together.16 stack items will count as 4 instead of 1 items, Unstackables won't be able to be stored. What you propose takes away the only feature bundles have, making them useless.<br><br>The crafting recipe for the bundle is unknown, we don't really know if this is an item that can be accessed in early or mid game as its crafting cost and its position in the tec-tree is unknown, it could also be uncrafteable and actually be a rare mob drop or chest loot.&nbsp;<br><br>And to finish, a bundle and a shulker box are way more different than what you may expect them to be at first glance. Here's some differences:<br><br>-Shulkers have 27 \"shareless\" inventory slots, Bundles have only one shareable slot.<br>-Shulker are an endgame item, they can't be accessed in the main gameplay experience. Bundles, judging by their features &amp; appearance, are obtainable during the main gameplay experience.<br>-With shulkers you decide what items to save inside and which to take from inside. Bundles unfill completely.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I don’t think it I’ll be overpowered at all since it seems it still limits the item count to the item type stack limit (usually 64). This almost makes it underpowered in my opinion. I would love to see an implementation where you do not have to take items out of bundles sequentially because if you can’t “open” the bundle into your inventory without free space, it makes bundles quite hard to use in practice. It also seems important that there is a way to drain the items out of bundles somehow like we can do from shulker using hoppers.</p>",
