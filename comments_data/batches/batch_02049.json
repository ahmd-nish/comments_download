Unlike iron golems, guard is a TRADE that any villager can take up if the position is open and someone is unemployed\" a trade and position are two very different things, so which one is it? Do you trade to get them or do they take a position somehow? I don't really get the idea for that not trying to be rude . </p>\n\n<p>Also with \", they do not attempt to fight pillagers unless they attack another villager\" that doesn't matter if the mobs attack first mojang still made it clear that they won't make villagers fight in any shape or form. I like the idea of them fighting but since that's not gonna happen we should improve golems or add a COMPLETELY new human type mob to guard a village . </p>",

Additions such as the Drowned have also wreaked havoc on villages that spawn near water and have devastated entire villager populations since they are there day and night.&nbsp; I have some games where unless I go into creative/peaceful mode, villagers are extinct. Sometimes they are already extinct before I find them in a new game.</p>\n<p>This is a problem, as it is incredibly hard to find and rehabilitate villagers that have turned into zombies.&nbsp; Even if you CAN find one and rehabilitate them, you need to actually have at least 2 and keep them alive long enough to get them back to a village and make them want to breed.&nbsp; In many cases getting villagers to become willing to breed requires a LOT of remodeling and planting.&nbsp; All this, along with protecting them from both themselves and their surroundings, is a lot of work and hours upon hours of gameplay.</p>\n<p>It should not take up such a huge chunk of my playtime just to have a functioning village!</p>",

If a villager doesn't have a bed it will head for the nearest unassigned bed. Note - a bed that is a respawn point is assigned to the player. This also should prevent the cluster bug where all the villagers try to cram into one house in the center of the village.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">It does break the stupid iron golem farms, but the makers of those can come up with new designs.</p>\n</div>",
