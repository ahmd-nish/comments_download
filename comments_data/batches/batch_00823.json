(Three enchantment levels) We already have something similar in the form of shulker boxes, but they are an endgame item, so having some more storage in the early game would allow all players to benefit greatly.</p>\n<p>The problem I have with 'stack' is that unless the items being stacked (say swords) are all enchanted the same way, they won't stack properly. You see this in custom servers all the time where two of seeming the same item won't stack because one of them has an NBT tag, and the other doesn't. Honestly; I don't think this one would work.</p>\n<p>Technically, we can \"kidnap\" animals right now with the Lead; but it would be nice to find a way for them not to escape as often. But these bundles are small, made out of rabbit skin. I doooooon't think you're picking up a cow or a pig with one.</p>\n<p>Bundle specific curses would be neat, perhaps give the bundle a different effect with the \"Curse of Binding\" eh? Instead of being stuck to you, it binds/constricts the bundle, so you have to open it with the Strength effect or with Shears as mentioned above.</p>",

But i have one reason that should be possible: Magic. Lol. And the least enchantment: yes, very great idea! that would give another reason for curse of binding to exist, and it also makes sence, having the name curse of binding</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To the second answer: Yes bundle is a great item, and a very good idea, but, in my opinion, it would just add more coolness to the bundle. And maybe it is a little op, but actually, you need a enhantment table, to get it, and they cost a lot. Or maybe you could find enchantment books, in the chest of warden, so that makes them more difficoult to get.</p>\n<p>:D</p>",

I was thinking of having&nbsp;the world extend to Y = -128 with the addition of the 'Deeper Dark' below -64 which would have this concept but at the very least it would be nice to see the feature as you suggested. It could be akin to bedrock fog and as mentioned get progressively darker. This would actually encourage a player to make a rather underutilized potion... Night Vision. To not break the challenge perhaps night vision could sort of negating the effects of each level so when you get to the lowest y it's as if you were at y = 0 when you have night vision active.</p>",
