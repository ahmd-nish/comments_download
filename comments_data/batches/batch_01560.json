        "body": "<p>I own axolotls and breed them. You CANNOT put axolotls near tropical fish, cod, salmon, or puffers. all 4 are too large and would either eat the axolotl directly, or nibble at its gills causing it to suffocate. Especially not tropical fish. Axolotls are freshwater and like it around 50 degrees F, with moderate ph, and little light. I also owned discus, which closely resemble the tropical fish in minecraft despite being freshwater, and my grandfather owns angel fish and trigger fish which also resemble the minecraft fish. Discus need very acidic low ph (not sure about the angels and triggers on this one), both need high temperatures (discus like it around 80F), and the angels and triggers like lots of light and are obviously saltwater fish. Axolotls would die in these conditions if they stayed for too long, or try to morph like on land but die from stress as they are losing their morph genes. Baby axolotls can only eat very small creatures, and sadly the only ones readily available on the market are baby brine shrimp, as you can buy hatcheries. Baby axolotls love them however as they are small crustaceans. I feed my adult axolotls blood worms, black worms, and sometimes an earthworm as a nice treat. They love worms, small arthropods, mollusks, and small crustaceans as this post includes. Small fish can still be risky due to the gill thing. If you don't want to add another mob, I feed my axolotls salmon pellets so adding a new craftable food item might work but would be weird.</p>",
