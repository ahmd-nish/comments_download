Likewise, it could have limited lashing distance and pulling speeds, but these could be upgraded with enchantments. Good Idea.</p>",

The structure could spawn in one of the ice biomes and give us something except igloos and villages to find out there. Maybe ice spikes biome. Also, the frozen thing would either have to be a temporary paralysis or just be a slowness effect with some cool screen effects of some sort. Permanent freezing would be no fun. Maybe slowness, but if it kills a entity (not a player because players respawn and it would be weird to see your own frozen body. Same reason as no player heads survival) then you get the frozen entity as an item, which you could use for decoration (maybe use like a armor stand that you cant change the position of). The end does need a update though...</p>",
