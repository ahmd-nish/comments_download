The switch to 3x3 crafting was to make it useful for storage, facilitating more long term uses for Copper in the future. That change didn't decrease the amount of Copper blocks you could make, because along with the recipe change they made the ores drop 2-3 Raw Copper, or 2.5 on average. After this change with Fortune III, Copper Ore can now yield 8.8 Raw Copper on average, or about one block. If you do the maths, the changes made to the crafting recipe were more than balanced out by the change in the yields of the ore. The snapshot as a whole made Copper yields more plentiful on average with Fortune. Though I get your point, Ore Veins will balance everything out when 1.18 comes out. Now is not the best time for building with Copper and we have to live with it, because changing the recipe after a full release is illogical. It means if you've built with Copper and you want to convert it to ingots, you'll have less ingots. It would be disastrous to a lot of people.</p>",

They tuned down the orangey colors in Pre-release 3. In the context of builds it is just a subtle difference that you would only notice if you look more closely, and it looks realistic and has such a cool effect to it that fits with the Candles and can be useful in builds. Candles are really small, so having them change texture when lit is just a small detail that makes them feel more immersive. You can keep them unlit if that's your thing; not like they're the most efficient light source.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Moss doesn't need to follow the biome foliage rule. I'd even argue it shouldn't. Then it's no different from Optifine grass. Not all plants need to have biome foliage. What they're clearly going for with the Lush Caves is that they want to make them unique, and part of that is by having all of the plants there be that fixed lively color regardless of biome. I'd personally like that. It gives us the option of having certain plants that you could use in the same style no matter where your builds are, and perhaps making interesting patterns with them by mixing them in with the foliaged plants. I am sure some people would love having an option for plants that don't change color wherever you are, and this is a great opportunity to do so considering how unique Lush Caves are compared to any forested biome in Minecraft. It just fits the effect of an underground lush biome in my opinion.</p>",
