It's OK to hide the leash, or only show as a ghost/transparant leash when the player is very close by. Only 1 additional item needed in game, and without it, the behavior as it is currently will stay.<br><br>Another way to link would be similar to the name tagging or compass-to-lodestone linking. When building a workstation, it has 1 tag in its inventory that can be used to assign a villager, which will then be force-linked until the station is broken. The station produces only 1 tag when placed. If you need another tag, the previous tag becomes invalid and when placed again a new tag is created.<br><br>Both ways solve the enormous tediousness with linking, without changing the default behavior for the folk that don't want to meddle with it.</p>",

Having each account you want to use for online play have a online subscription attached to it? This approach does not really work on Switch since a Switch is mostly tied to just one individual and thus has mostly just one account per Switch (in the case of my family at least), as opposed by a home console which probably has all those accounts centralised on one console and thus allows for easy combined local/online play.</p>\n\n<p>It's a damn shame how many times Minecraft has disappointed me, because it seems so much fun but there's these little bugs and things that keep that fun at a distance.</p>",

        "body": "<p>While the feature works nicely in Terraria, I'm not sure it would transfer well in survival Minecraft. In Terraria, items don't despawn or burn in lava, so the trash can is really the only way to dispose of stuff. Terraria also has a safety feature where you can favorite items to keep them locked into your inventory. Terraria items are also organized into tiers, with the gray tier being objectively worthless.</p>\n<p>Minecraft, for starters, doesn't have the tier system. No item is truly worthless. Even rotten flesh can be traded with villagers. Of course, sometimes you still want to get rid of items. This much is true. But it would give the added risk, as MacchuPicchu notes, of accidentally throwing out valuable items. (In creative mode, of course, you could just bring it right back, so it makes more sense to have it there.) And unlike Terraria, we can just throw stuff at a cactus.</p>\n<p>This doesn't mean that your idea is just total garbage (pun intended), but I think it definitely needs some tweaking. I do agree that when I'm mining, sometimes I don't want to be picking up every single item on the ground just to toss it down and pick it up again. So either an additional \"safety\" feature like Terraria has, that doesn't let you throw certain items out, or else maybe it doesn't really delete the item, but rather, throws it on the ground and doesn't let you pick it up again for a certain amount of time. Stuff despawns after five minutes, I believe, so anything that you \"delete\" could be thrown on the ground and marked that you can't pick it up for, say, three minutes. Still kind of a mess, so maybe it turns invisible too? But it would be a built-in safety feature to keep your diamonds safe.</p>",

I would absolutely love if they added a button for each action. Such as having a button for hitting, or placing blocks, or throwing snowballs or ender pearls. Basically they should make like a buttong for a right and left mouse click kinda thing on mobile. And should also allow to have two of the same buttons for hitting and placing so u can use both thumbs at the same time (left and right click). Plzzz mojang read this I'm getting frustrated and know a lot of people who r too!</p>",
