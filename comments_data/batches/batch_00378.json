Perhaps instead of choosing how long a note plays for, maybe the length will depend on how long a redstone signal stays on the note.

For example, one amplifier would amplify the sound by two times and then another on top would amplify the sound by two again and increase the radius it is heard by 10 blocks. Perhaps a limit of 12 could be applied (the same amount of blocks a piston can push) so as to not cause griefing by sound.</p>\n\n<p>I firmly believe note blocks need an update and I do hope this post receives more attention. </p>",

If you'd like to receive training you'll need to give the wizard a a mushroom. Wizard training would most likely just be brewing potions, gathering materials, and learning spells. At the end of wizard training you'd make your own wand (somehow) out of something only a wizard would have. Completing your training will give the advancement&nbsp;<strong>Magic Man.&nbsp;</strong>Wizards use the purification spell to turn dark wizards back into regular mobs, they can also use the spell on the player.</p>\n<p>Dark wizards are a powerful version of the evokers who attack you on sight. To receive dark wizard training you'd need to give them an end crystal. This training is just learning spells on your own and your given a stick to preform spells, you learn dark magic from a dark wizard and at the end the dark wizard will use the corruption spell to turn you into a dark wizard, which will give you the advancement&nbsp;<strong>Master of the dark arts.&nbsp;</strong>The player can use the corruption spell on other mobs to turn them into an army of dark wizards which may or may not betray you. Dark magic uses souls instead of exp, the player can use these souls to cast spells and if they don't have enough souls for a spell they are effected with a debuff for 10 seconds. In order to gain more souls is by killing.</p>",
