They're a bit niche, but they're the Australian Little Penguin, which is the smallest type of penguin, and also the cutest.

        "body": "<p>Boss fight? After building a structure reminiscent of the wither or iron golem with bone blocks (“fossils”) and then a skull from a different dimension like the end. Only able to spawn in the desert of course, drops a fairly op but very useful item, wither drops wither star for a beacon so something relating to that perhaps? Maybe increase beacon range or making an upgrade to the elytra which allows for the elytra chestplate, which would be very cool and concurrent with game logic if the wither spawns from wither skeleton skulls perhaps the death worm can spawn from floating miniature leviathan creatures in the end dimension, like the ones seen in Avengers Assemble, maybe you get their teeth to attach to end stone in a 3x3 grid on the end of the fossil to spawn it and they have like a 0.5% chance of dropping from the little leviathans. It’d tie in quite nicely as things seem to float in the end, elytra, shulker projectiles, new leviathan. And with the leviathan being fairly armoured it would tie the elytra to additional armour? Could be further balanced out with a special configuration for making a crafting station to combine the elytra and netherite chestplate, maybe netherite crafting bench made from 4 blocks of netherite or something end related</p>",

In most Creepers are sometimes too easy to spot from afar, which sorta goes against the name sake, of being some sort of ambusher.</p>",
