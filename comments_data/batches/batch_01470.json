Slime chunks are way waaaayy too frequent, i started building a city underground where i will drag and facilitate a cured zombie villager, eventually creating an underground civilization. Unfortunately, after doing tons of work, i will have to give up. Why? Due to slimes, slime chunks are way too frequent and there isn't an actual way to stop them from spawning in, that means, if i finish my city, there are likely to end up being way more slimes than villagers, slimes that constantly attack me and make the city inhospitable.</p>\n<p>Not to mention the fact that any factories would be useless since i'd have slimes constantly disrupting them. Having slimes only in swamps (increase the amount that spawn each night to compensate) would let us actually use our worlds underground. As it stands now, anything you build underground is bound to intersect a slime chunk and cause constant and infinite spawns. The only solution to this, in my case would be to cover the ground of the entire city in slabs or glass blocks. Meaning no tress can grow, no grass can be present, which again means i can't use any blocks other than slabs and glass. Until this change is made, the underground world of Minecraft is virtually useless.</p>",
