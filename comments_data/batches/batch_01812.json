And if I run the same superflat customization with \"Generate Structures:OFF\" there is no stronghold.<br><br><strong>Please, please, please </strong>allow for more natural customization of structure generation.

I would like to shed some light on the inspiration of this project.</p>\n<p>What inspired me to make this project was a movie that I can't imagine too many other people in the world watch or have watched. The movie was called Waterworld. If this movie doesn't ring any bells for you, you should watch it and you'll understand what I say beyond this point.</p>\n<p>In the beginning of the movie, the narrator explains that in this future of Earth, the polar ice caps have melted, covering the globe in water. The remains of human civilization are living on these floating shaft-like structures called \"Atolls\". They're kind of a circular village that hovers above the water. They're made of wood. This is where I got the inspiration from.</p>",
