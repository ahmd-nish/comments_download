As you mentioned, it significantly helps server owners who don't have the capabilities to handle a full moderation team.</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm VERY concerned about the lack of communication on opting-out, and just generally what that process looks like. I'm okay with it being on-by-default, server operators (such as myself) know how to adjust server.properties. However, there's been no clear communication from you about if we'll have the option to turn it off both when 1.19.1 releases and in the long-term future.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, I think the warning for unsigned messages should be disable-able on the client side. Make it an option that those who's Microsoft accounts are under parental controls can't change (or something similar to that) and I think you'll find a great middle ground between those who don't want to deal with global chat moderation and those who want to be protected by it.</p>",

There are concerns with some servers having bad moderators, but that is most likely a server unlike Hypixel. A system could instead be implemented in which parents could be notified if their child joined a less known server, and then the parents can take the decision into their own hands on whether their child should play on that server or not. If people are worried about someone abusing someone else in a server, I think that most people would be against it and would provide help and support to the abused person while calling out the abuser and talking to server admins to remove the abuser. If the admins don't, well people won't play on that server anymore, because of the people who run it. Personally, I think Microsoft is just trying to get control over Minecraft players, which I am certain will not do them well and can only begin the downfall of Minecraft. Thank you.</p>",

I see why Mojang is implementing this, but banning players from ALL ONLINE SERVERS for just one bad comment is wrong. First of all, third party servers are not owned by Microsoft, and therefore should not be subject to their bans. Second, people create servers that are for adults only, so they have different policies than Microsoft's. Third, banning people from playing online and in single player (even though they paid for the account) quite possibly violates many consumer rights laws, leaving this update to the possibility of legal action. Finally, servers have been handling chat moderation since they were first created, with little to no problems occurring. Along with different server policies and punishments, if several people decided to report me (resulting in my ban from online play),I would no longer be able to operate and play on the server THAT I OWN. Overall, throughout my many years of playing, I have loved many of Minecraft's updates, but this one upsets me and many others.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your time and attention,</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-LegoMasterV</p>",

Why are you trying to enforce this more than a decade later when it initially launched?</p>\n<p>The past decade alot of (third party) servers have arisen, which all have their own way of moderating the game. Those (sub-)communities all have a variety of age, meaning no server fits all.<br>Now here's the biggest issue: this system only focusses on just one group, being smaller children, while leaving out the rest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A better way to do this, is allowing an <strong>optional</strong> parenting feature that only allows smaller children to join Mojang affiliated services, such as realms. That way they won't be exposed to third party servers. This way the power stays for third party services in the community who to welcome on their server or not (using their own ban system as they already do), and allows Mojang to protect who desire it.<br><br>Remember: no-one is forced to stay on a server and can leave whenever they want.&nbsp;<br>Interference from Mojangs side would only undermine the control players have over their servers, which should be avoided at all cost. Not only would this gives trust issues, it also would split the community even further.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So in short: as someone who has played this game for over a decade: please listen to the community, do not continue with this (flawed) system. Leave the moderation to the community and don't take that right away from us.</p>\n<p>Thanks alot!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

So please, either remove chat report system or add a setting that can disable/enable this feature. Because of 1.19.1 chat reporting update, it's most likely that players are terrified about if they're going to be banned after saying a single chat.
