Of course, before it even begins to attack, it has to hear you, but when it does, it will move very slowly to your location, giving you plenty of time to get away. If you hit it however, it seems to enrage, and it will give off a roar. While it is roaring it stays still, giving you one last chance to get out of there. If you do not, it will run straight at you, and at this point, it is much more difficult to get away from . I'm only saying that, if you encounter a warden, it is not an instant death sentence. If you do not want to fight the warden, just get out of there before it enrages. It gives you plenty of time to react to its presence, or so it seems at this point. To be honest, we'd really need to see the warden in a snapshot first before we begin to talk about nerfing it.</p>",

The Deep Dark would only generate below Y=0 from our knowledge, and judging by the ore generation, I believe it is likely that the Deep Dark would generate exclusively and continuously below Y=-32 (or at least I hope so). If you mine that deep, you will probably have knowledge of what you're getting yourself into. It's not like you will just randomly find the Warden while mining or spelunking. Like others said, the Warden is meant to be a disaster that you stealth around, not a boss that you are encouraged to fight. If you tread carefully and use proper strategies to avoid it, it shouldn't detect you. Besides, I believe you would definitely be able to explore most of the underground without running into it, so if you don't want to stealth or take the risk, you can easily ignore the Deep Dark (along with all of the loot and features). Nerfing it would just destroy an entire gameplay feature, as would adding an item that allows to easily deal with it or avoid stealthing around it.</p>",

The use would be to craft potions of frost resistance. these could be used in addition to leather armor to resist frost on the highest peaks/cold biomes or in large quantities of powdered snow. Also, the cold status effect should be possible in all cold biomes and at high elevations to some degree. thus making potions of frost resistance important. The most hostile conditions (possibly tall snowy mountains) should require users to have both leather armor and the frost resistance potion at the same time to get rid of the frost effect compleatly. Additionally, it would be interesting if you only have one it just slows the onset of the status effect giving you more time to get out of the situation.&nbsp;</p>",
