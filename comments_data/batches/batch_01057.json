First, that would be&nbsp;<strong>dreadfully annoying</strong>. Second, developers would have to create cursed versions of&nbsp;<strong>every single existing item in the game</strong>, and that would really be annoying. I agree with adding something like the Curse of Clumsiness, but there should at least be something like a five to ten second cooldown.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You should also be able to get these curses from an Enchanting Table. One way I was thinking of this is just getting a book enchanted with it on a standard enchanting table, maybe to prank your friends with it. Another way is that maybe you might be enchanting something, such as your sword. You enchanted it with Sharpness IV, but it unfortunately came along with Curse of Binding.&nbsp;</p>",

It's ridiculous that Mojang prides Minecraft on being multiplayer friendly while in reality the only way to play multiplayer is either buy a realm for $7.99, or spend ages setting up a server (I literally tried to explain all the steps but there were too many characters) and that's the way it's been literally since 1.0 was released. All Java accounts are linked with Microsoft, which means your Xbox friends could be the ones to join your Java world. They already showed off that this could be possible with the Chat Report Feature. There are already a ton of mods which make the Open to LAN function online, and it's actually easier to install the mod than set up the server which is quite sad. If you ask the average Java player what their opinion on this is, they'd say they're perfectly happy the way it is, but the only reason they say that is because the average Java player is either a techno wizard, they play with their siblings with Open to LAN, or they just play single-player. And the less techy people aren't buying realms, they're just quitting Java altogether. If Mojang thinks that if they do this they'll miss out on realms subscriptions, they're absolutely wrong. If a player wants their own private server and doesn't know how to make one, they'll 100% buy a Realm. If Mojang decides to do this it will make their community EXTREMELY happy, and they'd also get a big surge of players coming back to the game.</p>",

Perhaps the ancient enchantments could function more like projectile preservation where they can absorb different things, but they could perhaps be augmented by the object absorbed.</p>\n<p>For example, absorbing a fire charge or flaming arrow could provide a more powerful fire aspect, and when using a grindstone you remove the augmentation from the item, allowing for a new augmentation to be applied. An aditional projectile augmentation could be ender pearls allowing you to teleport to a block within range (standard PC range, not mobile's expanded range) for easy escape during combat.</p>\n<p>Within this idea, brushes could have a unique enchantment allowing for other items to be augmented by items brushed up. The ability to augment an item could be disabled by simply sneaking, and this would allow the brush to retrive items normaly. The brush wouldn't give an augmentation for sniffer eggs, pottery shards, and other unique items found through archeology. For example, a candle could cause pickaxes to become illuminated, emmiting perhaps light level 3. TNT could cause mob death to damage other mobs, similar to how TNT and creepers only harm entities when in water and don't damage blocks.</p>",

More trees should spawn in the swamp waters so that you can boat under the roots of these trees. Tadpoles could spawn in the swamp waters to give it more life, as right now it feels empty. I like how bee nests can also spawn here!</p>\n<p>Adding ambient sound effects in the wild like rustling leaves, water drips in caves, sea winds, howling peaks, firefly buzzing and fog in swamps... they will perfect the Wild update and give more identity to biomes.</p>\n<p>Mud to clay conversion should be MUCH faster. Clay and concrete needs to be easily renewable so that survival players can actually have a better building palette. I hope that most building blocks like sand/calcite/endstone will be easily renewable to give more variety to survival builds.</p>\n<p>Recovery compass is a decent idea that fits the Warden's soul theme, though it's not useful for hardcore players. Echo Shards need to be a bit more common in the Ancient City chests. In the future, echo shards and amethyst/lapis should have more uses, perhaps a magic-themed update to craft and recharge a magic staff? Copper also needs more uses; introduce more copper building blocks like chains, bars, and copper golems, to give players a huge sink for copper.</p>",

Mangrove swamps look and feel pretty good, I am a bit concerned about how frequently propagules drop from trees. As I have a pretty good system I experience no lag issues around them but for lower end players I think many items littering the ground could impact some peoples fps in these areas. I also agree with previous users that mud may make a good addition to rivers in order to make mud feel more natural. I am very pleased with the new range for activated shriekers to successfully summon wardens as it vastly improves the gameplay within ancient cities as you can no longer just run from shriekers to avoid spawning wardens. It still disappoints me however that there is still no way to move summonable shriekers in survival for player created dungeons, traps, etc. It also would make more sense for shriekers placed in creative to be spawnable by default or at least be able to crtl+pickblock spawnables ones to make placing them in creative easier while creating custom maps or game modes involving the warden. Lastly the warden definitely requires ways to reach the players above 4 blocks, inside 1x2 or 2x2 tunnels and 1x1 holes in the ground. Perhaps it can slowly climb, crouch/crawl into smaller spaces or toss blocks for a semi ranged attack that can reach these areas. Be creative we love to see what you come up with beyond increased reach.</p>",

But exploring them could be better, specifically when it comes to boating.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For one, boating through these swamps is a pain, since you constantly get stopped by hitting lily pads. In real life I have gone kayaking in swamps before, and lily pads usually aren't an issue and I can just float over them, so a simple change to make exploration more fun would be to allow boats to simply row over lily pads rather than be stopped by them.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another problem is that a boat's hitbox is 2 blocks wide, making it almost impossible to row through any areas that are a bit dense. As a solution to this, it might be fun to introduce a wooden kayak or canoe that could fit through 1 block gaps, which would make it easier to navigate through the denser parts of the swamp. As a tradeoff, it might not be able to move as quickly as a normal boat, or maybe its hitbox is longer making it harder to turn in very narrow areas.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Finally, it feels like not enough of the mangrove trees intersect with the water. I would really enjoy being able to float through narrow root passageways, but the roots only seem to generate on the very edges of the water. A good change would be to allow trees to generate deeper into the water, or create small streams that run through the land. Or maybe just make rivers in the mangrove swamp more shallow in general, to allow trees to generate uniformly across.</span></p>",

When the terrain generates a two high spot, you've got mud on top of dirt, which looks silly.  Maybe all the dirt down to stone is just mud? And also when it transitions to the water, there's dirt under the water, which looks even worse.  Probably mud should just be under water, or transition over time like farmland getting wet. </p>\n\n<p>Second, there needs to be more water.  The few times I saw a Mangrove Swamp with a channel of water, it looked so much better than when they were almost entirely on land.  I like the water to land balance in the regular swamps, so it could be closer to that, maybe.  The water color is really nice, though.  Can fish spawn, even if it's just carp? Or tadpoles.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the grass is a good color, but the transition from mud to grass looks a little off. Maybe break it up a bit, interlace the mud and grass?  And have more of the taller grass placed about, even in the mud itself.\n<br /> \n<br />Can witch huts spawn in the mangrove swamps? If so, those ones should be made from the mangrove wood.  I think that would be neat. </p>",

This would also allow the use of boats in mangrove swamps, as right now they are too dense and you can't really get very far just using a boat.

Like other commenters said, it should be possible to boat throughout the entire biome.</li>\n<li>As of now they feel a bit lifeless; Mangrove forests are among the most life-filled biomes in real life and it would be amazing if the game biome could reflect that. Bees and frogs spawning there is great, but in addition bats could spawn and hide among the trees in the day and fly about at night. Cod and (certain types of) tropical fish should be everywhere in the water, since mangroves are known to be fish nurseries. While parrots aren't the main bird species in mangroves, they do exist there and there aren't any other birds to represent the vast amounts of bird species that live in them. Ocelots could stand in for fishing cats.</li>\n</ol>",

The new compass is neat and usefull but has some downsides as well</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Mangrove biome:</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">The mangrove biome is really good, it really feels like an acutal swamp lol, It's also nice that the old swamp isn't deleted, glad they can live togheter. What does feel weird is the mud and dirt combination when the generation is elevated in the swam. You have 1 layer of mud and then only dirt. The contrast is weird.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Oh and also the old swamp feels really outdated, maybe add mud to this swamp as well?</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Echo shards and recovery compass:</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">These guys are really really really cool!. It's nice to see more unique loot in the ancient cities! But 1 mayor downside is that it is practicly useless for hardcore players, this feels weird since it looks like you are just kinds \"ignoring\" the hardcore players. Maybe add a function that will also help hardcore players.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Also I think it is very smart to add the shards and not the compass in the ancient city loot table, since you will have more oppertunities for the future (even more items!).</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">It is getting better and better by the snapshot (loot) but I still hope there will be 1 or 2 more items, since you now have a nice base to build upon (the shards). I can imagine alot of things made with this new item.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">That was my review. And again mojang has outdone themselves, another amazing snapshot!</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">10/10</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Love it, have a nice day everyone!</p>",

The swamp currently feels very dense, and i know that is what they are like irl, but i dont think that works in MC. The density feels almost claustrophobic, like i would avoid that area until i had better gear (as if it was the end) or just deforest it for resources rather then actually explore it. Its a mixture of just feeling inaccessible and knowing that i would get stuck and killed by mob spawning. Overworld MC biomes don't typically feel like this, i dont think the biome should be thinned out by much, maybe like every 10th, 15th, or hell 30th tree. Just enough that mobility in that biome feels possible while keeping the true mangrove swamp feel. overall, the environmental science/ecology nerd in me is freaking out at how amazing this new biome is!! I am studying those things in Uni so seeing the care being put into this new biome is AMAZING!! My only critique is that it might be a little too realistic. Otherwise, it is wonderful! thank you so much for the hard work you are putting in! I adore this game so much, i've grown up with it! Been playing it since middle school i think. the fact that it is not only still around, but still beloved and worked on is wonderful! you all are doing an amazing job and i just thank you so much!!<br>TL;DR: mangrove biome feels claustrophobic, maybe thin it out a little? keep up the great work!!!</p>",

I'm just going go list things to add or change based on my experience:</p>\n<p>-Change the mud generation so that it is only mud above the stone. Currently mud going up cliffs looking strange and jarring. It would be better if it was all mud and no dirt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Less grass and more mud. Currently it feels like a biome of grass with patches of mud. It should be a biome of mud with little to no grass.</p>\n<p>-More water. It seems like there is too much land and not enough water.</p>\n<p>-Mud in water. Mud should be able to generate underwater.</p>\n<p>-Cattails. When I think of a swamp, I think cattails. Cattails are a staple of swamps and the pale orange would bring a nice contrast to the dull browns and would bring unique vegetation to the biome.</p>\n<p>-Moss in the water. I mean we already have moss. I don't think I've ever seen a swamp without moss. Why would you blow this opportunity?</p>\n<p>-Swamp villages. Swamp villager skins already in the game. This is literally the perfect opportunity to put them in their place. Not trying to be bold, but if they aren't added now they may as well be deleted from the game.&nbsp;</p>",

A lot of traversal in the biome seems to be on land. There are some areas with water though, and they look much better.</li>\n<li>Dirt shouldn't spawn under mud, only under the grass. It should be mud all the way down to stone as that would look much nicer. Contrary to most, I really like the mud texture, but I think that the mud and dirt textures next to/near each other looks pretty bad, they are very different styled textures and look out of place next to each other.</li>\n<li>Is it intentional that the muddy mangrove roots can be orientated like a log block but the regular mangrove roots cannot?
