That way, you can only use it in short stretches, or in carefully made tunnels that don't allow any light, which have their own hazards. That way it is much harder to fly long distances, and still not as good as elytra. In response to the idea of killing them for their wings, it might be too farmable, but what if when they run out of durability, they actually break, unlike elytra? You can't repair them, because they would be too powerful that way. But those are my thoughts!</p>",
