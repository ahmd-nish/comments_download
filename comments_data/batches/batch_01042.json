You could say the ability to click fast from Java Edition 1.8.9 was a technique, but they were able to remove that. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that what I meant was for them to remove the ability to place blocks in front of you. There is a Java mod (Lambda controls) that adds front block placing to Java Edition, so Mojang could just as easily make it impossible on keyboard and controller in Bedrock. It just has to detect what input method you are using, which should be easy since the game can already detect inputs from different control styles, so recognizing them and removing this should work since bridging methods are client side, not server side.</p>",
