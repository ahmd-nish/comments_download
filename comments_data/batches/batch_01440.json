        "body": "<p>contrary to what the person above me has said, I'd argue Shulkers are close enough to fitting the requirements. Some minor research led me to find that all Arthropods have the following features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No Spinal Column</li>\n<li>An Exoskeleton</li>\n<li>Bi-Lateral Symmetry</li>\n<li>Jointed Appendages</li>\n<li>Segmented Bodies</li>\n<li>Specialised Appendages</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shulkers <strong>do not possess a Spine</strong>, I would argue their shell can count as an <strong>Exoskeleton</strong>, they absolutely have Bilateral Symmetry, I would say their disconnected shells and head count for <strong>Segmented Bodies</strong>, and- the <strong>Specialised Appendages</strong> point is hard to argue for, but you could argue say their top shell that functions to hide and reveal themselves counts? Or the bottom shell that keeps them attached to their block.</p>\n<p>And in the end, I do not believe it needs to line up 100%. After looking into it, it does seem to line up with the Mollusca Phylum much better than the Arthropoda, but currently Bane of Arthropods is kind of lacking a single niche use-case that would make it worth using.</p>\n<p>Generally if you are encountering nearly any mob of the Arthropoda Phylum in Minecraft, they're spiders, in which case there are other mobs around too</p>\n<p>Silverfish, which arguably could almost be a good reason to have a sword on hand? but even in mountains barely have a noteworthy presence</p>\n<p>Bees, why would you need a dedicated sword to kill bees?</p>\n<p>Cave Spiders, again, there are other mobs to worry about in Mineshafts</p>\n<p>Endermites- again, way too niche to every be handy</p>\n<p>Shulkers would give it a use-case for endbusting</p>",

I’d say we’d mix the designs between our Ideas. But tre3cat, that was a rather weird flex considering I was basing them off of 10% anime and 90% Japanese mythos, We could make many paths to contrast these Minecraft bakenekos and nekomatas with their anime counterparts and grow closer to their Japanese mythos. I thought the anime design would give them a cute look despite not being the wholesome cats they should be. Overall, nice Idea</p>",

However, They are obsessed with two things - quartz and lanterns. Giving a bakeneko who's without their fellow felines will actually tame them. If a neko sees a lantern (be It a nekomata, bakeneko, nekomancer, or the felidians, who could be the 4th and most unique variation, as they are more like ocelots then normal cats..) they will steal It, emitting a satisfied \"meow\" upon doing so.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Each neko type has a set of weapons to choose from. Bakenekos prefer swords or sometimes bows, while nekomatas carry crossbows and sometimes ballistas, a stronger yet slower varient of the crossbow. Felidians could obviously be reliant on blackstone bows and spears, a new type of poking weapon that also exists as a progression weapon, much like the axe and sword, albeit It Isn't as powerful as the trident.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>They have 3 structures: Blackstone towers and cat-tail camps. Felidians prefer to remain in the towers while their more refined relatives remain In the camps. Sometimes you'll see a large tower surrounded by camps, this Is a besalt pagoda, and Is home to the nekomancer, a new nether mini-boss or even a nether boss.</p>",
