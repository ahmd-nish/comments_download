Really, the most a crafting recipe could ever use is 9 logs, and for stairs, you need 6 planks for four stairs, which for 6 planks you only need two logs, which can be mined in seconds. A lot of wood recipes need sticks, which are extremely easy to get, one log can give you 8 sticks. That can almost fill up all the space in a crafting table. The sawmill is not necessary.&nbsp;</p>",

Another problem with siege engines is that they take creativity out of building one yourself. You could build a cannon if you wanted too, and there are many ways to do it - building a good one is very impressive. If you could create one by placing a single block, this would be taken away.

I can't believe how poor auto smelting and filtering systems still are in minecraft.</p>\n<p>I, like you, like to use auto smelting for various farms. For a gold farm, might I suggest using 2 or 3 filters for each stackable item type. Then your blast furnaces wont get clogged.&nbsp;</p>",
