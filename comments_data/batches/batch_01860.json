This would be a really cool idea to tie into archeology as a whole, maybe having the digs sites have a higher chance of spawning nearby them. Maybe instead of regular feathers, the Quetzalcoatl could drop a “Golden Feather” that could craft spectral arrows and archeology brushes. It would also be interesting if the Quetzalcoatl was “dormant”, looking like a mud statue, and then if you entered a vault of kinds it would wake up and attack. This would embrace Mojang’s theory of “Anything bad could be avoided by the player”. Maybe instead of feeding it to trust you, you could feed it to put it back to sleep, and that would be the only to get past, and similar to the warden, you aren’t supposed to fight it. Anyways, this is a really cool idea and would spice up the swamp biomes.</p>",
