I mean, putting leaves in a bucket of water is something a no-brainer in the wilderness could do. Lots of spices would also be cool, and could be used to make food give back the hears quicker.

Smaller interiors of these buildings cannot afford to use redstone lighting. In larger buildings like theatres and schools, I can hide the redstone wiring in the structure, or I can use the debug stick to turn the lights on. At the moment lanterns are an unrealistic detail to add to my small interiors without the ability to turn them off.</p>\n<p>One problem in survival with toggling a lantern is the light source is being turned off, opening the area up to mob spawning. It would not be practical to have unlit areas in survival.</p>\n<p>Once again, I really want this to be a feature. I would not be a fan of the lantern being powered by redstone signal, however, as having a lever next to the lantern, or redstone dust trailing away from it would be messy. I want to be able to right click the lantern to turn it on or off. It would be consistent with the real life behavior of lanterns, as you can turn them on and off in real life. This would give the lantern more value and set it apart from the rest of the light sources--torches and glowstone can't be toggled, redstone lamps can be with redstone signal, and lanterns can be with a right click.</p>",

(DISCLAIMER: This should be a mod but if you have any other ideas for different features, this is to help create a more \"Minecrafty\" and balanced feature). The ore would have to be spawned exposed to air in the Deep Dark biome. Reason why, if you were mining for the said ore using a technique like strip mining. The risk factor the ore is mean't to present is defeated, as the Warden wouldn't be able to attack you in the small passage way (As of the known features of The Warden during the making of this comment). Second of all, the idea of the Eternal enchantment is amazing, the idea is balanced, as the enchantment would keep your armor (Or Weapons and Tools) from loosing durability for a period of time. But instead of it being something that could be enchanted from an enchantment table it should be found only in Deep Dark Cities, it would match the property of something to try and be everlasting, as how the Cities and Warden seem to have been around for quite some time. That is all I have to say</p>",
