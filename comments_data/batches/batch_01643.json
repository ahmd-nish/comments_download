        "body": "<p>To clarify, I imagine parrot nests as Minecraft’s first stick nests that can naturally spawn throughout jungle biomes — on trees, on the ground, in shallow caves, or even on jungle village buildings (buildings of villages that generated in other biomes that spilled over slightly into a jungle). The natural nest could look similar to (or slightly different from) a player-crafted version. Players could craft a nest from sticks to encourage parrot breeding near their base. While this isn’t perfectly realistic to real parrots, it keeps the system simple and convenient for gameplay. 1/10 of naturally spawning parrot nests will contain a parrot family. 9/10 will be empty. Parrot families will be made even rarer by the fact that once they spawn and you leave the area, they will despawn permanently with the nest they occupied left behind. And to keep the parrot families spawned in, you have to sneak to them with the entire family inside and name tag them to permanently calm them down even though they are wild. This prevents players from killing the family or running away from it and gives players a peaceful choice. Players can also break and obtain natural parrot nests for their own use, ideally with Silk Touch. Parrot families are what natural wild parrots that spawn in 1/10 of parrot nests are called. They are the ones that were mentioned in the post that deal 1/4 a heart of damage.</p>",

One parrot will get pregnant like a turtle (or not depending on what Mojang chooses to implement) and then lay eggs. If the natural parrot family breeds, you will get no XP as you did not breed them. The natural parrot nest will have up to 15 parrots total before they automatically stop breeding on their own. You can destroy a parrot nest and all parrot babies and adults will fall down and all eggs currently inside will break without hatching. Baby parrots at stage 1 of being a baby cannot fly but stage 2 onwards can fly. Baby parrots are always born untamed and the earliest chance you will get to tame them is at their third and final stage of being a baby parrot when they show their adult colors and are slightly smaller than an adult parrot. This would still require parrots to be tamed the same way we know now.</p>",
