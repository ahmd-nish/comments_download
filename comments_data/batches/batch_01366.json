The community totally gets the point of drops and we understand Mojang and Microsoft decisions, but that doesn't mean we support them.\n<br />Shifting to the drop system is a clear evidence that something inside your offices isn't working as it should. Choosing quantity over quality has never been and never will be the right decision. Us players don't need 4 drops per year, we want major updates that significantly add new stuff to the game. We could've waited for 6-8 months and added the happy ghast, the spears, new mobs, etc. release it as 1.22 and call it a day, and we would all be happy.\n<br />The new version numeration system only reflects how Mojang is fully committed to a drop system that the playerbase don't even like in the first place. Not only we've lost our characteristic \"1.\" which kinda annoys me but it's not a big deal. The fact that bedrock and java versions are inconsistent IS a big deal. Isn't it the same game? Weren't you guys supposed to unify both platforms, make stuff consistent, etc? It's soo annoying and it was a really unnecessary change. \n<br />1.21 was probably done with the garden awakens, and maybe the animals re-texturing. We could've perfectly waited for a year no problem without a single drop if everything that came afterwards was in a single major update 1.22 </p>",
