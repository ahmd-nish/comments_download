In infinite worlds if the nether reactor is gotten by converting a world to infinite placing it on the ground without the cobble stone or blocks of gold would spawn a 5x5 nether portal and if you try to activate it using the structure with the 14 cobblestone and 4 blocks of gold it says in chat \"unable to complete ritual\"</p>",

There should be End Sand that can be purple or magenta. This would make the End more vibrant. Caves need to be added, with shulkers and endermites spawning in them, protecting loot. There should be more chorus plants on the ground. Some of them should give players effects, for example, levitate a player or teleport a player randomly. These plants should be pinkish blue and, for some, purple. There should also be a liquid that spawns in holes in the ground. It should give off a bright blue glow and if a player gets into it, it should give them a jump boost or such. Overall this would make the End more beautiful or vibrant. Hope you like the idea.</p>",

Give the end a bit more substance to it, ya know? It feels like they did the bare minimum for it to qualify as it's own dimension sometimes. I do know they did their best though, and it shows. Back to the topic at hand, maybe an endstone variant or end sandstone to give more life to the cities, and maybe end fortresses to show the period where they fought the end dragon and possibly endermen.</p>",

I imagine some sort of purple magma cube on two legs, or the same but floating, and a bit like the glare.&nbsp; And then you need to put like a specific order of items in the shulker end chest to like make sure you get to that precise dimension, and get your items back. But there should be some sort of way to not make it as OP cuz like infinite room every where is just not that balanced some of <em>my</em> ideas would be to like have some sort of mobs that steal your items, or what i like better is that it costs something to get in the dimension, lapiz lazuli would be the perfect fit. Maybe some other magic-like items like redstone, amethyst, sculk shards, blaze rods and more. More expensive ones like sculk shards and blaze rods should give you more room, and maybe some special blocks, that only spawn when you do that. Great idea!</p>",

The pocket dimension as outlined here makes the player's storage system portable, making this a huge upgrade to the value of investing a lot of effort into the storage system, like building an item sorter, and also adds value to having multiple bases in different biomes. Currently, the maximum amount of stuff a player can bring with them to a new location is one player inventory + one chest boat + one Ender Chest, all full of Shulker boxes. With the pocket dimension, that amount becomes infinite. Late game players would be incentivized to create a lot of empty space in the pocket dimension, to build more and more of their base there. This would enable a fully nomadic play style without sacrificing the amenities of a base. It would be a lot easier to keep old worlds alive and move from place to place as biomes get updated.&nbsp;</p>",
