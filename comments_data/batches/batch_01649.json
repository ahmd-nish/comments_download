        "body": "<p>I agree. Here's my concept:</p>\n<p>-Regen: Anything higher than 3 or 4 hunger bars is 1 point of health every 2 seconds (this apply to saturation too). That way you're not forced to eat every single second in a fight. Food should be off of your mind during one (unless golden apples and something new).</p>\n<p>-Hunger: Goes down slower when healing and sprinting / sprint-jumping so that you dont eat as much. Not a big change, just the minimum so that its less annoying</p>\n<p>Every food as an different eating speed (every low hunger food is half the time to eat). Examples: melons, cookies, beetroots, etc</p>\n<p>Mushroom stew and beetroot soup stackable to 16 (like honey bottles) as well as water bottles, but not suspicious stews (because they dont mix together)</p>\n<p>Glistening melon now eatable: normal eating speed, gives 1 heart of healing and better saturation.</p>\n<p>Red and brown mushroom now eatable, but low chance to give hunger, or one of them gives poison because wild mushrooms, idk. Both half an hunger bar, fast eating speed</p>\n<p>-Sprint: Im not sure what to do, but here: when you get hit, slows down slightly to act as if youre injured. Active for 4 seconds unless hit again, that way its now nauseating to get hit by multiple things at the same time</p>\n<p>or</p>\n<p>-My frostbite enchant concept from other post: Frostbite 1 to 2: enchant for swords, axes, tridents, maces and spears. When hit, apply frost</p>\n<p>Frost effect: slows target on hit (same as powder snow) and 1 dmg per 2 seconds. Incompatible with fire aspect. Longer frost with level</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The Benefits of doing this would be that it no longer needs armour to survive in sunlight, and an increase in stats, much like how villager trades are cheaper. This would integrate an already existing mechanic into a new(ish) feature, which will make the game altogether better. Furthermore, this would be a way to improve existing mounts, and benefit the spear as it is an easy way to gain large amounts of speed, therefore making it a very good feature to add into Mounts of Mayhem.</p>",
