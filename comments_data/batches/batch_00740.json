We're not saying that we want the Deep Dark to be a place to rush through. We want a lot of strategy to exist in finding the materials you need to finish the game. The Deep Dark is actually the perfect place to do this. You have to be very stealthy, which means that in Speedruns it will be a matter of trade-offs. Would you rather take the risk, stealth and get slowed down to get your Ender Pearls and potentially a lot of boosts that could save the run, or rather rush through the Nether with a lot of different risks to get them, as it is faster? I'd say for expert speedrunners who intend to get world records, it'd be definitely better to just do it the old way, since you don't want to get slowed down. However if you just want to have fun and are taking your time a little bit more, like about 1 and 1/2 hours, it might definitely be worth investing time and effort in stealthing around the Warden if you're going to get huge boosts.</p>",

This effectively halves FPS, and the devs have already said they don't want to implement shadow mapping as of now.</p>\n<p>2. Reflections are definitely possible, and some vanilla resource packs can already do it in the snapshots.&nbsp; Level of detail (based on distance, I assume) wouldn't be too easy to implement, but i'd imagine it'd be possible.</p>\n<p>3: What do you mean by quality? Render quality is pretty much the only global quality, but that'll hurt FPS a lot. The best solution here would probably be AA/AF, and Minecraft already has FXAA (It is disabled by default, you have to use a mod/resource pack to enable it.)</p>\n<p>And finally, 4: This would break so much, I don't even know where to start. First of all, users on macOS would have significant issues, as this blocks all OpenGL 3/4 features due to apple restrictions. Second, this would likely break mod compatibility quite a bit, and finally third: This would have practically no use. There is almost no benefit in using legacy OpenGL vs Core. And for players who can't play because of Core 3.2, this was coming for a long time, the system requirements have reflected this. Old hardware needs to become unsupported at some point, to advance features.&nbsp;</p>",
