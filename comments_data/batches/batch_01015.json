Especially for those with Microsoft accounts which are linked to both, e.g. Xbox Game Pass users, so that it would enable the saving of any minecraft world generated on either PC or mobile device online, loadable and playable between either device.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The depth of play would increase immensely, being able to play the same world regardless of where we are in the \"real\" world. For me it's one of the biggest drawbacks (and failures) of the current Minecraft.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If necessary why not set up or utilies an online platform similar to the Xbox game pass, but only for the saving of content via data packages, downloaded and run only using the devices' hardware. Considering Xbox profile progress is saved across almost every other game which has become compatible with Xbox game pass' online platform. E.g. Any Halo campaign can be played, I would suggest it's definitely with the momentum of gaming at the moment.</p>",

I would prioritize implementing this in one of the release candidates or snapshots.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Instead of a double chest to collect only a maximum of 54 discs, it can collect up to 54*16 discs (if discs can be stackable up to 16) or 54*64 (if discs can be stackable up to 64). This would allow players to organize their storage systems, collections, and/or auto-sorters without suffering from space deficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The argument of 'rarity' is combated by our ability to automate disc farms, which makes them more common than when discs were first introduced back in the early Beta Java Edition. Chests scattered in the world may grant players discs, where duplicate discs are possible and would take up inventory space during their adventures. Multiplayer gamemodes like Skygrid or Survival with \"Resource World\"s would make music discs much more common.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In real life, discs are thin objects, and an adult can carry about 10-15 discs in one hand. Compared to Eggs, where 2-4 eggs can be carried carefully. It wouldn't make sense for discs to not be stacked while eggs are stacked up to 16. Same argument for ender chests, empty buckets, empty/honey bottles, and banners.</p>\n<p>If a player were to hold 16 \"Lena Raine - Pigstep\" discs, thereafter right-clicked on a jukebox, it would only insert 1 disc.&nbsp;</p>",

However, 37 blocks wouldn't be too effective, considering the new cave generation and biomes. Note that they have already lowered the void to about -64 and allowed custom height limits using custom worlds in snapshot 20w49a, so they will technically increase the height limit; the challenge is with Bedrock Edition performance. You can be optimistic about that, since they probably have a plan for Bedrock Edition if they are increasing it on Java. Your idea would be great if everything fails, but it seems that it might not fail after all ;).</p>",
