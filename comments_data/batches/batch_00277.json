It just didn't meet everyone's standard of how it would work like with older mods where you could use scaffolding kinda identical to what it is today but it had no limit you could build and maneuver around with the scaffolding making it an actual useful block and knowing Minecraft it's not realistic at all so I don't see the point in having scaffolding have a limit makes building much harder and the cost of it is just not worth it for building so really I think if someone wants the look and feel of a construction site then definitely have scaffolding dotted around make it look like the scaffolding is actually supported but if you're using it for practical use it shouldn't have a limit.</p>",

So Yes, this is a much needed feature. Only, I'd rather it can push entities up to 16 blocks away, also it can accelerate a downward falling mob such that it takes more fall damage over the same distance compared to unaccelerated falling. This could also work as a mob conveyor, especially useful in the Nether where water cannot be used. I'd imagine the crafting recipe to be like that of the Dropper, but with a Breeze Rod in the center.</p>",

Adding gravity to most blocks in the game would break the game in so many ways and would change the game way too much.</p>\n<p>A tool to rotate blocks could be a great addition, as you pointed out blocks cannot be rotated which limits building quite a bit especially with rails and other connecting blocks.</p>\n<p>A better way to add your idea would be through controllable entities like horses and boats which give a smooth movement and better controls. Adding bigger boats and a flying vehicle of some form could work if the devs want to add that :) I personally still think the game lacks a true reward for getting that ender dragon egg and should make the ender dragon tamable and ridable :)</p>",

Dinnerbone tweeted earlier that the team now has guidelines on which blocks should have walls (stone and brick varieties) and which should have fences (wood varieties,) but pointed out that nether brick fences are an inconsistency. In addition, the 3x2 block recipe is normally used for walls, not fences. This partially resolves the issue..</p>\n<p>2. <strong>To Represent Spikes</strong>. Shouldn't nether structures be spikier? Currently, the only way to represent dense spikes is with End rods, but those give off light and are the wrong color for many builds.</p>\n<p>3, <strong>For Other Details</strong>. Struts or narrow side supports on bridges, alternative bars for a cage, steeples. Imagine any build where you'd like a narrow post, but don't want it to connect the way fences, glass panes, or iron bars would, or want it to be horizontal, or don't want the color and light properties of an End rod. (I'd actually like to see sticks be placeable the same way End rods are, but I kept this to one idea per post.)</p>",
