        "body": "<p>I really doubt it will be added, but I am a strong advocate for some version of the bundle (if not the base version, than an late game upgraded version like a \"compression sack\") be added to the game. The main purpose of the bundle is to remove junk from exploring, but a lot of the junk we get are things like bows and swords dropped by skeletons and nether mobs. Being able to put up to 8 unstackable items in a bundle will allow us to make tool kits that take up only one stot instead of 8 and would free up so much storage. It would also address issues with potions, allowing us to store 8 potions in a single slot so we can do tasks like working in the nether or underwater for longer periods of time without taking up shulker boxes worth of storage or constantly refueling.</p>\n<p>The one key exception that must be made are shulker boxes; just like they are now, they must not be placeable in a bundle.</p>\n<p>Also, something that stacks to 16 like Ender Pearls should also benefit from this system. Right now you can put 16 Ender Pearls or Signs in a Bundle (each one uses 4 units), but it should be more like 32 per bundle (2 units per). Basically here is the equation:</p>\n<p>Normal Stack in Inventory =&gt; Stack in Bundle<br>1 per stack =&gt; 8&nbsp; per bundle (8 units per)<br>16 stack =&gt; 32 per bundle (2 units per)<br>64 per stack =&gt; 64 per bundle (1 unit per)</p>",

It will only take one circuit for complex recipes to work easily. A non-technical player will never use the crafter for anything complicated if this feature does not come in. The only downside I see is that this might possibly be too powerful - but it really only provides easy access to the feature for everyone.

I guess two different textures is okay for resource pack reasons, but it also feels weird and not needed, like a strange inconsistency or something. I know this is being done for the armor trims, but I feel like the current item glint fits perfectly fine on armor, and the trims would still be visible. 1.15 also made the glint too strong; a texture mimicking pre-1.15's glint would look nicer too, although I guess it didn't glow in darkness then. The current armor glint is way too subtle, imo it's not nice having moments where the glint can't be seen.</p>\n<p>The potion glint removal also feels like it hurts the magic. The current item glint seems subtler than 1.7's, so removing it seems very strange. Removing it also makes water bottles, no effect potions, and water breathing potions very similar, since at least water breathing had the glint, while the no effect potions didn't (night vision may have this issue too). I guess the current glint could make potions appear very purple for a moment in the animation, but still it doesn't seem like it'd obscure the colors too much; at least, I didn't notice troubles with them, but I see others have...maybe if they had a different animation that kept the magic touch?</p>\n<p>Other than the enchantment glint stuff (besides the nice and clean item glint, it's cool), I think what's been done has been awesome.</p>",

I understand that sending the full input text while typing has certain privacy/security implications but sending the text when the user actually presses enter would work around it. This would allow servers to still modify chat in a transparent way and for players to acknowledge (and even sign) modified messages and know the server wont be able to change what they said. The way it is implemented now completely removes this trust between the player and the server.</p>\n<p>One could say that because the modified marker and the original text will still show when hovered this wont be as big of an issue but I feel like many people will only read the text and already judge what was said without hovering over (potentially every) message to see what was modified. And even if they do, the damage to the reputation of the player might already be done (e.g. a ban by a too hasty mod or just a \"friends\" group). Re-adding the preview in a toned down way would help there (and the players that don't want the two enter presses for the preview acknowledgement and just want to trust the server could just disable it in the options)</p>",

        "body": "<p>okay here is my feedback, if i dont' mention something it's cause its perfect:</p>\n<p>- the bamboo wood type texture looks pretty bland, its outline isnt super defined wich makes it look out off place especially when used on its own, and there is no variation at all in the texture, from what i checked online (and saw irl) stacks of dried bamboo are very diverce in texture (some peaces of bamboo are a bit darker/brownish, some are a bit redish, etc..) but the texture rn is very uniform; am comparing this to tilled deepslate which has suttle but very nice variants in dark-grey colors, having those suttle variants would make the bamboo wood set look much better eather on its own or with other blocks</p>\n<p>Edit: after some consideration/analysing of the texture, what makes it awkward to use isnt the lack of outline or variation, instead its the very bright yellow (and its slight green tint) wich is very hard to blend with anything else in the game</p>\n<p>- am surprised we didnt have a haybell style block for the bamboo family, i think having a rotational bamboo \"log\" or \"stack\" or wathever with a top/bottom texture showing the holes of the cut bamboo (and maybe a green rope holding the stack together like on the raft texture) would look very very nice</p>\n<p>- and finally, the leap animation of the camel looks a bit janky, especialy the legs part, i think it needs reworking, or just working in general</p>\n<p>and Voila ! that was my feedback, hope it was usefull and maybe even taken into consideration ;)</p>",

Still think it needs to be fixed. I think if a mob is ridden (camels, llamas, horses), it should be effected by slow falling (I imagine it may be for balance instead of a bug since spider jockeys are unaffected, but I want slow falling camel yeet for funny mountain descents).<br><br>Camels with slow falling should still descend slowly. Would be a great niche use for their jumps and could make for fun extreme camel parkour. Its not too OP and can make for a subpar but funny early game elytra (as it requires you start from a high place and is much much slower with less maneuverability while also requiring brewing potions).</p>",

While I love these decorative non-full blocks like hanging signs, the devs seem like they're only interested in satisfying intrinsically-motivated players, judging from Minecraft Live.</p>\n\n<p>I like to build, but building is NOT the main reason why me &amp; my friends buy Minecraft. It's the survival mode that we like. We build bases to protect ourselves, we like to adventure &amp; fight mobs to get loot that is useful for survival. Many players are extrinsically motivated, and if mobs like glow squid, goats &amp; frogs only give decor items as rewards, then they won't bother. It's a consistent problem lately, and now sniffer is (yet again) giving only decor items without any survival use. I love these ancient plants, but we NEED to have both aesthetics &amp; function.</p>\n\n<p>Minecraft was dying on 1.12, but it became popular again after 1.13, 1.14, and 1.16, because there's actually more than just building. We have tridents &amp; netherite, which are useful items for survival, and we have more adventure &amp; combat. I want a game, not just a 3D building app. Many Minecraft mods like the Aether, and Minecraft-inspired games like Terraria &amp; Hytale understand this. It's not just aesthetics &amp; gimmicks, it's tangible rewards. Maybe Minecraft isn't for me, but there's no alternatives at the moment. Minecraft on mobile/console lack Java mods, Terraria is unfortunately 2D, and Hytale isn't coming out soon.</p>",

Don’t get me wrong it should absolutely do a lot of damage. but i feel like either minimal to no armor, it should be AT LEAST 2 hits before it kills you. I understand this is one person’s opinion and may get overlooked but I personally feel like it’s a bit unbalanced! :) thank you for your time!</p>",

I get that you shouldn't be able to kill the warden, at least not easily, but it shouldn't be impossible to avoid either, because then the only option left is to die. The ancient city loot also just isn't really good enough to warrant actually going into one, unless you *really* want Swift Sneak or a Recovery Compass, and a recovery compass probably isn't going to be very useful to someone who is able to avoid dying while getting one. I really liked how the Warden was in the last snapshot, and I think giving it a ranged attack on top of everything else is just overcompensating.</p>",

The roar animation should only be repeated after the target gets killed, and no other target is immediately detected.</p>\n<p>The Sonic Shriek ranged attack should be less powerful than the Warden's melee attack. This shriek attack should also have other side effects, like forcing pointed dripstone stalactites to fall if the attack happens to hit them. I think the Sonic Shriek attack should also create a status effect that temporarly impairs the players ability to hear other sounds, like a high frequency sound that prevents the player from hearing any other noise until the effect wears off.</p>",

Destroyed shriekers sill summoning wardens and increased smell range was a great fix.

The sonic boom's high damage is necessary considering how slow the animation is, and how there's many distracting mobs behind walls. Now it feels like an appropriate mini-boss!</p>\n\n<p>It's still possible to cheese the sonic boom with a shield, but that might be okay. I like how it's penetrating &amp; homing (to easily kill bats), but with the shield, players can dodge the attack, and there's plenty of telegraphed warnings before it shoots. If players think shield cheese is too OP, booms can deal partial damage to shielded players.</p>\n\n<p>I think the Warden is perfect now. It's a natural disaster meant to be avoided, but for bored players who want a challenge, they can fight them. Considering how OP the Ancient City loot is, the Warden's difficulty needs to match. I'm really hoping there's more challenging enemies &amp; huge dungeons in the future, as many players prefer the combat/looting/RPG part of the game more so than building. Roguelike dungeon dimensions that resets after clearing, and rare equipment drops with varying stats to trade with, will make Minecraft's combat/looting truly infinite.</p>\n\n<p>Allay regen is great, though outposts need to have higher chance of Allays. Ideally there should still be a way to breed/renew Allays. Players won't take them to caves as a mining partner if Allays are non-renewable; they still die easily to creepers/lava.

In both of these cases where the compass would be most useful, it would seem to me that the players in need of the compass would either lack the resources to make the compass, or would have so few echo shards that the compass would be seen as too valuable to risk losing (the good old \"what if I need it more later\" trap that lots of players fall into in games).

Ex: A haste X potion, with a duration of say 1-3 mins would be perfect. This will incentivize players to visit multiple cities to stock up on these potions. This is also much more useful than EGAs, which most people only collect as a novelty.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The sonic attack needs to be weaker, since it's ranged it should say only be 1/4th as strong as its melee. This way players who tower up won't be insta killed, but still would get knocked down which I think is the point of this attack.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Wool should be able to block this attack, similar to how it blocks sculk signals.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>This attack should do an AoE damage to all the mobs in the direction.

Since guardians zone in and laser sight the player before sending the blast, but the warden just blasts in the general direction, it makes sense why the sonic boom would be dodgeable.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Considering the warden is much harder to avoid now, he should spawn less frequently in the ancient cities. A simple way to do that is to just reset the 3 strikes rule after every warden summon. This way the difficulty of the ancient cities is kept in check, while also giving each warden summon a mythical feel as you encounter this now rare, legendary monster.</li>\n</ul>",

        "body": "<p>The blast from the warden does need some work, as it currently just means instant death for the player(in hard)unless you have top level gear, which feels odd given the loot of the city is still more mid level. With the punch, it's actually quite fun with it being so strong, as the player then has to learn how to dodge and trick the warden to survive. The Sonic Blast takes this away, not necessarily because it's powerful, but just because there's nothing for the player to do. There is no way to dodge, no way to block(with the message from devs regarding shields being negated)meaning once it activates, the player basically just has to give up, isn't very enjoyable gameplay.</p>\n<p>My solution is using balance: The blast doesn't lock on to players so they could dodge(but will still work for towering)but it turns into an area affect attack, so the player still has a good chance of being hit. But they still have at least a chance, which is currently not the case at least in the cities where there's plenty of places where both the warden and player gets stuck and can't escape</p>\n<p>one other idea I had to counter this is an item using the echo shards where they could be used to craft a new item(maybe also using the amethyst shards since they're in the cites to)that absorbs some of the blast when hand held, keeping the player alive(but still taking hurt and knock back)This could also give it a charge, so the player could use a micro version of the blast, but has to take a big risk to get it</p>",

Obviously this would make the Allays escape from their cells in mansions or pillager outposts but since they only spawn in structures I think it would be possible to alter their AI so that in these places are unable to move.</p>\n\n<p>Also the player should be able to assign the Allay a notes block with a single left click, because the current fix only causes more lag and confusion for the players. :)</p>",
