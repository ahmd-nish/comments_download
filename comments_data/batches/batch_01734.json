Just have a look on Twitter or Instagram and you will see so many unique creations using Sculk Sensors that were only possible using Command Blocks beforehand. Sculk Sensors could be used to detect any vibrations, not just the breaking or placing of blocks in a certain area like Observers do. You can create systems and contraptions that only trigger when certain actions happen in certain areas using Wool Occlusion and Comparators to determine frequency of vibrations. I've seen people make dynamic pixel art on huge scales using Sculk Sensors, and even making touchpads! I'm not criticizing your idea, I'm just telling you that the possibilities and creative potential of Sculk Sensors exceeds that of almost every other Redstone component, even when it comes to Survival based contraptions like building mob traps or mob farms (for instance, you can make a grinder that is triggered by the movement of mobs inside the mob farm).</p>",
