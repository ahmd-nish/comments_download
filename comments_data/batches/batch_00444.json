The crafting recipe would require 3 materials for the head of the lance and 2 sticks diagonally: e.g. 2 sticks like a fishing pole, then 3 iron in the top middle, top right, and middle right.<br>The lance would be the longest range melee weapon in the game, about 5-6 blocks as opposed to the normal 3 block attack range. This way, lances would be the superior option for horseback as their long range would essentially negate the range loss from being on a horse. The attack power I see them having (in terms of the combat snapshots) is 1.8-2 attack speed and 8.5-9 attack damage for a diamond lance, putting them in a nice spot between axes and swords. I do think that if these were added then there <strong>would </strong><strong>need to be some type of counter</strong> to horses, so I think the effective against horses/mounted players is a good idea (though maybe on a different weapon?). As for the heavy shaft enchantment, I also think that is a great idea, being able to extend attack range in place of using the offhand.&nbsp;It would also be cool to have a special thrusting animation for the lance rather than the normal swipe.<br>Categorizing weapons would be a welcome addition to the game as it would add lots of new combat strategies and make for lots of fun. I hope this gets added!</p>",
