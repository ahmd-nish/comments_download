While this may be true we can all provide suggestions for mojang and give them ideas. Some of these ideas of course as other comments state could be ancient plants, journels, books or bones. I have ideas of my own like the excavation structures is biome dependent on chance like it is a higher chance in badlands, savanna, or dessert as to simulate old dried up lakes and sediment. Also this would add a chance for anew mob that could be hidden in excavations like say a bone crawler or some other mob. The bone crawler would wait last second when you uncover something as to break it and will also add an effect called bones sickness which gives you nausea wither and slowness effects at the same time with a new effect that makes your world seem to get smaller and you see yourself sinking to the ground. I know it's a stretch but it would be awsome so some things could get added in a bit of time please consider thanks for being awsome mojang</p>",

I think it would be cool if it had five enchantment levels, with level I having a 25% chance to make ores smelt, level II have a 50% chance, level III having a 75% chance, and level IV having a 100% chance. By level V, which would have to be made by combining two level IV books on an anvil, the Fortune enchantment would have an effect on the ores the pickaxe would smelt. The enchantment would have an enchantment weight of one, meaning it would have the lowest possible chance of appearing as an option on an enchantment table, due to how overpowered it is. Perhaps if enough people feel it is too overpowered at this point, it could just be a treasure enchantment, making it unobtainable via enchantment table. Also, if enough people feel the level V ability is too overpowered, than I would suggest that it also conflict with Fortune, and have only four enchantment levels, all doing the same thing as described earlier. </p>\n\n<p>What do you guys think of this?</p>",

Olives can be used together with a bottle or a bucket to craft olive oil or eaten by themselves. Olive oil can be used as fuel for a furnace and also another added item, oil lanterns. Another source of oil should be an oil sand block found in the dessert. Oil sand block can be heated in a furnace to get crude oil or sludge.  Sludge can be useless until crafted into a bottle of oil the same way olive oil is. Oil and gunpowder should also be able to create an ignitable fuse. Something like red stone when laid out on a block. Oil sands should also burn when lit by lava, lightning, flint and steel, etc. when the oil sand block has finished burning, it should turn to regular sand. </p>\n\n<p>Oil pockets could possibly be found in sandstone pockets in nearly every biome but only one to two pockets per biome. Dessert biomes may have more. </p>\n\n<p>Oil could be heated in a furnace or blast furnace to create tar. Tar can be used like slime on a piston to create a stick piston or made into a block. Tar block can have the same characteristics of deep snow when stood on and burned. When a tar block is burned it can ignite other adjacent tar blocks very quickly. Tar can continue to burn for a whole in game day. </p>",
