Icy/chilling theme.<br>Heart of the Nether: Alight with blue soul fire, this staff's projectiles have a high chance to light enemies with soul fire which can burn nearby enemies. Increased soul gain rate. Chain reaction enchantment.<br>Tempest's Wrath: projectiles have a chance to arc lightning between multiple enemies dealing low damage. Enemies hit by the projectile are weakened for a short time.<br>Endercurse: Enemies below 20% health have a small chance on each hit to be teleported into the end, gone in a cloud of end particles (still drops loot of course). This does not (for obvious reasons) include end game bosses but has a 1% chance to work on 'mid-game' bosses such as Endermen, Redstone Golems, and Evokers at any health (mean you could technically kill them with one shot and a lot of luck. May sound OP but I have seen players one shot these enemies with regular weapons).<br>Enderwish: If the player falls below 20% health, they will be teleported in a random direction 10 metres away from all hostile mobs( if within 10 metres of a mob). This can trigger every 5-10 seconds, but no sooner. Similar idea to final shout but with a different outcome.</p>",
