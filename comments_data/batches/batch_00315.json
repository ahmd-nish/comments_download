        "body": "<p>The thing is the warden is kind of useless. When it spawns people just run away and wait for it to despawn. It's existence seems kinda pointless. If it dropped something like this it would be good for two reasons. Number 1, Incentive. As it is now, there is no incentive to fight it, making this well designed boss, pointless to fight. Number 2, convenience. Keep in mind, this is an end-game item for after you have defeated the dragon and already found the portal. (maybe it should only spawn after the dragon is killed). You would still need to find the portal, but once you get enough warden hearts, you could craft your own. It is a pain to travel through the nether highway to get to the portal, so for convenience (AFTER DRAGON IS DEFEATED) It would be pretty useful. Sure the loot in the chests are pretty good, but there is still no point to the warden existing. One warden would only drop one heart, so you would need to fight twelve to get a portal. It seems challenging, but would add something the warden needs in minecraft. PLUS there is no current end game content in minecraft so I think this is a REALLY GOOD IDEA. Thank you for listening to my TED talk. goodbye.</p>",
