In this dungeon there will be a necromancer boss, his ability to summon mummies and skeletons with swords or with a bow after death, he drops a normal amount of experience And the necromancer's staff drops from him, it can be used 13-15 times, he summons 3 zombies or mummies. There was also loose sand in this yyome: if you got caught in it, then you break the blocks, just like in the water when the igrot dived to the head, then he died after 3 seconds or 2 seconds.

Below you will find a transcription of the topic being discussed. <br><br><strong>Title:</strong> “Nether distorted forest” <br><br><strong>Text:</strong> “If the name of one of the new biomes in 1.16 is the distorted forest, because of the crooked woods and vines, due to the purple particles that emanate from the place, after staying for a while in that biome, you should start hallucinating, as if the forest would approach and arrest you, but it’s all an illusion and you have to cross the blocks that are part of the illusion. Or even think you're taking damage from some direction but you're not. I think that together with the developers' ideas could make the nether even more interesting and much more challenging, it could also have illusions of depth that you think is walking but the front block is always far away. I thought it would make more sense if milk didn’t cancel out these effects, maybe lessen, but then they’ll come back unless you leave the biome.”</p>\n<p>- Translated by Admin</p>",
