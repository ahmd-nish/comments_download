It could pave the way towards specialty lava biomes, like how there's special water biomes, except this could be much more interesting, with different ways of developing it and not being confined to what it is in reality (like how the water biomes have to imitate real water biomes). It could make creatures like a lava version of a Drowned (maybe a Burned or a Scald? I might suggest this in a different post), plus different lava neutral mobs, like a lava fish. It could make specific lava biomes, like maybe plants that live under lava, special ores and rock under lava that could lead to further potions or armor/tools/weapons with special abilities, and even possibly volcanos (even if they don't erupt). Specifically, these things could be ultra-special, seeing as how it would be hard to get both potions so you can operate under lava, making these resources very coveted. All this needs a potion like a lava vision, though. As of now, you can't see a thing while in lava, which would render all this useless, if it happens.</p>",

If I had a way to determine what the weather will be in foreseeable future (like a day), I can just go about my business without being afraid to miss the thunderstorm away from my base/farm.</p>\n\n<p>Now that copper and amethyst are introduced and they honestly have little use right now, it will be a good idea to use them to craft weather predictor. Especially given that they already have some environment-oriented purposes - crafting lightning rod and spyglass. IMHO, this will be in line developer's vision for these materials.</p>\n\n<p>But I think that weather predictor should be a block, not a tool. In the ancient times people predicted weather based on star movement (think of astrology) and current weather patterns, like a dew, cloud shapes, sky color, etc. So this block should be exposed to sky to work.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe something like a crystal ball. Think of Remembrall from Harry Potter. When the ball is clear the weather will be clear, when it's cloudy there going to be bad weather (rain), and when it is cloudy and flashing - thunderstorm ahead. And this would also nicely fit in quazi-fantasy setting of Minecraft. The ball itself could be crafted from copper, amethyst shards and quartz (given that daylight detector also uses quartz).</p>\n\n<p>It could also output redstone signal with strength based on type of upcoming weather (like 0 for clear, midrange for rain and 15 for thunderstorm) and, when used with comparator, signal strength would instead indicate time remaining for weather change - higher the signal strength, closer the change event.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I like this idea a lot. It would be a good compliment to fishing as well. My only concern is that (as you mentioned) iron and gold take 9 nuggets, yet at a rate of 8% for emerlad and 2% for diamond, these two are far too easy to get relative to the difficulty in getting a full ingot.</p>\n<p>E.g. on average it would take 9/.15 = 60 trials to get 1 iron or gold ingot, while a diamond could be obtained in 1 / .02 = 50 trials. So diamond and emerald would end up being less rare in a sense... Also, I think gold should be a little more rare than iron to keep with the current ore rarity balance... maybe halve diamond and emerald to 4 and 1 percent then put iron up to 20%... or maybe put it to 17% and raise sand gravel and clay by 1%.</p>\n<p>Balance aside I think this is a great idea!</p>",

For me, when they were introducing archeology I was expecting something like new structures that would spawn partly buried under ground and you could dig around them to unearth the structure. With chests inside maybe the clay pot shards could be found only in those chest and that would be neat... But the way mojang presented archeology seemed(sorry mojang) quite awefull. To be honest first of all it looked like a cheesy mod, wich I understand appearence would change, and second of all the mechanics dont feel \"Vanilla-y\" at all. Im quite dissapointed with this feature and while certain parts of the feature could be cool if worked on, the other parts are just not very minecraft-like. I'm shure i'm not the only one that feels like this please help me think of more ideas to hopefully correct this new feature before it changes the minecraft we love in a negative way.</p>",
