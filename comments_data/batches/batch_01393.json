We could even make achievements for the frogs and tadpoles, such as <strong>\"Saved by the babies</strong><strong>\"&nbsp;</strong>where you would have to clutch with tadpoles in a bucket or one more minecrafty, <strong>\"Leap Frog\"</strong> jump from build height with a leashed frog and survive.</p>",
