I wrote the suggestion to leave the actual implementation open to tweaking if it is accepted. I mainly just thought it would be cool if there were something similar to brewing you could do with the breeze rods - I mean you can make a stand out of the blaze rods, why not be able to make one out of the breeze rods since the breeze is the same kinda mob type?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
