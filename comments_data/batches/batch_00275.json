With that said, TNT is not made from gunpowder either so maybe they're not going for realism. Dynamite is also stronger than TNT so it's blast radius would actually be larger.

Don't assume all players are going to build an iron farm! One of its purposes, to repair items, remain underused in part due to the anvil being expensive to replace (the other part being that only restoring 25% item durability if using materials is also very overpriced, considering it often takes only 2-3 of the same material to make the item).<br><br>Being able to repair it similarly to how you feed an iron golem an iron ingot would be consistent with an existing method, but since a right-click normally opens the UI this would mean either the player would have to crouch to repair it, or that the UI will not open if right-clicked while holding the repair material. Both solutions would be acceptable imo.<br><br>Since the anvil actually breaks after taking damage only three times (and there only being a 12% chance of it taking damage) a single iron ingot is understandably too cheap to repair it. Instead an iron block (equating to 9 iron ingots) would be a reasonable cost for repairing 1 stage of damage. If further balancing is needed then the chance of it taking damage could also be adjusted.<br><br>Either way, please consider this!</p>",
