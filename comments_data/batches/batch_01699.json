At least it would be more intuitive if it couldn't pull ice because we know ice has a special property in Minecraft, we can notice that it's slippery.

This results in version changes when only minor tweaks have occurred between drops. I feel the reason Mojang would choose to do this would be to have an excuse to increase the version number every year after a bunch of drops, and while this can be an easy solution for them to update the version, this is (believe it or not) completely unnecessary. There’s no reason for a larger scale increment that occurs specifically once a year. It adds no benefit. I would suggest keeping your drop vs minor formatting and propose we just keep 1.21 as the version for now. If there’s a time when enough is added that Mojang feels the need to increment to 1.22, then go for it. But for now I agree that this “solution” fails to actually solve anything, as you have mentioned.</p>",
