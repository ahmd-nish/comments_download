Or, even safer, are accessed by random doors/gateways that appear leading to a pocket dimension, which only last for 100 in-game days. This means anything left in one will vanish, if a player is in one when it expires has two consequences. For easy or normal they are booted back to the overworld where they entered. For Hard and Hardcore death in the void. I feel this kinda Event would fit perfectly with the magic and dimensions magic established by Mojang. I saw a mod that sorta touched on this but the player crafted the doorways. I like the idea a bit more as some dungeon event, but would love an end game personal pocket dimension I could craft access to for a traveling base.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This could also be a fun way to limit Warden and Skulker sensor access if they are features in this pocket dimension that only periodically occur. Or some new mobs that give hints of changes, origins, of the desolate end. Perhaps the \"End\" is the space between dimensions, the End Dragon the force that keeps a society form traveling across the worlds again. and Endermen the monitors of the worlds.</p>",

That seems more natural to us than as a stand alone area.<br><br>We thought all of the following would be great additions to Minecraft:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Add grave yards and add special features of that area.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\"Grave stones\" (new one block high head stones) would mark several \"special locations\" called \"graves\" (new two block area) that could spawn skeletons. ( At a much lower rate than a spawner. Maybe one a night at midnight? ) And, the \"grave\" would need to have \"buried bones\" to spawn skeletons. Maybe the \"Graveyard\" could also have \"unmarked graves\" (lacking head stones) that would work the same way too.<br><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe the \"graves\" could spawn other monsters too. Based on a buried head of the monster to be spawned. ( This way players could use the graveyard as a \"custom spawner\" for specific resources.)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And maybe any mobs spawned in the graveyard during a \"new moon\" would have extra hearts or more powerful weapons. (And maybe better item drops too?) That would increase the likely hood of spawning \"Dullahan\" ( The lord of the graveyard ) too!

It’s not possible for piston doors as pistons can’t move obsidian, but it would be the case for the walls with 1×1 holes, and of course all the external walls, floors and ceilings. The outside should look nicer, so a layer of another block should cover the obsidian.</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Many chorus fruits should be found inside as loot, to make sure that the player can always leave. Also, maybe the right way to make it work is to add a special block, on which players teleport themselves if they eat a chorus fruit near enough. This block would be placed at the entry and the player will be able to take it after disabling the Mining Fatigue.

First, you can complicate the processes for opening doors, for example by putting a button and a door at both ends of a corridor with several turns, or adding the small windows I talked about between them, or jumping elements or high steps you would have to teleport yourself in. At the beginning of the dungeon, it would be simple, but at the end, there would be a real obstacle course!</p>\n<p class=\"western\">Second, about the small windows: to prevent the player from using water or trapdoors to crawl in, they could be smaller than 1×1, using slabs or even stairs. As there are no obsidian slabs or stairs, the window can still be blown up with TNT but in a small room, the player would also take damage. And TNT costs more than ender pearls in the End…</p>",
