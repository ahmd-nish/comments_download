To decrease the Mob Farm have these pocket dimensions be more like events, lasting only about 4 hours real-time (12 game days) and then they close and regenerate. On Peaceful and Normal a player trapped inside would be teleported to the archway, Hard and Hardcore would fall to void, items stored in chests in the dungeon would be lost. Every game day a gong/alarm would do the count down from 12 rings. So if you only hear 1 gong in the dungeon you have 20 minutes to escape. This would allow for mixing blocks/mobs from all dimensions, so you never know your loot, or danger you will face in what combination. As an optional risk/reward with no ability to farm and a limited time frame, I think would add playability. Especially if they even only start randomly every few full moons. And while Minecraft is all about making your own \"Quests\" most being building ones, this would add an adventure/combat approach.&nbsp;</p>",
