Tweaking community guidelines in search of a compromise (something that seems to have already been done between snapshots) won't help; there's only one solution: an option to direct reports to the server owner instead, or to disable them completely.</p>\n<p>The reason is simple: Mojang or Microsoft shouldn't have a say in moderating private servers. Those servers are owned by and paid for by third parties; those parties are the ones to establish the rules. If a server owner decides that they need get help from external moderators to stay family friendly, then it should be their choice. If they decide to welcome \"toxic\" players or questionable discussions, then again, it should be their choice. Minecraft Java is one of the most customizable games in existence, so having control over one's playstyle is essential, and this includes online behavior.</p>\n<p>Mods that disable reporting have already started to appear; many server owners are pondering whether they'll stay on 1.18 or switch to offline mode. This has every chance to create a rift or become a technological arms race where Microsoft will be adding more technical limitations or updating the EULA, and the community will be coming up with new workarounds. No one needs such a resource sink and the hostility that'll come with it. Giving the server owners an option to disable these reports will fix the issue.</p>",

This way servers would have their own rating (maybe with a pop-up for 18+ to make sure you want to connect to them?) and it's up to the parent to make sure the child is sticking to what's appropriate for them. Maybe add parental control settings too, so the parents can fully disable connecting to 18+ servers?<br><br>That being said I doubt Mojang will be able to do anything about it. This is clearly Microsoft's doing and considering Bedrock censors signs and world names in singleplayer, this is very likely the direction they're heading for Java as well. At this point we're better off proposing that Mojang buys itself back from Microsoft and gets at least Java edition, back.</p>",

That was bad enough, but there's more. When I rejoined, I rejoiined back in the end. The dragon egg was gone. It was not on the pedestal either. If it weren't for realm backups, the dragon egg would be gone for this ridiculous feature that adds nothing to gameplay. We need your votes to remove this feature.

Since most servers are idle most of the time, it only costs them about 1-2% of what it would cost to keep the servers always running. Of course, this is bad for Minecraft for a few reasons:</p>\n<p>a) bad customer experience<br>b) server costs are relatively cheap<br>c) Minecraft is owned by MICROSOFT, who owns the cloud computing platform they use, so they're not even paying full price for server time. If competitors can offer always-on servers at a competitive price, then surely it's even easier for Minecraft to do so.</p>",

        "body": "<p>While this is a good idea, I think that you might underestimate how much 12 chunks really is. Each chunk is a 16*16 \"chunk\" (hence the name) of blocks. So, from one direction away from the player, there would be 12 times 16 blocks. This is 192 blocks in each direction from the player. Now, yes, you can definitely go for more, but if you think about it, that's nearly 0.2 kilometers. That might not sound like much, but believe me when i say that you can see pretty far.</p>\n<p>That being said, Realms is a premium service, with premium-pricing. You can get very similar performance for a much lower monthly price elsewhere. Realms has many benefits over these other hosting providers, such as being invite-only so unwanted individuals can't get on. It also comes with many fun minigames. However, these other hosting providers can utilize the whitelist feature built in to mojang's dedicated server software. And, they don't limit your render distance. (However, raise the limit on render distance at your own risk to additional server lag.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So, while 12 chunks certainly isn't a small amount, it can be improved upon, and for a service that costs $8/month with recurring subscription (that also limits other things like playercount), there is certainly room for improvement.</p>",

If my monthly cost was enough for that render distance back then, with the cheaper computing available now, it should most certainly be possible to increase render distance a few chunks now. But yes, as someone pointed out, increasing render distance increases server load exponentially. If the render distance is 10, then a 20x20=400 chunk area is visible. Increasing the render distance to 20 would mean that a 40x40=1600 chunk area is visible. So, doubling the render distance quadruples the server load.

It would be great to give the players the options to pay a little bit extra to get more performance. Before 1.18 the render distance was acceptable but something messed that up. I really like the concept of the realms, but the render distance should be at 20 or something like that. We don't need 96 chunks like in the local saves, but more then 10. I understand that because of the bigger caves more blocks need to be rendered. But on the other hand there is a lot of air that is relative easy to render.</p>\n<p>I don't think that an Xbox One or Series X/S or the other devices arent capable to do more then 10 chunks, a solution has to be found. I also don't believe that the servers struggle with more then 10 chunks. I mean my other computer is running on an very old gtx580 and this is capable to do more then 20.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I have to say that the fun of the game really isn't that great with this problem. Exploring is kind of horrible and not even my whole island is visible and it only has a size of 150x150 blocks.</p>",

Not to mention if a player is using a hacked client and causing chaos. This is a neccesity if im going pay for the new realms plus.

The option to play xbox multiplayer is either <strong>allow</strong> or <strong>block</strong> and no option for just friends (Microsoft probably need to handle this one too).<br>Although when it is set to block they can see each other online on Minecraft, press invite, but they can't actually join each other's worlds as it specifies they can't play online in a message.<br><br>On the other hand if the servers were hidden they would be able to play online by inviting their approved friends (thanks to Xbox having an option for parents to authorise friend requests) to play in their created worlds, whilst also blocking Realms and in app purchasing.</p>\n<p>Keeping Minecraft friends and family connected, wherever they are, just as if they were playing on LAN together.</p>",

Luckily, in Java Edition you can define a \"server-ip\" and multiple IPs can be used on a single server. This allows the ability to use DNS Records for \"A Records\" or \"SRV Records\".</p>\n<p>In Bedrock Edtion they're many clients who want to use the \"Default Port\" which is 19132. Unfortunately, in Bedrock Editon you <strong>cannot</strong> define \"server-ip\" and only allows the ability to use the first IP address of the server.</p>\n<p>The reason why clients sometimes want this is that they can still set up a \"Sub Domain\" for Bedrock Edition as it points to an IP address using an \"A Record\" and if they have the default port. Users don't have to change the input of that port.</p>\n<p>If a host has a 100 Dedicated Servers and each of them has 5 Dedicated IP addresses, that would potentially be 500 clients using IP:19132 vs. With the current setup you can only do 100 clients using IP:19132 as it's limited by not defining a \"server-ip\".</p>\n<p>SRV Records would also be a plus as this would remove the \"Port Field\" from the Bedrock Edition, and you could then have the same 100 Dedicated Servers and host single-ip:many ports, but with SRV Support it would hide that port.</p>\n<p>TLDR;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add server-ip with (IPv4 and IPv6 support) Java has this.</li>\n<li>Remove the port field from Bedrock Editions.</li>\n<li>Add SRV Support</li>\n</ul>",

On several occasions hackers and griefers join just to create chaos, so introducing a probationary membership could help Owners and Admins manage these players with ease. The settings for the realm can be changed from \"no one can do anything\" to \"everyone is op\", but this is way to broad. Id like it broken down a bit more and on an individual basis. Promoting someone to Admin without cheats or having no achievments, is pointless. Setting up an ituitive player management system will greatly improve the value of owning a Realm.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Admin Commands- Things such as /kick, /freeze player, /ban, /tempban, /logplayer, /tp, /fly /invisible, etc could really help manage a community. These are just a few basic ideas. Main point, we need more control over settings regarding our chosen server staff.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Player Logging- Simple enough. Log join and exit times, placement of TNT, Lava and other such griefing materials. Also detecting if block reach is beyond game basics and alerts for hackers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Spawn area options- Sometimes you spend weeks making spawn just right, and in 5 minutes its burning to the ground. Spawn should have a specific radius that owners can change gamerules without cheating. Things like tnt and creepers exploding, fire tick and even who can place and break blocks in spawn. This would be way easier than trying to upload a backup on slow connections.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

What I'd like to make this post for, is to help other realm owners, as well as players, help get the message across to Mojang that this is what collectively is needed to bring the Bedrock platform forward! Realms player activity, enhanced administrative features! NOT just some cheap \"realms plus\" marketplace content.  \n<br />I've gone ahead and have made a list of some posts on the official feedback website which I encourage you check out to help make this noticed:</p>\n\n<p>Making these changes to the Bedrock realms would vastly improve the platform ability to facilitate smp's and communities to grow, and for owners to be in control of their realm. Not just that, but it helps the plugins and other player made features to be easily implemented to realms.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for your time reading this post. I hope it isn't taken as advertisement, because its a topic I genuinely think needs to be talked about more when mc realms come to mind.</p>",

So I am hoping that it has been enough time for them to add the very obvious next step which is to take the experimental thing off, or simply let realms and servers also enable experimental gameplay. If not i am going to suspect that they are just afraid of empowering their users to compete with their own business model. Forcing people to play on a few rather limited 'trusted' servers is not my idea of a good business model, so i hope that isn't what they are aiming at. The good business model is the Roblox model, and the Java Edition model. Let people create what the want and share it with their friends. If you can do that again across multiple platforms now that they did such an awesome job with Bedrock edition, then they will double their billion dollars that was spent on this game. Don't try to lock people into your business model. Just skim off the top of people doing what they want to do with a perfect game for creativity.&nbsp;<br><br>Man if this thing doesn't come at the next Minecon i I'm going to be very disappointed in the direction of this game.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Windows 10 needed to have Bedrock Edition as it was important for PC users to cross play with others. This is one of the ways to maximize profit since PC hadn't been touched yet. You won't see Mac or Linux users get bedrock since Windows 10 is owned by Microsoft and it encourages players to get Windows instead of Macbooks or Linux devices. This is the same exact case as Fortnite which has cross play with PC and phones (IOS only at the moment) and for Fortnite to maximize sales they have to release it on mobile (pretty much any 3rd party developer will do this for most of the games if its doable). Think of Microsoft as a 3rd party company when they have it on non-microsoft&nbsp;devices such as the Nintendo Switch and Phones. Now for the fact you can't win any games with MCPE is FALSE because it is possible to win a couple of games under certain circumstances. But the majority of the time you will lose which is where this hate is coming from. Certain Servers (even the featured servers) have a system where damage is done differently on each device (Windows 10 being lowest, Consoles in Middle, and MCPE with highest damage). I actually have lost to a MCPE player before due to this system on Windows 10 but it rarely happens for me since I know how to play Java edition. There are also servers which are aimed towards Mobile Devices such as BrokenLens (Biggest server that isn't featured) and Nethergames. Certain games are nerfed on windows 10 players and buffed on MCPE devices. Personally i perform much better when its all MCPE players on my Android Device. The ONLY reason they can do this is because of the lack of being a featured server. Featured Servers have to be fair to all cross platform&nbsp;users because where will Windows 10, and Consoles play if its all geared towards MCPE for instance. They cannot Discriminate a certain platform for a featured server as Microsoft needs money. Like I said it is possible to win certain games with Android/IOS: All team based games are possible to win with android/ios because you are working with other players who might happen to be using Windows 10 or Console. You are doomed if its only MCPE players on ur team so get yourself a friend who has Windows 10/Console and play with them in a party in games like Cake Wars. Block Hunt is possible to win on ur Android/IOS. One in the Quiver is actually possible to win but under an extreme circumstance must the players be bad in the game. Trust me its doable Ive&nbsp;gotten a Monster Kill (7 kills in a row) before on that game. Gladitators is not possible if your opponent is smart with his Windows 10/Console. This is because MCPE requires u to trap ur opponent in a corner to win. Dragon escape is IMPOSSIBLE due to players having better jumping controls so I would avoid that game at all costs. Skywars, SG or any Solo PVP game on a featured server is impossible to win because of the cross play. Trust me you cannot win most of the time. I know Casual Games are great on the phone such as Prison so it would be worth getting a Prison pass on Lifeboat. The only other games I know where you cannot win with MCPE are TNT run and even that pay to win game Inpvp has called Space Race. This is because Parkour sucks with touchscreen controls. The only worry Consoles(controllers) have are very good Windows 10 players such as me using Keyboard and Mouse. Theres two solutions you can do in order to win more games: one use a controller for ur phone instead. However this will not work on most phones and some phones such as the Moto E4 Plus have Partial Controller Support even for Xbox 360/Xbox One controllers. The other solution would be to only play on BrokenLens and Nethergames who are friendly toward MCPE users. That's about it for this long post just needed to get some things out of the way.</p>",

You're basically complaining that Windows 10 users have&nbsp;more powerful devices and more control options. That's not their fault. They have an objectively better device that is capable of doing more things. Also, some of your suggestions are patently absurd.&nbsp;Unless I am very much out of the loop, Windows 10 users&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong> have built in auto clicker or have the ability to insta-break blocks (unless they are in creative, in which case, so do you).</p>\n<p>So I would recommend trimming down your list to things that might actually be possible to add, like making it easier to go into F5 mode or punching&nbsp;the air. Make specific recommendations that would work across all devices. If you can't do that, I'm afraid nobody will take your feedback seriously.</p>\n<p>Edit: I noticed you added some recommendations, but&nbsp;<strong>it's not specific</strong>. Tell us exactly how you would be able to move the screen and hit at the same time. Also, just making MCPE-only servers probably isn't going to happen, that would defeat the whole purpose of the&nbsp;Better Together update.</p>",

Then of course they must move after your the only neighbor left and they die to Xbox players better at PVP in general. I don’t care though because I suck at PVP.

Bridging works the same on all platforms. An idea that a lot of people seem to not think about from what I've seen is the addition of new buttons, custom controls, and multi touch support for more than two fingers. Fortnite mobile has crossplay with PC and console players, for example, but if you have a good HUD layout and use at least  4 fingers to play (thumbs and pointers) you can compete decently. This could probably also be the case with MCPE if they did the same. The current PE controls are very good for casual on the go play, but when being put up against other platforms, it cannot keep up.</p>",

It's so annoying how fast you can click too as players can literally kill you in seconds, And speed bridge as that's why I spend more time on hive playing Deathrun.

I find it that mobile players are at a far disadvantage since pc and console players have more movement or control over their character than mobile players do. First off mobile players can’t aim and hit at the same time and they have no customizability to their controls like pc and console. Second you can only control your character with 2 fingers on the buttons unless you switch the sneak and jump buttons than you can jump and walk whilst looking. Third pc players can modify their came for saying autoclicker and for console players they can use a strike pack on their controller. Now lastly they should add a option to toggle on and off crossplay or add more buttons and ways to aim to counter pc and console players. What I mean by this is you can see other games like Call Of Duty Mobile or Pixel Gun 3D you have availability to move and resize buttons and they have more options to move aim and shoot. With this mcpe should do the same.</p>",

I could simply run multiple instances of that (with different names) and connect to the one I want...But itd be hard to share with my friends. I do have a VPN set up, so I could let them connect to that so they are then on the LAN. Otherwise, to NAT multiple IPs, I'd have to reserve more IP addresses from my internet provider which is costly. So then I guess host a server in the cloud, but again, comes with a cost that I'm avoiding by hosting at home.</p>\n\n<p>So you may want to use the Docker trick and map multiple ports.

So each container needs to map out a different external port to the internal default port for it to work. Then you need your router to open a port and forward traffic to the containers external port. Then with a ddns service like DuckDNS or No-ip, you can get your friends to access your server through the ddns hostname and router open port.\n<br />It would be great to have a lobby function in the bedrock dedicated server.\n<br />Version 1.14 of the dedicated server works very well. We recently had8 people on ours to kill the Ender Dragon. Worked like a charm.</p>",

Is probably one of the quickest ways they can ruin it. </p>\n\n<p>It's genuinely ridiculous, the extent to which they're going. In any system, there are flaws. Someone will eventually get banned who didn't deserve it. A mod has a bad day. They get the wrong player. Not allowing that player to *ever* access anything in the game again due to one decision by a moderator is genuinely a terrible way of going about things. Then going further and denying them access to even features that aren't online is almost criminal. Especially when this extends to places such as realms, *where the realm owner should have control over what goes or does not on their server*, as *they control who is and is not allowed into it*, and the responsibility should be on them to moderate their own spaces. </p>\n\n<p>Not only that, but realms should be private. The thought of someone going through what I'm saying to other people on my own realm is just freaky. Even if it is only messages that are reported. And putting anything, ai or human, in charge of moderating that, other than the owner of the realm, is not ok, as they are not in tune with what is or is not permitted on that server. </p>\n\n<p>This isn't even mentioning the fact that you don't get a refund for anything. Especially on bedrock, where you literally have to pay for skins and textures. It will alienate players and kill the game. \n</p>",

With that said, we have little to no options with the server application. I've found some things that can make it easier (Seriously, check out Minecraft Server Manager, it streamlines everything). But even then, little to no options, and ZERO ability to use betas. Even with the Server manager, it has game rules with experimental gamesplay set to false, but you cant change them to true. Honestly, i feel like if we were just given control of a few more things, it would open up our servers to be more manageable.</p>",

I don't expect 20 chunk render distances, but I actually went in and did direct comparisons between Realms and Single Player, same seed, same location (slightly different generation quirks) and I would honestly estimate the current Realms render distance at <strong>8 or 9 chunks, </strong>which strikes me as unacceptable really.</p>\n<p>I guess it's lucky that this is technically my free trial, as we may well just get a third party server at this point.</p>",

Hardware has become more powerful since this distance was set. And there have been many opportunities for performance to be optimised. For the most popular game in the world to have this neglected for so long, the excuses are running out. It makes me question my Realms subscription, when it means that I cannot fully appreciate a core part of the game that is open-world exploration and construction.</p>",
