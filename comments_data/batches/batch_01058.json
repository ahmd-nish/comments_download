My Third Idea is: add in these ores; Magmastone Ore, Phantom Blood Ore, Blue, Red, Green, Yellow, Orange and White Magicite Ores. And My Fourth and Final Idea is: adding in Ather-like Sky islands that you need a new item for and name the items the cloud gems and then make like a glowstone version of the end portal but with phantom Frames in each corner that requires the gems and a special item called the Sky Tome. And call the 1.20 Update the Mystic Skies update</p>",

By doing so, a maximum of 10 loaded minecarts would be possible, therefore limiting the possibility of abuse, while at the same time having the ability to send stuff along the rail tracks. Skilled players could get very creative with this dynamic, as this would enable the possibility for sending long range redstone signals as well.</p>\n<p>I am currently building a project with friends of mine, outside render/simulation distance of our main base. Sending building supllies from A to B is very exhausting since you need to hitch a ride every time you want to send stuff. Therefore the mechanic is already useable, but with a player character as \"dynamic chunk loader\", taking away the fun it could provide.</p>\n<p>I imagine a scenario where you are able to build a sort of redstone databus, which gives the command to auto load predefined items into a storage cart and have it return to the building site. Since this would surely require advanced expertise i do not see any balance issues. (at least none that are as op as the iron farm lol)</p>\n<p>All of the above is based on experience made on minecraft bedrock realms.</p>",

The current model of \"anywhere too far from the player is totally frozen\" really limits our creativity in making automated builds that are actually useful. At least for me, this is a major hurdle to playing Minecraft to my best enjoyment, since my playstyle consists in going on adventures far away and returning to my base.</p>\n<p>Ideally, this would be some kind of generalized solution that doesn't require hacky chunk loader blocks (like in mods) or just simulating everything, which would obviously be too slow. As a starting point, it could be made so that blocks that have been seen by the player from up close which would reasonably be expected to do something while far away (EG crops that grow, minecarts that move) are added to a separate simulation list and simulated individually (rather than with their entire chunk, to save on resources). When the chunk the block is in is re-entered, its state is updated to whatever it is supposed to be. This would also apply across dimensions.</p>",
