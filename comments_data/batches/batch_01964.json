You can still tap on mobs to hurt them as normal, but if you tap on the button twice like you do to the sneak button, the sword slash system will be activated. You tap on mobs as well to slash them. Those are a lot of things for a combat system for Bedrock, but still very useful!</p>",

Here is the post I tried to post for reference (basically my approach/idea):</p>\n<p>If a resource pack would have the ability to toggle between different textures or even turn of some textures, without deleting or moving the files, that would be great.</p>\n<p>There would be a new menu that you can access through clicking \"Menu\" beneath the resource pack you want to change the settings for (if that pack supports it). It grants you access to some on/off toggles that are defined in a json file in the pack, something like \"pack_options.json\". There would be written if something is on or off, just like the Minecraft options.json file works.</p>\n<p>In the pack would be also another file where is defined which option turns on/off or switches textures. It would be a list with variables and after that the path to the textures that are used if it is on/off, if it is empty, it uses the vanilla textures. There can be multiple block textures defined for one option.</p>\n<p>If asked, I can write some examples, if needed.</p>",
