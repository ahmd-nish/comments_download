The point of a turtle shell is that you can breathe longer underwater, but that you're sacrificing some of the protection you could have if you used something else.

I likewise think that being invulnerable to fire with netherite armor might be too powerful as well.

But that also has issues because it now has to save the world twice. Once on the backup copy and once on the current copy. Then when you \"die\" it has to reupload the backup onto the current.
