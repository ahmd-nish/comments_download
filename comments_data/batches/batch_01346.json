I can’t recall where I heard it before, but I think in some mojang interview they mention that elder guardians were designed so that people couldn’t just mine into the ocean monument to take its loot, perhaps one solution to this could be to have elder variants for every elemental which could give this mining fatigue effect to players in structures where these elders spawn— ocean monument or new ocean structure for elder guardians, nether fortresses or new elder blaze/hovering inferno themed mini-boss structure for the blazes, the trial chambers or perhaps some new airborne structure for the elder breeze, and eventually an earth based structure or mini-boss structure for the earth elemental mob.  These elder elementals could drop items important to rare weapon/tool crafting like the heavy core, trident prongs, or a flaming pickaxe head which could be used to auto-smelt mined items (just think this could be a cool way to introduce auto-smelting into the game, maybe new weapon would be more in line with other elemental trends we’ve seen so far.  I have no idea what tool, weapon, or charge would be used by earth elementals but I’m excited to hear what you guys have in mind! </p>",

It was disappointing that anyone would destroy someone else's hard work simply over a matter of taste....Truthfully though I've seen just as many if not more defending the wood.... Personally birch is one of my favorites, I love mixing it with dark oak or other super dark elements.</p>\n<p>Point is....just because you don't like it doesn't mean NO ONE, likes it.&nbsp; Maybe you just&nbsp; haven't learned how to incorporate it to look it's best😉&nbsp;</p>",
