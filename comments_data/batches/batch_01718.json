It may be piston a or it may be piston b. There is no consistency. It makes it impossibly to build redstone contraptions that handle several different variables.</p>\n<p>This bug can be extended to everything else involving redstone. Two pistons on the same line of redstone will activate in a random order, redstone repeaters set at the same delay may turn on connected lamps at different times, etc.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of sympathy for developers, but no matter how difficult this bug is to fix, it has to be fixed.

        "body": "<p>The chunk loader could be a new mob-type (like the adorable copper golem), that needs to be created and activated. It could move around and interact with the world to an extent, thus requiring that the player considers how to keep the golem situated where they need them. And once the number of active golems in the world exceeds the limit allowable, the oldest active golem in the world could shut down, like a machine that siezes and stops working. This would mean the player needs to keep tabs on golems. This type of chunk loader could open the way to have the golem as an ornamental piece (in it's new, inactive state and it's worn out, shut down state), the possibility of new items to create or even to upgrade the golem (to extend the chunk loader perhaps) or even mend a broken down golem to reactivate it.</p>\n<p>To be able to find a lost, active golem would present another potential for player problem-solving. Perhaps in a similar manner to how the tame dog can attack hostile mobs and eyes of ender can direct you to the location of the stronghold, dogs could also sniff out and direct the player in the correct direction for a moment to locate an active golem when you click on the dog with a piece used to create the golem.</p>\n<p>I think the use for chuck loaders in Bedrock is exciting alone, but the potential for the mechanics across the whole game could be something a lot more exciting as well. In a single-player world, I'm always looking at how I can create more interactions &amp; characters.</p>",

I am posting this here with great vitriol and disappointment. Please read it over though, the idea is solid.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">A Redstone Spike is a block that extrudes a spike when powered by redstone. It can be placed in any orientation like a piston. When fully extended the spike becomes a solid object preventing players and mobs from walking through.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">If the spike extends into a player or mob, they approach the tip of an extended spike, or jump on top, they will take 3 hearts of damage. If they become stuck in a spike, they will take 1 heart of damage each second they remain. The most effective trap uses an alternating current of redstone pulses to deal multiple lots of 3 damage.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">If a block stands in the way of the spike, the spike will not extend. Instead the the block will take damage equivalent to a swing with a stone pickaxe. If triggered with an alternating current of redstone pulses, the block will eventually break. If the block is mineable by a stone pickaxe, the block will fall to the ground as an item.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">It can be crafted using:</p>\n<table class=\"s90z9tc-19 iDFCDm\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"s90z9tc-20 eCOxQD\">\n<th class=\"s90z9tc-25 cmsMXn\">Cobblestone</th>\n<th class=\"s90z9tc-25 cmsMXn\">Nether Quartz</th>\n<th class=\"s90z9tc-25 cmsMXn\">Cobblestone</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr class=\"s90z9tc-20 eCOxQD\">\n<td class=\"s90z9tc-21 jruhvq\">Cobblestone</td>\n<td class=\"s90z9tc-21 jruhvq\">Blaze Rod</td>\n<td class=\"s90z9tc-21 jruhvq\">Cobblestone</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"s90z9tc-20 eCOxQD\">\n<td class=\"s90z9tc-21 jruhvq\">Cobblestone</td>\n<td class=\"s90z9tc-21 jruhvq\">Redstone Dust</td>\n<td class=\"s90z9tc-21 jruhvq\">Cobblestone</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">Although Nether Quartz is light related and a Blaze Rod grinds into dust, I chose them because they go together thematically and because I wanted to prevent access to the tool until at least after exploring the Nether. I did not want to use iron, diamond or a sword in the recipe because they each suggest a power greater than a stone pickaxe and as&nbsp;<a class=\"s90z9tc-27 gyTKyw\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/u/Dinnerbone\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">/u/Dinnerbone</a>&nbsp;has said, he does not want to fully automate the game.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">I believe this design will elegantly compliment the current collection of redstone tools and just fit into the game as if it was always there. Let us know if you have wanted something like this in the game for a long time. Let us know if you disagree with the design choices in any way.</p>",

If Tekkit was compatible with the latest versions of vanilla Minecraft, I would never play vanilla Minecraft.</p>\n\n<p>I think generators would have to power something other than redstone circuitry. In real logic circuits, every transistor has to be individually powered, otherwise something like a NOT gate could never output voltage. The circuit would be broken as soon as a gate/transistor output zero and every subsequent transistor would do nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, a logic circuit isn't a circuit in the more ordinary sense of an unbroken conductive path. Electrons don't enter a logic circuit at the beginning and wind their way to the end. Power enters and exits a logic circuit at innumerable points.</p>\n\n<p>Requiring the player to hook power up to every single redstone logic gate to mimick real-world logic circuits would be impossible. However, if redstone signals were treated as signals rather than a source of power, then things like pistons would need a separate source of power to give them the actual energy they need to move blocks. The redstone circuitry would control when a piston is extended and retracted, but would not provide the power to actually do the extending and retracting.</p>",

They would need a redstone signal from a new block called a converter which is half a white slab with a red dot (similar to a repeater or comparitor) and half Cog.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cogs also have a signal strengths like redstone but its cut in half from 16 to 8 (you can tell the strength by its speed or red dot on converter). This is going off the logic that more power is needed to move a larger chain of cogs. Any signal strength coming from a redstone line will be divided by 2 and if dividing the strength is less than one then nothing will happen.</p>\n<p>The converter can both take in and put out redstone signals to the cogs. If two converters put in two seperate redstone signals into the same chain of cogs then the whole line of cogs will stop moving entirely since they got jammed. The line of cogs will also stop moving if at least one cog isn't moving due to a lack of signal strength.</p>\n<p>Two converters could possibly be placed gear-to-gear so that redstone signals can be instantly be cut in half. Cogs could also be water logged and blast resistant.</p>",

Neither of these require lots of building or stacks of iron to use while being faster and if you want even more speed, you can build an ice road and get 40m/s.

        "body": "<p>I think since copper is more abundant than iron, it should have some niche usage instead of faster transfer rates as that would make current hoppers useless. My idea personally would be to make it drain items from the largest stack in the inventory above it rather than the first one. So if you had a chest with 10 dirt in the first slot and 30 cobble in the second, it would take the cobble first, then once it reached 10, they would alternate. I think this could allow for some unique redstone opportunities, especially in sorting systems with the new copper golem. Also since these would be easier to get than regular hoppers, they could maybe even have a slower item transfer rate to keep regular hoppers in play, while providing a cheap alternative for early game.</p>",

The new copper chest + 1 Iron Ingot = copper hopper.</p>\n<p>It lowers the overall material cost of the traditional hoppers, and it could oxidize, changing the speed at which it moves items. The biggest reason to do this is to support the new golems and their statue state. If you want a lot of statues, you'll also get a lot of copper chests, and placing too many chest could interfere with golem productivity.</p>",
