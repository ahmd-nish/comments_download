If you discover a new way to make addons you should want to share it with the community so better quality addons begin popping up. Encrypting the code would ruin the community. I’m sorry. I see where your coming from. But the fact of the matter is, the Minecraft addon community thrives off of being able to learn from each other.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I have a perfect example of why this would not be as great as you might think. Take the dragon addons floating around the community, for instance. Right now they’re a bit lackluster due to not manny knowing how to make a controllable land to air mob. However! There is an addon that exists on the market place who’s creators figured it out. Unfortunately, due to all marketplace maps being encrypted, no one is able to learn the mechanics used to make that happen. It doesn’t help that those addons are tied to the maps they come with due to this encryption. Meaning you are stuck using one of the best dragon addons on a specific map and will never see it on your custom world. </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I understand you don’t want your work republished but I never want to see that specific solution ever enter the community. You own rights to the addon itself, you “do not” own the common code used to make your addon work. That will forever be owned by the devs. (You have rights over the LEGO creation not rights to the specific bricks used in building it)</span></p>",

If so, it may discourage those who actually made this add-on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My advice is that add a function which allow add-on maker to make a decision whether the add-on would be encrypted. It is easy to do so, there would be a specified private key inside minecraft application while publish the public key. Add-on makers can encrypt their pack with the public key and publish it,&nbsp; after the encrypted pack imported in minecraft,&nbsp; minecraft decrypt it automatically with the private key.</p>",

It is a lil bit strange to harvest apples from the oak tree. \n<br />There would be an apple tree.</p>\n\n<p>We can get apples from chests and trading villagers. If we already have an apple, we could turn it to apple seeds. And it would be grow to an apple tree what gives us fruits every week. </p>\n\n<p>The other idea is a Titan.\n<br />It would be a power golem. \n<br />We could summon it from 4 diamond blocks and a wither skeleton head. (Blue color, black head, red eyes)\n<br />It would be the double power of the iron golem.\n<br />When we summon it in a village, we could trade with the villagers half price untill it protects the village (the die of the titan).\n<br />After his dead it could drop a diamond and a blue flower.</p>\n\n<p>My third idea is a working pirate ship.</p>\n\n<p>It could be summon on specific location on the see (for example when it is full moon.)\n<br />With pillagers crew, and more chests than a shipwreck. (Diamond, armors, etc).</p>\n\n<p>It would be on the ocean only a night, and it would disapper on the morning.</p>\n\n<p>We can find the location of the pirate ships on maps (from chest or trading with the cartographer).</p>\n\n<p>I think this would be great, quiet easy to put it to the game, and it don't mess the gameplay at all.</p>",

There is a boss, that spawns with end crystal in the specific obsidian. For the first time there I four bedrock in specific slots,  but when the player kills the boss, the experience points will take you to lvl 5. Also it drops 8 bedrock block, so you can place four still on that slots, place end crystal in the obsidian and resoawn that boss. Its name is Super Golem, that has 600hp and deals 100hp damage. He has four kinds of attacks: he can jump on 4 blocks with damage 100hp, he can throw bedrock blocks ranged attack, with 100hp damage, he can attack you in melee combat with three punches, each one deals 100hp, and he can dash right through you and you friends, and dashing is on 6 blocks long, 3 blocks wide and 4 blocks high, and deals 100hp. The boss's sizes are: hight - 3 blocks, wide - 3 blocks, and ,,long\" - three blocks. So he has square wide and long. Oh, yeah, players can't win against him that powerful. Well, they can use strategy, with which they must trap themselves with a little gap, and place water pitfall at the outside of that gapped wall. In that dimension, like beds explode in end and nether, water is poisonous, and takes lots of damage. So the boss will fall in, you attack with gap, so it can't reach you and water does extra damage role. So you can beat it with this strategy. \n<br />That dimension is like a stronghold - a maze</p>",

We’ve got horses in the plains, but not as many prey animals up in the mountains other than the basics like cows and goats. I think it would add a great diversity to the game, and maybe they could be rideable for baby villagers? Theres lots of types of mountain ponies, i think shetlands or fjords would be a good generic breed and I think they would be a perfect addition for the meadows up in the mountains or the rocky island hills. </p>\n\n<p>I think adding dead trees to the game would be really great for the natural vibe of the game, just like a few dead trees in some of the forest here and there, or dying ones, because that’s how it would work in an actual forest. </p>",

I just have a few suggestions for adding mobs in different biomes, e.g, the jungle biome already has tropical parrots and ocelots and Pandas but what if there were various types of tropical birds such as toucans? Similar to how we have several different species of tropical fish, we could also have tropical birds? Maybe tigers or Lions? The ice biome could possibly have a yeti? Maybe…scorpions or rattlesnakes in the desert? Some tumbleweeds? Another suggestion would be more forest creatures, hedgehogs, squirrels, ladybugs, butterflies, dragon flies, beetles, caterpillars, deer, bears, skunks, mice, raccoons, flying squirrels? These are just some future developing suggestions and would like to see some of these in game. Thank you for reading! (:\n</p>",

Start at 9 end at 18, you could also add armor for more protection in the upgrade table (iron diamond up to netherite) but it is always going to be less than the chest plate and have durability granted you could put mending on it which is why it has to and would be less than a shulker.</p>",

The trade-off for a chest / double-chest worth of storage is less armor / protection in a similar method the elytra trades protection for flight. A player should be able to click on it the backpack in their hand to open it and expand their storage, or if possible add a button map to open the backpack while wearing it.</p>\n<p>Don't get me wrong, the Shulker-Boxes / Ender Chest combo is great, but it's very much and end-game form of storage expansion. A major drawback is that you have to place down your Ender Chest, open it up and take out a Shulker-Box, and then place down the Shulker-Box to open it up and access that inventory. This is a fine trade-off for a large amount of storage created by this system I think, but it isn't feasible early or mid game prior to the player reaching the end. And for those of us who just want extra storage to carry / collect more stuff it doesn't work.</p>\n<p>Bundles are a great step forward I think, but the drawback is they only hold a random assortment of 64 items. Again, this is a great addition to storage, especially for the early game or when you're exploring. But this doesn't help when your collecting resources or mining and have stacks upon stacks of stuff, which is where backpacks would come in handy for early / mid game as extra storage.</p>",
