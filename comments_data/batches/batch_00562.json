Chorus fruits specialty is that it gives you food resource and it teleports you randomly, this is very effective if you are trapped. I dont see a point making it to potion when potions cant be sttacked into 64 items like chorus fruit does. That would be dissadventige for players. I'm just saying it is pointelss having it in game if its not better than the chorus fruit. \n<br />But if you could think more of it, maybe you would get better idea. Like eating chorus fruit is slow, if you throw potion it is way faster Ánd if you throw it on other player, mob or entity it would teleport them, this would be perfect because you could teleport creeper and he would explode some where else. The downside is it will be randomly. Really just think more of it and you will get better idea for it :). Me too, I just think about some idea and want to write it here I have 3 now. The good instructions are: What it can benefit you as a player having this feature.\n<br />This feature cant be that overpowered. \n<br />Make it unique, not just another list of items or mobs that don't do anything special.</p>",

You could teleport them, disorient, or put them in a dangerous situation. The uses for drinkable could be a bit further range of teleportation than chorus fruit by itself, allowing better teleportation into secret bunkers without having to update the chorus fruit itself.\n<br />The potion would be a great escape when surrounded by monsters and low health. Throw it down as splash, and travel a good distance away to safety! \n<br />The lingering version of this could be more like a portal in some ways.</p>",

Below you will find a transcription of the topic being discussed. <br><br>Title: “New mineral for the End: Corrupted Platinum” <br><br>Text: “It would have a color equal to rose gold and when mining it it would give us a small nugget that when putting 9 together would give us an ingot that in turn you would have to put it on the blacksmith table with a diamond tool or armor (the fortune enchantment would not affect it, it would always give a nugget) this metal would give us several qualities, the first would be not to die from a vacuum since when falling it would teleport us to a nearby island, this ability would depend on how many pieces of armor you wear, The more you have, the greater the teleportation range and any item with this metal would be immune to vacuum, the second ability would consist of teleporting the enemies a few blocks away from us when they hit us as a defense method, it would also depend on how many pieces of armor we have to have a greater or lesser effect, in addition to giving us more durability, attack damage and protection.”</p>\n<p>- Translated by Admin</p>",
