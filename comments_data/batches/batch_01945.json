After right clicking on the table, it pulls up a large set of design options; including a slot for paper, a slot for dye, a text button, and a lot of image buttons. To the right would be a display of your poster, where you can adjust position for your content. When each item is where you want it, hit the stamp button.</p>\n<p>A press machine could also be built, allowing you to copy that poster. Then posters can be plastered all over the world!

In them the player will be able to put various items, as well as seal the jug. After this, the jug can only be opened by breaking it. Thus, the jugs can be carried in the inventory in a sealed state. They will serve as a “sealed gift” or a kind of “case”. You can also add more drawings of jugs of varying degrees of rarity. This motivates people to collect jugs!</p>",

        "body": "<p>Some super cool ideas here! On the topic of storing things in pots, I have some other ideas.<br><br>Perhaps, as well as liquids, a couple stacks of a dust item like sugar, redstone, blaze powder, and gunpowder, and maybe even blocks like sand, concrete powder and gravel could be stored? Edit: I also forgot to mention, these would be interacted with similarly to the cauldron, only with stacks of items rather than bottles/buckets of water. Just makes them a little more interesting than a regular inventory UI like others have suggested.<br><br>There could also be some special behaviour depending on the items stored: for pots which have gunpowder stored, they could explode when mined with tools or shot with a radius and power proportional to the amount of gunpowder inside. For pots that have a bucket of water, adding sand could perhaps make balls of clay which can only be accessed by breaking the pot. For pots which store blaze powder, they could set fire to the surroundings when mined or shot.<br><br>I do also like your idea of pots keeping their stored water when picked up, which could also extend to these dust items, almost like a primitive form of Shulker Box. Their relative lack of rarity would of course be balanced by only being able to store two or three stacks of an item instead of 27, and the limited item types which can be stored.</p>",
