Heck, I didn't even know this was a thing until right now! I'm already learning! And in response to CreeperDoge75, it does too fit in minecraft! Believe me, there are things that don't fit, but this isn't one of them. This would be a fantastic and educational addition to minecraft, and the chocolate dirt (Is that what it's called? Can we call it that?) would be a great addition with it's weather detecting properties. Just now, I thought of a mechanism that uses observers to detect when it rains using the chocolate dirt, and then pushes lightning rods up to the roof, for when people don't want to see a lightning rod on the roof but also don't want their creation destroyed by lightning. I'm sure there are more applications too! And maybe, just for fun, they could have a small chance of dropping cocoa beans when you dig the dirt. Maybe? Maybe not. Never mind, that's probably too weird. But yes! I agree with this biome wholeheartedly!</p>",
