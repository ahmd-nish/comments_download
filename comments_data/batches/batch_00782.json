Iron has become so hard to find im resorting to finding villages with black smiths or killing the iron golems which wss something i wouldnt have to do before. Gold, diamonds, redstone, and lapace have also become harder to find even in caves the most youll find in veins is 1-3 for redstone gold and lapace diamonds have become more rare then before. of course this is all in the actual caves where diamonds have decreased when in the open and exposed to air blocks but while strip mining i went through so many pickaxes that i gave up without even going to the nether because of lack of resources. increasing the ore generation for iron and diamonds would be very helpful as well as spawning iron veins higher in the world like before .</p>",

Why would anybody ever hate the new caves when literally most of the community was wildly asking for a full update to the cave systems. As far as what I've seen, most people (70%) are very satisfied with the new cave generation (about 15% want it bigger). It's not even replacing any of the old caves; the old caves still exist, they're just bigger and they blend better with the environment, so they're just improved. A toggle for certain update features is not something they've ever agreed on implementing, because then everyone's experience would be so wildly inconsistent and confusing. You should still find a lot of the old caves. I don't know why anyone on this Earth would want them, though. Everyone love's nostalgia, but you definitely need to be progressive. Old things in Minecraft exist along with new features, yet there are quite a few people who just stuck themselves in older versions, and it's not because new features are bad or are replacing old features, it's because they just want to stay where they always were. Any spectator who looks at the latest updates will tell you they made Minecraft progressively better, yet some people wouldn't like that because anything that is new for them just doesn't fit into Minecraft. If that's the case, then just explore as many chunks as you can, and you shouldn't come across any of the new caves.</p>",

Decreased air exposure is more of an interesting mechanic because it doesn't apply to aquifers, which are very common, so now there are advantages to exploring in aquifers. It doesn't actually buff regular strip mining that much at all, because if you're only making a tunnel, you'll cover a very small area in a given amount of time compared to the areas you could cover through caving within the same time, so it's much better to explore than just endlessly mine a tunnel. This combined with the huge Diamond veins definitely encourages players to explore a lot. You now might really want to use TNT to clear away huge chunks of Stone/Deepslate and be able to cover unexposed ores quickly, which can be pretty fun, so now there are new methods for strip mining that weren't very useful before. Also, Iron and Lapis don't have reduced air exposure. You can find the most Iron underground at level Y-16 and the most Lapis at Y-0. You can find as much Iron and Lapis as you're used to at these levels (even more because of the huge caves). Check the Minecraft Wiki Caves &amp; Cliffs page to get the exact details.</p>",
