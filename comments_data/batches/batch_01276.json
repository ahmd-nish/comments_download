If this feature does not get added, at the very least it would be nice for Java Minecraft to have some sort of controller support so your arms and hands do not get tired using a desktop keyboard for extended periods of time.

The problem is that this launcher is using a nightly version of LWJGL 2.9.4. This is from 2015, and the nightly servers for LJGWL version 2 are down, meaning you can only get versions 2.9.3 and earlier, and of course version 3 and later on a newer website. Not only that, but LJGWL only recently (September 2019) released binaries for arm32 and arm64 on Linux, in version 3.2.3 (the newest stable build as of writing). Since LJGWL changed so much, these are completely incompatible. I honestly don't even know how the script writer got arm32 versions of 2.9.4 .so files for the rpi. I'll have to look into where the files came from (the scripts connect to Dropbox addresses) and see if I can either get arm64 versions (for newer android devices), or force Minecraft to use a newer version of LJGWL even with the old launcher.</p>\n\n<p>But that'll be work for another day.</p>",

Large Servers that have most of the issues already have moderation, and private ones don't need it. And knowing that they probably won't have humans as moderators forever and eventually will automate, as has every other company and server, this spells disaster. It is such a stupid idea for such a game. And they have had so many years since Minecraft has had a multiplayer feature, and only now you decide to add a moderation system after your merged with Microsoft? It won't work. To those in Microsoft that are reading this, Minecraft isn't a social platform like Xbox Live. Universal bans might work there, but they for sure won't work here, especially without appeals. The new migration to a new account is a good idea, but this is a turn in the wrong direction.</p>",

The exclusivity deal really makes the whole \"Better together\" idea kinda distorted. Not really playing together when I can only play Minecraft VR using a custom made mod for the java eddition. Really love the VR support in Bedrock from when I had Oculus, but I didn't let that effect my decision to sell it and upgrade to a completely steam vr friendly headset.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The reason steam vr works so well is because it is made with the intent of giving people open access to VR no matter which headset you use. It allows developers to easily accommodate wide ranges of headset with little work to individually tune the game for each one (But as we saw with fallout 4 vr, things can be made to not work for a specific headset even in SteamVR). To see Minecraft Bedrock add SteamVR support would be a bright day in my books, and I keep checking the internet every few months to see. This is a suggestion I fully support.</p>",

It disincentivizes people from upgrading and/or playing if the experience is sub-par. Mojang: don't wait; get an optimized version out for the people and fine-tune it later.

It’s not fair because I couldn’t have gotten Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition while it was available because I didn’t have a Nintendo Switch at the time. And now, my worlds are stuck on Minecraft: Wii U Edition forever. How come when they were planning on releasing the Bedrock Version, they didn’t have a second thought about last gen players that can’t afford to buy new consoles. I have a Nintendo Switch now, and have gotten it last year, but I still cannot transfer worlds because the old version was removed from the store. If you’re reading this Mojang, Microsoft, or 4J, please do something about it. I don’t care too much about updating it because I have the Bedrock Version and can use that for updates, but I just want you to either bring back Minecraft: Nintendo Switch Edition or find a possible way to transfer worlds directly from Wii U to Switch Bedrock without having the old version</p>",

Update 1.22 could be a less intense and reduced update and could be released at the end of 2024 - beginning of 2025, this update would be the TRADE REBALANCING UPDATE focused on updating and rebalancing villager trades and the possible implementation of new types from Mangrove, Mountain, Cherry Tree villages or even in bamboo areas with the new wood. Apart from this, some errors would be solved.</p>\n<p>From this update until summer 2025, 1.23, the MOBS REBIRTH UPDATE, would be released, another very small update which would add some of the losing mobs from old mob votes, including their mechanics. The most important thing about this update 1.23 is that it would focus on correcting the reported bugs and rendering the game to the maximum and improving the code as much as possible.</p>\n<p>Finally, in Minecraft live in 2025, for update 1.24 you could present an ambitious but possible project because you were working on the plan for the second year before and having improved the rendering of the game and code. the END UPDATE focused on improving the end as you see fit.</p>\n<p>In short, in three updates you would add things that would help the popularity of the game since they are things that the community has been asking for for many years and would give them great joy.</p>\n<p>All of these are just ideas, my intention is neither to force nor to guess the future.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>",

        "body": "<p>Honestly, it feels like lately a lot of the changes have just been like adding an extra block, decoration, or mob variant. I think what they really need to do in the next update is make a lot of the mechanics more solid. They need to decide how they want villager trading to actually work. They also need to pay attention to late game and item farms. I think how the game works now it really interesting with the way all the item farms work, but they need to make it more intuitive, and if they continue to produce the game where players need to google how to build any given farm, they should provide official information on it. I also think they need to improve redstone and make more resources in order for new people coming in. Lastly, they need to fix the progression. Enchanting is broken, and there's almost no point to iron armor because of how easy it's become to get diamonds in mass. I think they need to really spread things out and make it a gradual grind to the top, perhaps making diamonds rarer or giving alternative reasons to use iron tools until really late game.</p>\n<p>To summarize, I think they need to take all the current systems and format them all similarly so that it's easier for any new player to pick up. I also think they need to fix progression and make exploring less dangerous and more fundamental to the new progression. Looking back, I think they did a really good job with the smithing upgrade template, but I feel like it's not represented in the rest of the game.</p>",

About the redesigns since they said it would be live action they would probably make the monsters and other mobs look less nightmarish uncanny realistic and make the style look like the Warner Animation Group movies like Storks or Smallfoot where they have a cartoony style. And since it takes place in a blocky world I think they would make the blocks not look realistic and more like Minecraft. I guess you could say in the style of the lego movies. And speaking of the lego movies they should use live action sequences similar to those movies where whenever they play Minecraft it shows the perspective of the player in a cartoony animation style and when it zooms out it shows the live action perspective of the humans playing Minecraft. That sounds like a great idea honestly. Though it might get compared to Free Guy and be called Free Guy but animated but I don’t care. The same concept doesn’t mean the same movie.</p>",
