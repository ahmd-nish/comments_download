An Ender Chest takes some work making more than one takes quite a bit of work. Making a whole network of them takes a lot of work. Especially before you go to the end. What if this “sharing is caring” chest became a deep dark chest? Made only out of materials you can get from the deep dark? Such as four of the blocks that spread as they gather experience and 4 of the screaming blocks combine, then you have to add them to a shucker box. That makes a deep dark chest. Then every deep dark chest screams every time one is opened so everyone knows something is being taken from the shared chest. But you can put something in it in the overworld and it shows up in every other deep dark chest in any other place within the realm but only one chest can be open at a time. </p>",

And this slot could be in competition for other back additions like capes, or backpacks to encourage style and strategy. Now, as arrows can be pulled from inventory (in java at least) I think a quiver should at least act like a bundled allowing a random draw of tipped arrows making up the stack it holds. This would be helping with inventory management issues and adding some fun mechanics. I'm not sure why it needs the function to increase reload speed, but I do like the idea of making a specialized slot for holding for more arrows, and even allowing mixed arrow types to stack.</p>",
