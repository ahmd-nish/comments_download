It is a great idea to make arrows have a lifespan like swords do and the like, and since arrows stick onto the opponent, it would seem reasonable to retrieve the arrows after the mob has died. Sharpening the arrows, if applied, should have a cost, or else it would be too powerful as an update. Whether it is adding materials and/ or weakening arrows each sharpen, there should be some kind of way to make reusing them more realistic. In the current game, you basically have to farm chickens for feathers, and mine heaps of gravel over and over till they all are flint, or make a skeleton farm. Either that, or you spend hours getting and putting the infinity enchantment onto your bow. This difficulty, to me, is unrealistically unresourceful to make arrows break after one successful hit, and is just as difficult. </p>",
