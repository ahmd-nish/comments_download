I am quite used to the way ores and stones generate in Minecraft and I have no problem with it.</p>\n<p>And yet, no the other hand, I really like your ideas for some reason. Allow me to first say that your writing is excellent and I appreciate the way you tried to address all possible impacts of your ideas rather than just tossing out two sentences without a thought as to their ramifications upon the rest of the game. Second, you seem to be bothered by the fact that unless you are specifically seeking them out for building, stone variants are useless from a mining perspective. This desire to want most everything in Minecraft to have its purpose is&nbsp;what has driven me to share quite a few ideas myself on this site. Shameless plug: check them out. I think you might like them.</p>\n<p>Now to actually address your ideas: you've somehow convinced me that this wacky idea could actually work. I don't want to comment on textures until we see JAPPA's final product, and I don't really care about your idea's effects on modded play. But I have to say, your proposition to have ore veins span across more than one stone variant is particularly tantalizing to me from an aesthetics point of view. At the end of the day you're proposing a relatively simple change that would&nbsp;look great and not break the game's balance. This is the kind of well thought-out idea that should be getting lots of attention here on this site. You have more than earned my vote!</p>",

I believe the current textures should become the 'rough' ones, as they do not look all too smooth as for currently. Another 'smooth' texture should be added, which would be used to create polished blocks, similarly to stone and stone bricks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Something you didn't mention in the post, however, is specific stones for each biome. I believe this would have to happen in a major cave update, which has been highly requested. Some things proposed for that are ice caves, which would also completely change the vibe of caves in general, which would help this to blend in. But like I said, this would probably be in with a major cave update as randomly doing this would jar a lot of players.</p>\n<p>I would also recommend putting the 'to summarize' bit at the top as to not deter any readers with a wall of text.</p>\n<p>I really want this suggestion to happen.</p>",

For instance: a stone pickaxe requires 3 stone, so to upgrade it to an iron pick, you need to obtain 3 iron ingots to upgrade it to an iron pick. If you want to upgrade an iron sword to a gold sword, you would need two gold ingots in the smithing table to upgrade it. The one exception would be Diamond to Netherite due to how rare netherite is. With this change in mind, I think it would be best if the smithing table requires experience levels to upgrade if and only if the tool has enchantments on it.</p>",

Just because GameTheory makes a theory, doesn't mean it is automatically true and that is canon. It is only a guess what may be true. Who know's, maybe it could mean nothing at all. So it isn't really fair to say something should do something because of a theory MatPat had. All though it seems tight and makes sense, in the end it is just a theory. A GAME THEORY (sorry lmao) Plus look how many times he has re-written the fnaf story line. I'm not saying you can't or shouldn't believe it, I am saying you should be aware that it isn't confirmed or 100% true.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div class=\"comment-meta\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"comment-meta\"><span title=\"TheKiwiMango5\">But in relation to this I agree with Kiwi it should only drop a saddle, due to being able to ride a Ravager is way to powerful.

Say you had a giant sorting machine and a large chest full of items to sort. The netherite hopper could drain it in less than a quarter the time as a regular hopper. Like other netherite, it would be immune to lava. It would have 10 slots instead of the usual 5. It could be made with a netherite ingot surrounded by hoppers and it gives you 8 netherite hoppers.</p>",

The only difference was that i was thinking a netherite hopper would be blast proof and a gold hopper would be almost as fast as a hopper minecart. Might add a leather hopper that is slower but when water logged would have expanded capacity. Basically all the armor types would have a hopper with a different effect. not sure on Diamond though.</p>",

But wouldn't an ice sword +2 sound awesome to freeze a zombie in place? Combine ice cube block with ancient debris and you get 'ice dust' or something, which you could apply to a sword to upgrade it.
