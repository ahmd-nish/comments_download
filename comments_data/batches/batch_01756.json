Having different slope intensities as well as maybe making a Minecart hang on a chain, that slides down a zipline type of rail. More rail variety: Rails that teleport you to another rail in a max distance of 16 blocks or so, that one is craftet with an enderperle. Broken rails, for visual, but maybe even rails that just brake your minecart while you fly further and if you land on a special minecart you enter it automatically, if you fall on it.</p>\n<p>Allowing the placement of rails on walls to have 90° drops or to be able to build a loop with it.</p>\n<p>All these options would also give a lot of new possibilities for decoration.</p>\n<p>Minecarts that hang from the ceiling and you can attach a chain or piston to it to pick up blocks from underneath, this would give complete new possibilities of transporting stuff.</p>\n<p>Adding a slime cube to a minecart to be able to attach more blocks to it that drive around.</p>\n<p>So many possibilities.</p>",

Thus, a redstone torch can feed a row of 15 redstone powders, in a row of <strong>enriched redstone powder the torch would have the ability to energize more than 15 powders away</strong>, perhaps doubling to 30 (the definition of this new value, I believe , be closely linked to programming challenges).</p>\n<p>this is very interesting because, in addition to reducing the use of signal repeaters it also allows for a more accurate use of comparators, since, with a greater amount of signal intensities the comparator can show more nuances with the enriched redstone than it would be possible to do with normal redstone. I already have ideas for this new feature.</p>\n<p>suggestion for its manufacture in the Inventory's \"Crafting Table\":<br>two restone powder plus two copper nuggets would form two enriched redstone powder.</p>\n</section>",

When lighting strikes it would then create lightning in a bottle and drop the item. Maybe there could be a chance of destroying the bottle. This should be possible to automate using dispensers.</p>\n\n<p>The lighting in a bottle should be used by right clicking on a lightning rod. It would then send lightning to a mob or other lightning rod in the vicinity. Just normal lightning, I'd say in a 16 wide sphere. This should also be possible using a dispenser. After use the lightning in a bottle should just leave the bottle.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively you could also surround an empty bottle with iron nuggets to create a leyden jar that can be transformed into an charged leyden jar using a lightning rod in the same way. But I like the mystical feel of the lightning in a bottle more. </p>",
