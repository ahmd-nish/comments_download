I think this behavior would make a world more lively and would bring more opportunities to world development. Of course this behavior might not always be wanted but this could be made optional and specific to circumstances that would be ideal.

They check all the many different dark oak biomes and only spawn when it meets all the parameters. So, if this were to be implemented, it would have to have minimal parameters, and it may cause crashes, like if you were to put a jungle tree in a spruce tree biome. That would confuse the computer like crazy, so a little more thought may have to be put into this, but hey, good idea, and keep it up! ;)</p>",
