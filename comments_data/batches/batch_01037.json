The only solution is to buy a new Minecraft account which is outrageous.</p>\n<p>I swear if this gets added the masses will revolt. The debate over the 1.9 combat changes will look like a friendly discussion compared to the public outcry that will be caused by this system. Microsoft is trying to execute order 66 on everyone's childhood and I will not stand for it. Minecraft has been ultra-lazy anyway. Hundreds of bugs on bedrock? Mojang just says they will do nothing to fix it. Have great concept art of the new update with exciting new features? LET'S NOT ADD THEM. Even this website is becoming more useless because they stick their heads on the mud and ignore most criticisms and suggestions.</p>\n<p>Notch should have held on to Minecraft and kept things the way they were. Microsoft, in their endless efforts to make more money and baby proof the game is absolutely soiling it for the vast majority of the player base.
