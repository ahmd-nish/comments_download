And the climbing walls idea could be either with a potion OR while its equipped, being able to climb 2 blocks or even 3 at max, like ladders.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>The Armadillo</strong></p>\n<p>- It's scute could be also applied to shields, and of course, this \"projectile negation\" property should also work with wolves' armor! And maybe, it could give inmunity to the berry bushes' spikes, bc its kind of flat and compact, avoiding little things to get through?<br><br><strong>The Penguin</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-&nbsp;</strong>While holding a fish, penguins should follow you.<br>- As they walk over land, they could make blocks slippery temporarily (They're a little clumsy, so they could leave traces of iced water?); if honey wax is applied, the floor will stay slippery. This could help boats to travel faster by land (like Tiny Jebs did on the Armadillo introduction) or giving more speed with the Frost Walker enchantment (similar to Soul Speed)</p>",
