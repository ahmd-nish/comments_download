If any blocks get added in the end update, itll probably be like a special kind of endstone or something nothing more. <br>Its kinda irritating not gonna lie. <br>I dont work for minecraft, however I am a programmer, so I understand some of this. However, I do believe that there is nothing wrong with straying from the theme-I do it all the time. But it is also frustrating when you give ppl what they want in a game or mod, and it may or may not be directly related, but one person is happy- the other person is hating on you bc its 'not related to the update' but thats another topic-for another time. I do agree with you, but I am saying 'dont get ur hopes up' bc I dont know if it will actually happen</p>",
