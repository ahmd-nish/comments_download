Mojang has been moving to be quite progressive lately. From supporting Black Lives Matter to denying adding sharks because they would \"encourage killing sharks\", they are trying to make Minecraft more and more \"political correct\".<br><br>Moving away from politics, I don't really think it's a good thing to keep adding new drop mechanics to every mob. Not only does that make it harder for them to code new mobs into the game, but it makes things over complicated.<br><br>Look at turtles for example, you can get their shell and use it as helmet. The obvious/intuitive approach is to kill them and take their shell. Yet, they don't drop it when you do that, instead dropping a bunch of useless stuff. What you should do, is breed them so when the babies grow they drop \"scutes\" and then use these scutes to craft a turtle shell (???).</p>",
