The logic behind Copper deoxidizing when struck with lightning is that lightning burns the green patina. Also, not everything has to be scientifically accurate; you're playing a fantasy game. Lightning does a lot of crazy things. Having an entire item that is just there to deoxidize Copper doesn't really make sense. The Lightning mechanic is more of a fun alternative, the really functional method is scraping, and I think that scraping should be limited to the axe.</p>",

Waxing should protect it from random deoxidation, just as it protects the others from changing state in either direction.</p>\n\n<p>We all have different thresholds for suspension of disbelief, based on what we do for a living. As such I'm more sensitive to how electricity works than the average person. I'm willing to accept that I'm biased here, but if a different approach to the task is more intuitive it should at least be considered.</p>\n\n<p>@Ziad El-Moursy\n<br />True, lighting rods should be placed well away from metal roofs, lest your entire roof conduct the strike and do all the damage the rod is supposed to protect from.</p>\n\n<p>Burning off patina is nonsense, if that were the logic it should also be possible to deoxidize in a blast furnace. See above for my commentary on scientific accuracy. Lightning does a lot of crazy - let's say magical - things. Turning people into witches, summoning the 4 horsemen. Interacting with a block is a more mundane effect, the way lighting starts fires and deoxidizes should not be put in the same category as magical effects.</p>\n\n<p>My soot suggestion has far more than a single use.</p>\n\n<p>I disagree, all bladed tools should be capable of scraping. A hoe is the tool most shaped like a plane/scraper. Since axes \"scrape\" bark off trees it is a logical choice as well, but I don't think it should be the unique one.

The coal would just take up space, leaving less room for diamonds to spawn. Giving a player coal for killing a boss you aren't even supposed to kill would just be plain dumb. Even besides that, it's also a texture issue. Deep Slate (as its now called) is a very dark color, almost as dark as blackstone. The coal wouldn't pop out on the block, even if you were standing right next to it. If you wanted to add it into the Deep Dark as merely a collector's item, I suggest putting a \"Deep Slate Coal Ore\" in new generating chests or existing structures, like abandoned mineshafts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>(Mojang if you see this hire me)</p>",
