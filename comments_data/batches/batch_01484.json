        "body": "<p>I love this idea, it actually helps me because i was about to make my own post on cerberus. I saw from a youtuber about the new info lately from mojang asking what kind of fantasy mobs people would want in minecraft. This is just what i was going for. However, i would like to add to it a bit. I think it makes sense for this boss to be pretty big like the myths talk about and the pictures show. Lets say about 8 or 10 blocks high, maybe? Also, as for drops, i think it should drop meat from itself. There is good and bad things this meat can do. Again these are just ideas but if the meat is still raw then eating it will give bad effects such as wither and nausea, and if it is cooked then it can give effects such as healing and regeneration. It is sorta like rotten flesh and a golden apple in one because of these effects, lol. Anyways, you also said that the drop should be something useful, so how about adding the bosses collar? This collar can be put on in the helmet section of the armor but of course show on the neck of the skin somehow if someone wants to wear it. This collar will allow the player to summon his/her own black dogs as minion when fighting, that and/or the player can summon a smaller version of cerberus as a pet also for fighting or companionship, however, once done the player cannot wear it so the player will need to make a decision, well that, or just kill another cerberus, lol. I hope these ideas are helpful. Like i said you don't have to but you can use them and edit this post of yours. Hope it was helpful though.</p>",

If you wanted to go find a pillager captain to start a raid, you'd have to go looking - similar to how you go looking for ocean monuments and woodland mansions.
