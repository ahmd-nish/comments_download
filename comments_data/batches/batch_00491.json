        "body": "<p>Yes! It would make more sense for the books in the bookshelf to drop out when normally mining, while Silk touch could be used to pick up the bookshelf with it's books in it (obviously unstackable at that point). This use would be similar to a beehive which allows you to carry bees, and would provide more pre-ender dragon opportunities for inventory sorting, giving you an easier way to carry around all those enchantment books. This would also still have the idea of the regular bookshelf mechanics, but with more exciting options. It would also be great if a full chiselled bookshelf could count towards an enchanting table, which would give more options for an enchting setup, and \"blocking\" bookshelves to lower the max enchantment by a few levels (just take a book out instead of placing a torch or block). This mechanic would interestingly allow the use of chiselled bookshelves full of enchanted books to count towards the enchantment table, which could be interesting.</p>",
