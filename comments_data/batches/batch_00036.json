Example I seen this add on called No more grind it was a bunch of ore generators that can be crafted so you won't have to dig up half of the map it had 4.5 or 4.7 stars so I bought it. Mistake, it lead you to believe that this would make it easier than grinding for ore but nope in order for you ti build just one generator requires alot of grinding then you have a total of 9 upgrades all requiring a netherite smiting template which can only be found in the nether bastions and there is no guarantee of that. The insane amount of hours that you have to grind just to get one generator up and going to start produce a fairly good amount of ore can easily exceed the amount of time you spend in a mind grinding for resource ores. I think something minecraft should implement because of add ons like this they should implement a try before you buy allow people 1 hour of play time with their purchase after that it you will be prompted to either purchase it or delete it. Doing so would make creators more honest with their description because people won't buy it because they know what they are getting.</p>",
