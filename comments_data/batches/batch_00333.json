This feature would best be implemented if stars were randomly generated per each Minecraft seed. If not one player could just map out and post online a bunch of constellations that everyone would use. Two: Other than the beauty constellations would have, their only other function would be navigation (how they are used in the real world). However, with items like the locator map, compasses, etc. (all which would be acquired before a telescope), this method of navigation would be woefully outmatched. Three (and last): The actual method described to map out constellations is not exactly intuitive; it would need some work.</p>\n\n<p>I love the idea, it would definitely tie in with the lore themes brought by the archeology part of 1.17, but it ultimately needs rethinking if it were to be implemented. </p>",
