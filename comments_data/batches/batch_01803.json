(This is based on real life) The wood does not burn. The cones can fall naturally, and only turn into saplings when set on fire. They grow slowly, like real life, gradually taking longer before growing again. They will grow to a 1 x 1 tree in 3 daynight cycles, then 2 x 2 in an additional 5, 3 x 3 in 7, 4 x 4 in 9, 5 x 5 in 11, 6 x 6 in 13, 7 x 7 in 15, 8 x 8 in 17, 9 x 9 in 19, 10 x 10 in 21, 11 x 11 in 23, and then they will not grow anymore, meaning a full-sized tree takes 143 days to become that way. They will also increase height. Giant sequoias do not have vines dangling down. You can decide where a sequoia will grow by adding more saplings, in up to an 11 x 11 space, and when they grow they will turn to full size immediately. However, getting cones is risky. If you mine a sequoia wood, it has a chance to get you nothing, and you will get the achievement \"greedy logger\", as sequoias should not be chopped down. Sequoia groves spawn as a taiga or snowy taiga variant, with spruce and sequoia trees. You can bonemeal saplings, but not cones, and you cannot bonemeal full trees. If you blow up a sequoia with TNT, it will drop nothing.</p>",

Just makes people wanna explore the badlands more especially if it has a new boss or super cool treasures. Basically the underwater ruins and the ocean monument except for in the badlands, combined, and both changed to match the biome and have the new mobs/boss.

The Deep Dark feels set up for something more unsettling than just another boss gate\n<br />One of the strongest theories is that reinforced deepslate isn’t a portal frame, it’s a seal.\n<br />Sculk behaves less like a natural biome and more like bio-engineered technology: it reacts to sound, spreads from death, stores souls, and transmits signals. Even the mob guarding it isn’t called a boss ,it’s literally a Warden. That alone suggests containment, not treasure protection\n<br />The Ancient Cities feel more like fallen containment facilities than dungeons. The “portal” looks like a breach that was sealed after something went wrong\n<br />Imagine needing something truly dark and powerful to crack that seal and when you do, you don’t step into a new dimension. \n<br />A major boss is unleashed, Wardens begin spawning as the fight grows louder, and the battle becomes chaotic and terrifying. The boss could be massive or swarm-based — something that finally explains where sculk came from and ties the Deep Dark, the End, and the Nether together\n<br />After defeating it, instead of gaining permanent access like the Ender Dragon, you’re given the ability to re-seal the breach, unlocking the knowledge to craft reinforced deepslate yourself\n<br />My two pennies: not just a new dimension,\n<br />but a containment breach, a world-level threat, and the choice to seal it again.</p>",

You give me a basic wooden chair, that allows me to actually sit, and I will give you numerous builds utilizing it. Players have utilized minecarts and boats to get close to this, but it falls short and people dislike it. It's to the point where it is just annoying that being able to SIT isn't allowed. Yes, you can build \"chairs\"; they're not usable though. Creativity can be present in an items use as well, not just the item. Which is why not having a simple wooden chair is stifling people's creativity. Four legs, a back, and a seat; this is all that it needs to be...nothing more. Do this with each piece of wood, and the community will build. If you think of everyday objects that you use, a chair is high on the list.</p>",
