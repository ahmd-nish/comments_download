Maybe, instead, you'd make some new block using those Skulk blocks (like maybe Compact Skulk) and then light it normally using flint &amp; steel.<br><br>Maybe, on that same note, you might want to add something special found in those castle structures that might be worth the trouble of going into them. Since you're going with a sort of earthy/medieval theme with this, maybe add a special weapon to a specific room like a Hammer, which can't be crafted, that will deal MASSIVE damage and incredible knockback but attacks way slower than an axe. So the castles would be like End Cities in that manner, only your going in for a new weapon instead of an armor.</p>",
