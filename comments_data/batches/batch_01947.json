Are you guys going to really keep us apart like this? And cause me pain? :(<br><br>I have Steam set up and a decent fan-made control configuration... but navigating the menus to craft, sort, access chests/inventory etc is TORTURE on this type of control currently. So imprecise and maddening! I have to hold my breath to try and select something every time.<br><br>So this work-around is NOT AT ALL sufficient. :(<br><br>Please, give us proper controller support. Regular mouse/WASD type movement in normal mode... But then also, in the menus, the controller is put into a secondary function optimized to kind of snap to each square/button (by giving it a grid, basically), the way other games treat Menu controls vs gameplay controls. It CAN be done!<br><br>Please?

As a Server host myself I think I can speak for a lot of us when I say you should really add it so that custom servers can have their own news/activities/MOTD menu page on the side as well. I'm sure there would be concerns about people using it to perform inappropriate things like inappropriate images, words, etc. but just as any platform would have I'm certain you can easily set up restrictions and/or ways to report inappropriate activities. Doing this would definitely help you grow your online server community, so that people that aren't into downloading unnecessary apps and using a bunch of websites just to stay up to date with their favorite servers. I propose a way to do this is to either set it up through the bedrock dedicated server files you provide or find a way to do it through Minecraft bedrock itself, or possibly a better/easier/more organized way to do it would be to make a separate app just for customizing such parts of one's server (something like \"Minecraft BDS Menu Editor\" as like a title for the app).</p>",

        "body": "<p>I have 4 reasons for why this UI needs to be reworked and or made optional / removed entirely from Minecraft and to have the old UI back.</p>\n<p>1. The UI is confusing and has unnecessary upselling.<br>The UI is confusing because when I want to create a new world, I want to create a new world, I don't want to load a template or see what's on marketplace pass. Matter of fact, I think that the user shouldn't even be forced to see what's on marketplace pass if they don't own it.</p>\n<p>2. The UI does not support low resolutions well.<br>On low resolutions, elements such as buttons stretch to fill more than 20% of the screen in some cases. This is unnecessary and looks ugly.</p>\n<p>3. The UI runs poorly on a flagship phone (ROG Phone 6)<br>It takes more than 5 seconds in usual cases to open \"create a new world\" with my phone. It should not take this long.</p>\n<p>4. It breaks UI mods and features.<br>UI mods no longer work with this new UI update. An example of a mod that has been broken from this update is a mod called \"MCPE Export Button\" which allows you to export worlds directly from Minecraft instead of digging for that file inside of Minecraft's Android/Data folder. Which as of recent is becoming inaccessible for security and privacy concerns from Google. Thus resulting in worlds to no longer be able to be exported from mobile devices.</p>\n<p>My solutions to these problems are to either rework the UI entirely to solve these problems that users are facing or to abolish the UI entirely or make it optional.</p>",

I agree with the perspective button, and I saw that it could be next to the pause button. I agree with that. I would also like to add just another button somewhere that can do exclusive PC functions (such as blocking with a sword).</p>\n\n<p>One of the most annoying things is the hold finction. You can't jump and shoot without a problem. Bow spam is also tricky to pull off (bow is my favorite weapon). It is also annoying to mine many blocks if you have to let go of it constantly. In all, the hold-screen function causes inefficiency time-wise, and this can interfere with time-based fights with mobs or players. I propose that the function activates as soon as the finger touches the screen and carries out if the screen is still held. Yes, this means that the action starts like if you tapped the screen instead. To prevent hold functions being done on accident, the time to hold to carry out a hold-screen action can be customizable (nothing crazy, because who needs to hold for 2 seconds anyway).</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, everything else in this suggestion is looking good.</p>",

When it comes to everyday mining, the hold trigger makes mining a single block longer meaing that large mining projects are very time consuming while often enough, tools with efficiency enchantments mine more blocks than indended.</p>\n<p>Also, the middle button that appears only under certain circumstances such as \"Fish\", or \"Trade\" is awkward to reach and since it is unique to Pocket Edition, it takes time getting used to. I still ocassionally, slap a villager before trading.</p>\n<p>When it comes to casual gameplay, I suggest to take inspiration from consoles and have similar \"X/Y\" or, \"A/B\" buttons to be placed on screen for \"Use/Place\" and \"Attack\". Also having said buttons toggleable in settings wouldn't affect existing players and would benefit those who played on different platform such as PC, or XBOX before.<br><br>Now the combat gameplay, it doesn't go without saying that being forced to rotate camera while simultaneously tapping on the screen to attack is a proper pain and in my opinion, the \"combat mode\" post suggested, would make combat too easy.</p>\n<p>One of the comments suggested ability to lock camera to a mob so you can move back, forth, and around your target to sidestep, defend, or attack without interrupting cameras' view.</p>\n<p>I imagined this combat system to resemble that of a RPG game \"Gothic I\" from 2001 I played in my youth.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for reading.</p>",

This is a game changer for minecraft on mobile if implemented as not only does it made everything feels better to play it's also open new door for competitive PVP on mobile because the circle control is too clunky and unreliable if your opponents keep flanking into your blind spot. They gonna need some heavy ui changes in order to implement this is my guess so chances are this won't get change in awhile.</p>",

If game creators can do that  It will greatly improve the player experience, really, if you are reading my comments right now.  Don't worry too much about it cluttering the screen like other games.  The team created a game just by adding one more button on the top right of the screen.  It certainly wouldn't be annoying to play.  And can the makers of the creators adjust to have that button enabled or not?  All in all, it's not too difficult to make it happen on mobile Minecraft. It's not that hard to do.  It wasn't too hard for the filmmakers.  Please, please develop this section now.  I'm afraid that it will clutter the playing screen that you don't dare to add it in the game. Minecraft is the ultimate game like heaven for people to play good games. The real Minecraft is no one.  I can overtake it for sure.  Don't be afraid to add a button in the mobile version of the game please.  P.S. I started playing since the game was released in the first year in pe.  and also play on mobile  I can't switch to a game that copied Minecraft.  I've tried other games but it doesn't feel as fun and familiar as Minecraft.  And I believe a lot of players feel the same way.  Please pay attention to gaming knowledge that the keypad is easier to use but does not make the game too easy.  And still keep the Minecraft game. You guys can do it. Thank you very much.</p>",

Playing with split control and with gyroscope on will be extremely accurate in fighting mobs and building/breaking blocks, please Mojang, with this implemented the game would become perfect for me. </p>",

Playing Skyrim on the PS4 was a shock for me, coming from the PC version. Using a controller instead of a mouse drove me absolutely nuts. I got somewhat used to it, but never truly cared for it. Jumping to the PSVR version and gaining head tracking for precision aiming was a huge game changer, bringing it right to the PC's level of playability. I also ended up getting it on the Switch because I wanted a portable version, but didn't know at the time it had the gyro aiming. I loved it when I finally played it. I didn't find it quite as good as the headtracking of the PSVR, but it's just barely behind it in terms of playability, and light-years ahead of the basic analog stick control. I really think it would be a perfect match for Minecraft and pretty much make it the king of the console versions by a longshot. It's been ages since they mentioned the possibility of adding it, but I really, really hope they haven't given up on it.</p>",

Joystick controls will never be as precise as using a mouse, but gyro aiming is probably the closest we can get.  If we won't need to rely on the right stick as much, we will finally be able to jump while looking around without needing to change the control scheme. Aiming a bow would become less stiff, and even just block breaking and mob attacking would be less cumbersome overall.  This change would greatly make playing on a gamepad more close to playing on Windows 10 with a mouse, which would make things more fair.</p>",

O_o I haven't got any sensory disabilities or other reasons like that to use accessibility features but even as a regular player the subtitles give me more peace of mind knowing that i don't need to rely on _just_ my hearing sense.<br><br>There are sounds in Minecraft that can be really subtle or quiet and having a little subtitle pop up on screen works as a really good warning in some situations, like when you are going deep underground to mine those diamonds and sooner or later you are going to be dealing with those lava pools nearby as you search for those valuable ores. The directional info is helpful too, if you have problems distinguishing where a sound is coming from in your stereo field(or if you don't trust your ears/speakers/headphones)...<br><br>(Though i'm also surprised that i only now realised that the subtitles are missing. I'd have thought i'd notice such a thing much sooner lol Maybe it's because i only now started to go for those diamonds so i haven't needed to worry about hidden lava sources yet... Actually the low amount of votes on this suggestion is surprising too, wow. My vote was just 255th... well, anyways, hopefully me logging into the feedback hub to give vote helps for us getting this parity feature.

There are so many awesome tools to mob proof an area the only thing I’m missing the ability to tell the light level. </p>\n\n<p>I have the perfect solution. If you are really unwilling to give us access to the same data points Java players have then give us a tool that can sense the light level of the block it is pointed at. Call it a portable light sensor or something. Or better yet give us access to the data. I don’t know why I have to be punished for playing on bedrock. You think your making the game more challenging or intuitive. The only problem is EVERYONE consumes Java content. stop kidding yourself. We expect java abilities. I have gotten countless people to enjoy Minecraft YouTube content. Only to find they don’t want to play bedrock because it’s not what they expected. </p>",

I understand that there were technical differences that caused the changes between Java and Bedrock, but the game already knows the light level of each block, all it has to do is display it in some way like the Java version does.

If you don’t expect users to memorize what every block looks like at all the light levels, then this is something you should implement.</p>",

I've been waiting since way back when I was making nether reactor cores with her and fighting pigs with a sword on the wrong side. It wouldn't even need to be in the official vanilla default if that's too hard to make, I'm even willing to go tot the marketplace to get it as an add on or whatever.

I found this in the \"/storage/emulated/0/games/com.mojang/minecraftpe/valid_known_packs.json\" file as I have a few cached packs and realized that this is different from what I normally find while scrolling down the list of valid known packs, \"/storage/emulated/0/games/com.mojang/resource_packs/PackFolderName\". I have been unable to find the cached files unfortunately and can not figure out why this is, this is from an android user by the way if the directories look weird to you.</p>",

Additionally, all structure generation features are world-type specific, just like in the console edition. For example, the Ender dragon and the spawn pillars in The End preset. On top of that, I wish that, to match Java Edition parity, single biome worlds (and maybe even large biome worlds) could ALSO make their way to Bedrock Edition at some point.

The Biome should be a Savannah (Savannah Plateau just to be specific). The preset should generate Savannah Trees across the world or in Villages. As for mobs Armadillo’s &amp; Spotted Wolves should spawn as no other Superflat template has any way of Wolves or Wolf Armour being obtainable. As for structures villages &amp; Strongholds are fine but if possible I would like Dungeons to generate so we can build Mob Farms. As for layers 1 Grass layer 4 Dirt Layers Beneath 30 Layers of stone &amp; 10 Layers of Deepslate if possible could you add the functionality of some Ores generating (Normal Or Deepslate Ores whichever is fine). That way it makes obtaining Ores &amp; Minerals like Iron, Gold, Copper, Redstone &amp; Diamond Easier rather than Building Iron Farms or Bartering with Piglins for Iron Nuggets or farming Drowned just to get enough Copper for 4 Copper Blocks &amp; a Lightning Rod &amp; having to Loot several Nether Fortresses &amp; End Cities &amp; such.</span></p>",

Create a Realm and upload your world to it, now switch your minecraft back to external and download your realm back to your device. This will save your world as External and now allow you to back up or move that world as you please. It is a process, and if you already used your free trial for a realm up you will have to pay for it.</p>",

I think it's safe but be careful it isn't a virus. It definitely isn't the best method to do it, since you have to turn on USB debugging for it to work&nbsp; which puts your phone possibly at risk. (Bad programs can install virus apps etc. With USB debugging.)</p>\n<p>Update: I got the Minecraft Exporter to work, and it was able to restore my worlds!! I would like to make a video tutorial sometime. Once I got USB debugging to work, it was able to copy my worlds from Application storage to a MinecraftWorlds folder on my desktop. Then I could just copy it back to my phone, putting it in the external location for PE worlds (Internal storage/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds) Then it showed up in Minecraft PE, the same world, except now stored in External storage.</p>",

It wouldn't be a hard feature to implement, and it would save a lot of hassle for users.

Two weeks ago he dropped his Samsung tablet and broke the screen. His main worry there was if he is going to loose all his minecraft worlds.</p>\n<p>4. I want to send the tablet to service center for screen replacement. Before I do, I have to backup all his data. The service center has a policy to erase all data before any repair.</p>\n<p>5.Storage location in Minecraft - application, and I already know what it means.</p>\n<p>6. So far, I've copied ~200 worlds via Realms to my mobile (to external storage). I've already spent hours renaming all of the worlds so that I do not loose any of them in the process. They way this method works - the whole process will take 7 hours. Ah yeah - the screen is shattered, no bleeding yet.</p>\n<p>7. I do not have root access. Rooting the device will erase all data.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dear Minecraft support:</p>\n<p>a) How can I solve this issue?</p>\n<p>b) How a regular user will backup or change his phone without loosing all his worlds stored in the default app storage on an android device?</p>\n<p>c) Why, when I change Storage Location from application to external (and there are no worlds saved in external), why there is no 'Import from application storage' button?</p>\n<p>d) Is the implementation of copying files from one location to another - a too challenging task for the Minecraft dev team?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Designated buttons, navigation and running toggle needs a complete redesign. Fellow minecrafters, please upvote this comment and this post till mojang actually does something about it. We are counting on you devs :-)</p>",

So yes, I want you to add those. The benefits of a joystick controller is\n<br />-We dont need to put much power in our fingers to move\n<br />-We can move freer (add 2 virtual joystick one is fixed another is free)\n<br />-We can pvp better as because we can move freer and avoid damage more\n<br />So we can sprint, crouch and normally walk make a button icon on the right side to let us do that. Thanks </p>",

However, there are a few minor changes I would make. </p>\n\n<p> I wish there was a setting that allows me to change how far right (or left if you're a lefty) the movable joystick can go. As a regular gamer, having only one thumb to interact doesn’t feel right. Having a joystick in the middle of my screen gets in the way of using both fingers. It would be nice to have it go up and down as well as side to side. </p>\n\n<p> The joystick lock option could also be improved, as the only current option is to set it back to default. The one thing I would change about it is a personal lock. By that I mean once adjusted, the lock could keep it there rather than going back to default. This could apply to both the joystick and the other controls as well. Some might prefer the controls to be a bit lower, while others may want them up high. </p>\n\n<p> In any case, the product thus far is great and this is a huge step forward. Love and appreciate all the hard work and dedication the devs have put into this game over the years! Whether my two-sense makes it in or not, I love you all and thanks for the memories! </p>\n\n<p>Sincerely your unwaveringly loyal player: Reahn15</p>",

Ark mobile has the most intuitive and dynamically usable touch controls that could be copied 1-1 for minecraft and would give the mobile version a competitive control scheme to even console and PC versions. Yet we still have atrocious controls for this mobile version. Ark mobile has shown how perfect mobile survival games can make their controls. Mojang/Microsoft, what are you doing at this point? It's the single complaint I have with the game and yet nothing has been done to make similar to Ark mobile controls. Those said controls from Ark mobile literally eliminate the need for all buttons including (jump, crouch, hit/mine, and even sprint) this frees up the interface to be way more open, dynamic and literally makes all the aforementioned controls better in every way as to what the currently are. As of now it is near impossible to use any of the controls dynamically while doing other actions such as moving or looking. Meanwhile, Ark mobile controls make it not only possible but intuitive to the point where there is no drawback from PC or console controls and solves the (one at a time) control scheme that ruins the playability of mobile. Please mojang make this one change and I promise sales would go up for mobile by a thousand. It's undeniable how much more efficient, intuitive, and better Ark mobile controls are for this game.</p>",

In addition, I don't think you should have to scroll to see all the options. Why not try having some options side by side, like in Java Edition?</p>\n<p>In addition, when I view it in game, there is so much space either side of the list of options, which I really dislike, and is also why I hope that you will keep the settings menu as it was, just with a refreshed look.</p>\n<p>Also, it'd be nice to have an audio test option. Unlike with Master volume having the click sound as you modify the setting, I think it'd be nice to be able to set volume for Friendly mobs and then have a button which randomly plays a Friendly mob noise, and the same for the other audio options.</p>",

It’s inconvenient to jump between screens, and information feels too stretched out even on my 16:9 monitor, not to mention 21:9 ones.</p>\n<p>The redesigned Video Settings are organized much better than before, but there’s still room for improvement. For example, why is “In-game graphics mode switching” at the top (or why does it even need to exist), while it’s used only once and the much more frequently used “Field of View” slider is buried at the bottom.</p>\n<p>Options like “Render Clouds,” “Fancy Leaves,” and “Fancy Bubbles” would fit better under dropdown for each graphics mode, with values stored separately. That way players could enable both “Fancy Leaves” and “Fancy Bubbles” for Vibrant Visuals, keep only “Fancy Leaves” for Fancy Graphics, disable both for Simple Graphics, and switch between them with a click.</p>\n<p>Finally, the current Touch Controls settings screen feels cluttered, offering only three barely customizable presets. Joystick/D-Pad, Crosshair/Touch-to-interact, and button layout should be set separately, allowing players to mix what works best for them, for example, using “Interact” and “Attack” buttons with Joystick+Tap-to-interact, or the Joystick+Crosshair without any buttons, or combine buttons with the D-Pad. It’s also inconsistent that Crosshair/Touch-to-interact are fixed when using the joystick but toggleable, and from a completely different place, when using the D-Pad.</p>",

On older phones, transitions like this can be problematic. Because in some countries, many people still use potato phones. So I hope the developers can consider reducing the transition. But I think instead of making a UI like this, it's better to make a little touch of the old one, where the selection panel (on the left) is reduced, maybe like 25% and the remaining 75% is for the new UI. </p>",

It feels cleaner, more modern, and much easier to navigate than before, It also seems to load much quicker which is certainly a positive.</p>\n<p data-start=\"311\" data-end=\"691\">However, the placement of the <strong data-start=\"341\" data-end=\"364\">Field of View (FOV)</strong> setting is an issue. FOV is a commonly adjusted and important setting, yet it’s buried far down in the Video settings? This makes it inconvenient to access and doesn’t match how essential it is for gameplay comfort and accessibility. It would make a lot more sense for FOV to be placed higher up with other core video options.</p>\n<p data-start=\"693\" data-end=\"805\">Overall, the UI redesign is a step forward, but moving the FOV slider higher would noticeably improve usability.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Mojang, I feel there are similarities between Bedrock's OreUI and Samsung's OneUI. The similarities I've found are as follows: 1. OneUI and OreUI both only allow for basic customization. In OneUI, you can install themes, but only system icons and wallpapers can be changed. Similarly, OreUI currently only supports changing panoramas and home screen buttons; nothing else can be changed. However, there are also differences here: 1. OneUI has Goodlock, which allows users to edit third-party app icons, change themes, appearance, layouts, and more, without voiding the warranty. However, OreUI is locked and cannot be freely modified like it was with JsonUI. Mojang, please create a package that allows editing OreUI separately from the ResourcePack or create a new readable folder within the ResourcePack. This is all I can assess for this new OreUI. Hopefully Mojang reads this! Also, FIX MOJANG BEDROCK!</p>",

We know that “Old” has a limit but, the problem with that is it doesn’t offer the full experience like on the other world sizes.</p>",

I'd hoped the new features would have carried over to the new edition....Nope.  We don't even mess with anything on the classic maps. We liked the ability to find the edge of the map so now we don't even want to touch it. I doubt that's what mojang was going for. I am awaiting the day when they update that. It should be added as a 3rd map option. I hate having to keep track of coordinates when I am playing with my 5 and 6 year olds. It really sucks the fun out of it for me as a parent. Personally I love infinite but only to a point. The old classic map was so fun in survival mode. While I definitely love the ability to find  full sized biomes and mega villages ect, I really miss the classic size. If someone could bring that back. That would be awesome. We hate how small it is now. </p>",

Everyone I've talked to about resolving this has given me solutions that break tos for consoles and move players away from realms. There are bugs with gamerules not staying resident on realms. I've had issues with billing not staying synchronized with realm expiration, causing me to be double-billed multiple times to keep the realm online.</p>\n\n<p>I really want to like your service, but there are so many shortcomings.

Same with PC i have a 4070 and an i7 which should be able to handle max settings on minecraft I mean it can handle almost any other game perfectly fine. Also compatablility with addons like actions and stuff would be awesome. I think once these issues are fixed it would make a lot of players very happy.</p>",
