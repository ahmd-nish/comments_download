Once you get to the absolute highest point in the entire world, you will be greeted by a 30% chance of a new ore spawning called star fragments which you mine for stardust which is useful for enchanting and upgrading diamond tools and armor into celestial steel plate armor. New advancements: \n<br />top of the world! Achieved by climbing up to the highest point in an Astral peaks biome. \n<br />Up up and away!

Below you will find a transcription of the topic being discussed.</p>\n<p><br><strong>Title: “</strong>Idea about a new function for the elytras”</p>\n<p><strong>Text: </strong>“Well, when I discovered that they were going to put the new type of chest that will be in the trial chambers, I came up with a new object that could be added inside them or as a drop of the new mob (although a drop for the mob I don't think it will be added).<br>In what it would be that the object can be added by means of an anvil or in some other way, with a blacksmithing table it could be, and the function would be to attach it with the elytras to give a moderately possible impulse to take off with them and / or be able to brake with them, so you can have better control over the elytras. I would love for this to be added since there are players who are not good at flying with them, and the function that I am proposing in this opinion is not so crazy either.<br>Thank you for your attention, I love this game and I hope it continues to grow in the best way, so that we can all have a better gaming experience.<br>Atte. One more player from the community.”</p>\n<p>- Translated by Registered User</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
