I think that this is a great mechanic to add, maybe you can use your melee weapon to block an arrow/projectile quickly, with a three second cooldown, and it should disable all other movement and attack functions while blocking. Also the minimap is a great idea, wished for that myself before as well. Very creative ideas, and although they did say that they won't update Dungeons anymore, it may still come with the next Seasonal Adventure. Yay for Fauna Fair! Good luck on this idea, and again I think that it is very creative!</p>",
