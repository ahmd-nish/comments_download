Additionally potions of splashing glow will affect mobs, and make them glow <strong>Axolotls</strong> when use on will further help emit light underwater make them aggro guardians more, and be really cool looking under water. For people not wanting to hurt the mob, if you use a potion of glowing you can go up to the squid with a bucket and milk them for the glow ink, other wise they will stun you for maybe 3 seconds and swim away. So after you kill a few you can glow craft ink sacks into a gue that can be used to make a potion. Then if you want to get more in the future with less hassle, you use potion of glowing milk squid with bucket, bring it back to cauldron, use glass bottle to bottle it for brewing. 1 cauldron makes like 6 glass bottles or something. Adding different dye in the brewer makes light effect different colors. Red light cave flare style.</p>",

They're neutral, but like the Warden, they attack sound sources as potential food, similar to piranhas but with sound instead of scent. They'd be at a deeper/different area of underground caves than the warden (they have eyes, but realistically, fishes in the deep parts of the ocean sense vibrations rather than have actual eyes). Because they spawn in the water, players don't have to fight them too often.</p>\n<p>They have a follow range of 16. In deep oceans, they are neutral and are distracted by nearby fishes. In caves where there are less food sources, they feed on nearby mobs and players.

(So that the player would get close enough to hear the siren) 2 the should not follow you Youl just lose control of your character, heart particles will show up around you and your screen will turn pink, this should also be an effect called love. 3 But once your on the island the beautiful mermaid will become its true form! It is a scaly monster with big flipper like wings on its back and a flipper like the mermaid it's eyes will turn red and it's head will be the shape of a dolphins they are green and scaly, and make a sound like this \"hehehehehehehehermmmm if killed it will and drop the flute of the siren which will let you enslave any illager or make villager give you free stuff ,only one has per flute effect on illagers is permanent take not of this comment please!</p>",

I feel like there should be the three types of sirens that mythology mentions: the&nbsp;<em>celestial</em>, the <em>generative</em>, and the <em>purificatory / cathartic.&nbsp;</em>The first would have blonde hair, the second brown, and the third, black for they’re respecting rulers. (The first under Zeus, the second under Poseidon, and the third Hades.) The sirens should also be added to the Greek Mythology Mash-up world pack that is in the Marketplace. If you have stuck around long enough to read this through, I will be very happy!</p>\n<p>Thx!</p>",
