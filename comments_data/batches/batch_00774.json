They either won't fit the design, or will be another random mob or item that serves absolutely no unique or beneficial purpose. Minecraft is meant to have a simple set up that you can explore, expand and build on to create your own complex world(s). The majority of your suggestions just entirely miss that point. It's not a game with fixed missions or objectives either, so having seasonal events tied directly into your worlds makes absolutely no sense. It's an open world game. Try thinking feedback through before posting whatever comes into your mind, or just asking for more of certain stuff. Believe me, most of the suggestions that just pop up into your mind won't work if you don't give them a second and even third thought. Posting suggestions that come instantly to your mind makes you sound like you're meming.</p>",

How is that not enough for any technical player or builder? Even the smallest ones probably have a couple hundred of minerals at least, and those ones are very occasional/rare. They're not impossible to find either, not at all. If you know what you're doing and are a dedicated cave explorer (which a lot of people will be after we get the new generation and biomes), you can find them within a few hours, and it's incredibly rewarding and satisfying when you do so, from what I heard. They're not too hard to find at all, just hard enough so that when you find them and start mining, it feels like they were well earned due to the strategy put into it. Of course, some people would still favor making Iron farms, and that's why they are there in the first place, so that every playstyle has an option. However, I heard of very few people who would make Iron farms within an hour, and even then they wouldn't be the most efficient ones at all. Usually most people go mining during the early game first until they could upgrade sufficiently to make an Iron farm that they could really rely on, since mining is the most reliable and easy way of getting resources early game (besides diamonds, probably).</p>",

A couple of them should provide huge amounts like so.

Also in terms of design, the old ores are just ugly by comparison. They all look the same, which makes absolutely no sense. Different materials should look different. That's the normal in Minecraft and not the exception. Even the mineral blocks look different from each other, except for Gold and Diamond blocks. Iron nuggets look different from gold nuggets. All of the raw ores look different. Even Netherite tools have subtle differences compared to other tools, other than when it comes to color. I'd say that all materials should have different looking blocks, armor, and very subtly different tools like with Netherite.</p>",

If you think about it, it was very odd and unfair that we couldn't Fortune metal ores before. This hasn't really messed with the powers of Fortune, it just made it fair in my opinion. However, yes, enchantments (and magic) as a whole need to get rarer and more valuable, though this might be something for the near future.</p>",
