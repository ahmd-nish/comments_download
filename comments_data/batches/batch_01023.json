And Increasing render to 12 didn't completely do it for the old builds. We had no problem with lag with the old render. As far as the mountains go, if flying with elytra high enough to miss the new tall mountains, you can not see the ground and have no idea where you are. If not flying high enough you just might fly straight into one. Before you could actually fly above 256 and still see all the way down to y = 0.&nbsp; Any yes, this was in multiplayer even with a render of 4. I have tested it.&nbsp; I realize that some players don't have powerful computers, but they could always reduce the render client side and still play. After more than 6 years our building server is now a ghost town after 1.18.1. Our members don't want to play like this. If you want to render in a cylinder instead of a square, fine. But don't limit the height. And the fog is a pain as well</p>",
