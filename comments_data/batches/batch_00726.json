However, one thought is that if you come down shifting and land, it won't tilt. Additionally with this though, normally just shifting on it should have no effect on it tilting. This would allow for platforms that you can only stay on for limited time, and which you must shift to land on. If you don't fall when shifting, then they would become magma blocks except fall instead of take damage. While this would be okay, it would render the natural timed platform function useless.</p>",

I think that this is a fair change, considering that with the Nether and zombified piglins, gold is very easily obtained. However this means that drowned farms will be nerfed even more on Java (the drop rates are already much lower than on Bedrock), and by changing this, the lore behind the connection between the aquatic mobs and gold wouldn't make much sense anymore. As Rooveloft said, there should be a fair compromise where both ingots have the same chance of dropping, by splitting the percentage. (11% on Bedrock to 5.5% per ingot, and 5.5% on Java to 2.25%). This is also a good opportunity for Mojang to fix the parity between drop rates.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Please see this, Mojang, this post is very important.</p>",
