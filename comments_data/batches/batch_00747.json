Since aquifers are not affected by the decreased Diamond, Gold and Coal exposure, players now really have a reason to go mining through caves underwater. That decreased exposure might also make you want to use TNT in order to clear out big areas and find the most ores, which is an option that literally no one used before. The new expansive cave now also bring a completely different experience to traversing the caves, as you would want to use an Elytra to explore the huge areas. Nobody ever used Elytras in caves before. Ofcourse with using the Elytra to traverse and explore and find ores, there is also the risk of crashing into Pointed Dripstone, in which case you'd fall and you'd be facing even more danger because of the Stalagmites. Even if you're not flying, you could take some seriously increased damage from falling onto Stalagmites, and of course falling while in caves happens quite often, so there is increased risk to traversing Dripstone Caves. The purpose of the new caves was not to force the player to do anything, it was to create new gameplay and journeys that players could and would want to experience. Even just the new cave generation and ore distribution manage to create new journeys and gameplay that you can experience if you want to.</p>",

I would prefer that there be some random block generation on the outside of the bedrock wall, so we don’t have the cubes and columns of bedrock when we encounter old chunks. However this seems the most elegant solution to me. It preserves the feel of the old generation without the downsides of spawnable areas that are inaccessible or the detriment to those who went through the effort to make void perimeters. Additionally, for the very motivated, there is the chance to find a bedrock breaking method and then take the chance of building something in these chunks that floats above the void... not me but braver souls. </p>",

        "body": "<p>The devs spoke about adding an element of strategy to mining. I think something like this will add to more than just the mining aspect of the game.</p>\n\n<p>I think ores should generate randomly in the world in large veins, and that they should generate with other veins of ores in a general area, an \"ore rich\" area. It would encourage people to set up actual mines and give some much needed use to rails and minecarts.</p>\n\n<p>Inversely there would be \"resource poor\" areas, where ores spawn like they do now, perhaps slightly sparser. Perhaps when the world is generating a biome could be one of the two, save for unique situations like the gold in mesas or emeralds in mountains. Maybe mineshafts have increased ores, and you can take them over like a village and rehabilitate it.</p>\n\n<p>Imagine playing on a server and basing in an area with scarce resources and having to either explore and set up a mine, or grind other things and trade for ores.     </p>\n\n<p>A game about mining should include the task of prospecting. Depending on how the generation is tweaked and how much ore you can find, this could be a good alternative to farms if you need massive quantities of materials for mega builds/projects, which basically require that you abuse the games mechanics just to gather them in a reasonably timely manner. At the same time you will still have to explore the world for new areas to mine once the returns start diminishing on your current mine.</p>",
