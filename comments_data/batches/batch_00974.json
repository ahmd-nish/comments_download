If the ore gave some sort of bonus against the wither, being rare already, and led to increased speed for fighting the wither, with some sort of more exciting loot from said wither, I would be 100%. I 70% disagree with this suggestion, as I believe minecraft should be more of a sandbox than a 100% forced progression type of game, (though I still like the idea of progression). However, if the wither had more of a purpose for us to fight it, A.K.A. more and better loot, and was changed a bit, I would have no problem with the progression from this kind of boss fight. An example of loot would be some sort of key, for a new boss/for opening a door, or a new material of sorts. A unique idea would be something allowing zombification/zombie cures for mobs, and strange science experiments you could do from this new loot. Something interactive, and interesting, without extended requirements. To build/implement.</p>\n\n<p>I like where your idea is going. </p>",

I had a bit of trouble working out the syntax to use the give command for this but you can put the map in a chest by using this command &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>data merge block x y z {Items:[{Slot: 0b, id:\"minecraft:filled_map\", Count:1b, tag: {map:###}}]}</p>\n<p>where x y z are the coordinates of a (preferably empty) chest and ### is the number of the original map before locking. The map will be in the top left slot of the chest.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>A time mechanic, and the ability to traverse it! The game memorizing states and constantly tracking things such as number and state of all blocks/objects in a world, block placement, world states, seasons, death time and location, and player/other inventories over the course of in game time. Exact date could be represented as a coordinate.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't expect much, especially at first because of system requirements. I imagine it would be impossible to memorize exact player or mob movements, for example. Maybe it could be done to an extent though.</p>\n\n<p>I see this as an opportunity to have the game automatically save more/introduce the ability to travel further forwards or backwards in time. You can already skip (aka time travel) to the next morning by sleeping in a bed at the beginning of night, so if commands were input via creative menus, or an exact date input into a time machine* (see time machine item post) the player(s) would get a chance to go to a previous, current, or future time and date, but at current coordinates. Since you can't turn off the autosave feature anymore, if you die and lose an item, it's gone. A good way to think about this is like a new coordinate; a new category of location. It'd enable one to farm crops/resources that aren't currently ready for harvest, revisit past destroyed structures, bring back deceased companions as long as they were named with a nametag, and undo undesired actions (going afk to have your house be blown up by a creeper.)</p>",
