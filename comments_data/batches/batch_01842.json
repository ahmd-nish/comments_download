This&nbsp; would include pillagers, vindicators, witches, ravagers, and rarely evokers. And for the anti-beacon, or de-con, I figure that it could simply work by only affecting the player and not hostile mobs when it is naturally generated, until the player has harvested it and placed it themselves, then it will affect hostile mobs and not the player. Otherwise, wonderful idea, I support it all the way! Perhaps it could be an uncommon structure in mountain biomes, I feel like that would be cool.</p>",

I do still believe pillagers should be the most common when it comes to the fortress, but the others being there also sounds quite interesting. The only question I have now is what should the fortress be made out of and what would power an anti beacon. One thing to consider when discussing this is how rare this structure will be in comparison to the items found within it, and the blocks it's made of.</p>",

I was actually coming here to suggest this very thing, but checked if anyone else suggested it yet, and lo and behold, they have. I do think it needs to be described a little better though, so here you go:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nether portals can be made both horizontally and vertically, perhaps even in any shape we want.</li>\n<li>Portals of all kinds get a special render, which shows the other side, including mobs moving around, such as the Nether or End (basically it loads the chunks on the other side of the portal, as long as the portal itself is loaded).</li>\n<li>Transfer to the new dimension is as instantaneous as possible, so it feels more fluid to travel to dimensions.</li>\n<li>Recommend having an option to disable the render, so that players with weaker PCs don't get massive frame drops when around portals.</li>\n<li>The ability to fly through nether portals with an elytra, and ride through nether portals on a mount.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think that pretty much gets everything? Ideally, Mojang would implement this in a way that modders can even take advantage of easier, but that's not super important, and is up to Mojang in the end if they want to make it easier for us.</p>",

The main loot in a ship should be a chest but the minor ones that are more accessible should be barrels, or even just have one or two on the deck with junk in them for decoration, or even laying somewhere near the ship on the ocean floor filled with \"goods\" the ship was carrying. Would be a good way to get crops, seeds, or other minor items early.</p>",
