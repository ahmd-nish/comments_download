They love it so much that they wear it as armor and forge their weapons out of it. That shouldn't make sense because even though gold is extremely valuable, it is a really soft metal. Gold is the weakest tier (besides leather) but Piglins love it anyway, making Piglin technology rather inferior.</p>\n<p>Tin scraps build on the theme that Piglin civilization is built on \"inferior\" metals. Like gold, tin is soft and weak. It could even disintegrate (tin pest). Thats why pewter (~90% tin) wasn't that useful for anything more than decoration and tableware. That doesn't stop it from being prevalent in Piglin civilization. Thats why you can scavenge scraps of tin from the rubble and junk Piglins leave behind.</p>\n<p>Like gold, tin is rare. Thats my reasoning why you don't find tin ore. Instead, you recycle the scraps of tin the Piglins have already hoarded.</p>\n<p>Also like gold, tin is valuable. It was sought after for its use in bronze, which is as strong as iron. Piglins don't have copper, but the player from the Overworld does, so if they can get tin from the Nether, they can craft bronze.</p>\n<p>Tin scrap also juxtaposes netherite scrap, which is used to create the strongest tier. Even though you find it in the Nether, you don't get it from Piglins. The gold-possessing Piglins don't seem to utilize it at all. Its remnant of an ancient civilization that has been long gone.</p>",

A structure in the sky that is generated with a low probability \"Castle in the sky\" ... I think this structure will be modeled on a fictitious castle that appears in a famous movie. This structure has a chest of loot. Then, new mobs \"Angel\", \"Sky Beast\", \"Gargoyle\", and \"Golem in the Sky\" appear in the structure, and in the center of the structure is the mob \"Archangel\" who is a middle boss. .. In addition, there will be a small island called \"Tree of Life Sky Island\" where only one very large tree \"Tree of Life\" was created in Micra! On this island, endermans, creepers (rarely charged creepers also appear), slimes, phantoms, and silverfish will appear, including the \"heavenly beast\" that appears in the \"castle in the sky\". In addition, a new mob \"Simurgh\" that appears only on that island will appear. You can take care of this flying mob in some way, and you can even ride it like a horse. By the way, this tree of life can be processed like any other tree, but it is so hard that it can only be obtained with a diamond ax or a netherite ax. There are also seedlings, but they can be planted normally, but it takes a long time to grow, and one stack (64 pieces) of bone meal is required. And when grown, it grows to a size and height that ordinary trees cannot. I have a lot of other ideas, but I'll just do this.</p>",

The latter is far too OP and will 1000% never be added, as it removes the creativity of having to use what you have in innovative ways to make what you want, and cause far too much lag. If you mean just 'painting' the entire block, you may as well just combine the block with a dye in the crafting table. I guess you could click on a cauldron of coloured water to 'dye' it, but Java Edition is currently missing this feature and would require far too much time to implement for just a 'painted block'.

As it stands shields are perfect offhand tools for combat dual wielding would have to be powerful enough to have a good reason to be used instead of a shield and not too powerful where pvp fights last seconds. In addition this would have great conflict with the java cool down mechanic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
