Already in Minecraft there is some work towards creating a more diverse arsenal (axe damage to shields, the trident), and a mace would be an amazing addition to that. Perhaps it should have its own enchantments, such as crushing (same effect as sharpness) and armour breaker (increases % of damage done to armour). They should also do more damage to skeletons/wither skeletons (and maybe the wither) as a mace would be more effective than a sword.</p>\n<p>Also, I have just posted (assuming it gets approved) my own idea for a new weapon, the twinblade, but under the idea of having more new weapons, so as such I have included a link to this post. If you object to this I can remove it, but I thought, as I would like to see new weapons included in the game, that a link was entirely appropriate.</p>",

Charging the axe does a lot more damage and charged shots should increase the drop rate of mob heads. Also battle axes should be crafted the same way an axe is currently crafted but instead of doing the axe head pattern on one side of the crafting grid, you do it on both so it would cost two sticks and 5 of the given material. </p>",

There is so much you can do with blaze rods and blaze powders that it sucks that there is only one way to get it, and that is by killing Blazes which is a hostile mob. And Peaceful Difficulty gets rid of Hostile Mobs. It is like the one key that you can't find to unlock a new level. I love being very creative in Minecraft and I don't mind surviving and thriving but I don't like to hear another sound of a Creeper exploding near me.</p>\n<p>The best way to solve this would pretty much have it as loot in Nether Fortresses' chests. That is the most simplest fix by simply adding in Blaze Rods to the loot tables. Nether Fortresses are usually pretty hard to find and would require you to travel hundreds and thousands of blocks in the dangerous Nether Dimension. Of course you are in Peaceful Difficulty, so you won't get squashed by Magma Cubes or get yeeted by Piglin Brutes and Ghasts, but it is still SUPER dangerous when you have large lava oceans to journey across unless you have a lovely Strider. Another suggestion also to make Slimeballs a bit easier to obtain and the most obvious is put a chest in Witch Huts.</p>\n<p>The MOST important thing is to make Blaze Rods easy to obtain for players playing in Peaceful Difficulty. Mojang, please add Blaze Rods in Nether Fortresses' as one of the items in Chests.</p>",

The deal with pocket, however, is that it is often difficult to fight mobs, especially in the Nether. Making the Blaze neutral in Peaceful would allow for both:\n<br />1. Players on pocket to enjoy the game more without being scared of dying every couple seconds due to a smudge or water drop on the screen \n<br />2. Players who are locked to playing in peaceful (parental rules, personal choice, etc.) to complete the game</p>\n\n<p>No matter what way it is done, blaze rods need to be obtainable in peaceful.</p>",

Maybe for the teleportation enchantment, the player who enchanted it can link it to another mirror (or other mirrors) so that as soon as you step through the enchanted mirror, you surface out of the mirror it is linked to. (Or, if the mirror is liked to multiple others, the player would enter a small in-between area that has 1X2 spaces through which you can see the areas in front of the linked mirrors. Walking through one of these spaces would land you in front of the corresponding mirror.)</p>\n<p>I don't think adding silver to the game for the sole purpose of using it to craft mirrors is necessary.

For me, we have three options concerning colored wooden planks.</p>\n<p>1) We add colored variants for all 16 colors, all 6 wood species, and all wood products; this would lead to around 700 new items/blocks, which would be far too many.</p>\n<p>2) &nbsp;We add colored wood, but limit it to only one \"wood type\", and only add it for the planks, slabs, and stairs. The problem here is that this would go in the opposite direction that I think&nbsp;Mojang wants to go in in terms of game design philosophy. With the recent additions of new buttons, pressure plates, bark blocks, stripped logs, stripped bark, etc. it seems to me that Mojang is working to standardize wood blocks to where each species of wood gets equally represented in an ever-expanding list of wood products. Adding a new class of wood that is implemented only half as much as other types would upset the way things are balanced right now.</p>\n<p>3) We let go of the colored wood idea and look for better options, like concrete *hint hint*</p>\n<p>I'm not against colored wood in principle, I just think that in order to execute it, we either would have to add a ridiculous amount of new blocks, or implement it in a way that ruins the consistency of the way things are now. That's why I would prefer alternatives.</p>",
