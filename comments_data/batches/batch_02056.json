Today's jobs can stay in but you can add builder and soldier with sword, axe, bow defending the villages, for example. And that you can give them tasks on a piece of paper or something and if you give them that piece of paper that they do. Make different ranks soldiers commander and all that. and more real life jobs when you make a city like fire brigade, police, thief and things like that. so that it really seems like a city and making food and other things. but especially builders and soldiers. Why because then there are people who finally defend the villages and you don't necessarily have to build everything yourself. How do you want to do that build a building save it as a blueprint so to speak and you can give it to the villager and it builds it and forms a team together. of course you need hunters but also people who are looking for the resourches together. The last time that ranks doe commander will know what to do about his army, archer, soldier, scouts. Let's see for yourself which jobs are even more possible.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;\">- Translated by&nbsp;Admin</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
