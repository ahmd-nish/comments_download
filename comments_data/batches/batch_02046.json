And should this be applicable to maps of any part of the world? As you pointed out yourself, this might cause a lot of unwanted lag if the areas of the world on the map has to be loaded for the map to be updated.<br>Perhaps it should be limited to a certain size of maps and also perhaps only maps of the local area.</p>\n<p>But another idea. Task the cartographer to walk around the village boundary and then place a couple of banners to show to mark out the boundary.<br>Alternatively have the cartographer sell a special map of the current village it resides in that has a green outline showing the exact border of the village. A player can then use this to determine where to build a wall around as a defence against illagers/raids.</p>\n<p>I would also really like for the cartographer to sell an explorer map of other villages and not just woodland mansions and ocean monuments.
