Or instead of riding Minecraft ones updates your putting it straight into the new game which is just STUPID!!! While it might seem like a good idea at first, your just repeating Minecraft one with its update. Now don't get me wrong, this is just my opinion and nothing else Because Mojang, you could do something completely different and amazing, but if its close to what I just said I wouldn't put much time into it because it just seems like a waste of time. Thank you for your time, Goodbye :).</p>",
