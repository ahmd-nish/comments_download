I think Quests could be one way to nudge players in the right direction and help them progress through the game. What if they are unaware of the Nether or the End existing or the ability to travel there? It is unfortunate that some people may miss out on the Lush Caves, Ancient Cities, and Mountain Peaks. I think giving rewards for traveling to these far off places will get people more excited about adventuring- much like Woodland Explorer maps and Ocean Explorer maps. This in turn will increase their odds of progressing to the Nether and into the End. \n<br />Late game rewards would be great too, and those players would also enjoy additional adventure opportunities. A feature like Questing is nice because it can cater to every player regardless of how long they have been playing or where they are at in their adventure.</p>",
