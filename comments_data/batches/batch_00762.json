They actually Left the OLD world generation code from 1.16 and prior in the game for mapmakers. you can get old terrain back by simply making a .MCTEMPLATE and setting the set world version number to something under 1.17 BOOM you got old terrain back. or you can edit level.dat and change the world generator to 1. you can do that but i suggest not to with a world you wanna play. it will make new 1.18 chunks stick out of the ground 64 blocks. thats how the game tries to level the world together.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This only would work on bedrock though. because they never remove things cuz of marketplace creations and servers. so you can get it back on bedrock. but not java</p>",
