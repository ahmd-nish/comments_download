        "body": "<p>it says this Offer: Copper Hoppers Objective: To extend the functionality of copper by adding balanced sorting and distribution mechanisms based on oxidation mechanics. 1. Copper Sorting Hopper Kraft: 5 Copper Ingots + 1 Chest. Oxidation Mechanics: Wear: The funnel oxidizes (4 stages) over time, which reduces the speed of moving objects. Requires maintenance. Maintenance: Use Honey Wax to fix the condition or Axe to remove oxidation. Programmable Filtration: Through the Comparator and the Book Chair: The signal (force 1-5) selects a specific slot for filtering. The funnel only lets this type of object pass through. Limitation: Does not change the direction of drainage. Role: Creating compact, serviced sorters. 2. Copper Dynamic Funnel with Redstone (Copper Dynamic Hopper) Kraft: 5 Copper Ingots + 1 Chest + 1 Redstone Dust. Dynamic Distribution: No Sorting: Does not filter items; misses everything.&nbsp;Directional Control: The active Redstone Signal switches the drain direction 90 degrees, allowing flow to branch (for example, left/right). Balance: Cannot direct items back to the block that feeds items into it (loop protection). Role: Compact, managed distribution node for logistics. Benefits: Introduces a new, intuitive way to work with logistics, adds the time cost of automation through wear (oxidation) and fits perfectly into the copper theme</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
