It can be as rare as it needs to be to avoid upsetting gameplay balance. But I want a defended fortress to contain an active nether portal somewhere inside it and have that portal align with a Nether chunk that contains the max number of ancient debris (currently 6)</p>\n\n<p>I *HATE* mining for ancient debris. It is absolutely no fun randomly blowing up beds in nether rack and just looking around to see if anything useful happened. If I could instead explore the Overworld, find a fortress to conquer and have the prize be a pinpointed location of a rich Nether chunk, that would be loads of fun.</p>\n\n<p>If \"some important people\" were to get really ambitious, adding a Raid aspect to the fortress assault would be even better. We have Village Defense Raids; it would be really cool if we could get Fortress Assault Raids.  The vision I have in my head for the fortress would be 4 stone motif Pillager Outposts set up in a square, connected by rampart walls, and a central Keep tower that has the portal at the top. Storm the castle, climb the stairs, portal to Nether, mine for the prize.</p>",

Kinda like how donkeys all have the same spawning stat for speed, but get better with breeding. This would also allow people to breed happy ghasts and develop a steady population of ghasts in the overworld. The offspring could even have growth stages like horses and mules, with one in-game day cooldown for breeding ghasts. This would help keep them still rare, but definitely a bit cooler imo</p>",

Maybe they get slower the more time goes on to serve as an indication to the player that they need to be fed again? Perhaps the base speed should also be increased, but as another user commented they find it to be the perfect speed for building, so it would need to be a subtle increase.&nbsp;</p>",

This change is very inconvenient for mobile players like me.</p>\n\n<p>Before this update, we could freely customize controls at any time, whether in the main menu or during gameplay. Now, having to go to a specific screen just to rearrange or tweak buttons makes the game less flexible and user-friendly.</p>\n\n<p>For many players, especially those who rely on customized layouts for better PvP, building, or general gameplay, this limitation significantly affects the experience.</p>\n\n<p>I kindly request you to bring back the ability to customize controls at any time, just like before. This small change had a big impact, and restoring the old behavior would make many players happy.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for listening to your community!</p>\n\n<p>– A Concerned Minecraft Player</p>",

Want to build? the mobility now is on point, maybe when  we go third person, the field of vision should be able to be adjusted so we can see where we are going since the collision box of the happy ghast is gigantic. Want to travel? maybe a new item found in the nether (not the end, since when you get there you are now closer to the elytra) than makes the happy ghast not insanely faster, but maybe a little boost that would rival the speed of a normal ghast? it could be a consumable item to make it balanced.\n<br />I don't think the speed should be changed but rather make it possible so we can modify it as we need it\n</p>",

But if you want to travel it is so annoyingly slow you might want to go on foot instead. It shouldn’t be as fast as the elytra. I find it if I set the Flying Speed to 0.07 it’s okay for closer travels but when you want to travel to far places 0.1 is an amazing speed. So my idea would be a mechanism like dashing with camel or the double W to run on foot but I think the perfect solution would be 3 stages: the current normal speed, then 0.07 for light travel and 0.1 for far travels. Maybe you need to achieve something or get an item or enchant the Harness but the speed upgrade is a must if we want the happy ghast to be more than a cute decoration.</p>",

The happy ghast should bé equipable with a kind of flight pack, a booster harness (I m not sure about the name), and with this, by powering it with gunpowder or even directly with firework rockets, it could reach higher speeds while still being able to go slow for building! I think that would be a nice modification since it does not change the way happy ghast behave till now while making it a better way for transportation that could make players leave their elytras even in long created survivals! Of course there should be some cooldowns, and maybe making this impossible if the happy ghast is holding mobs with a leash but please add this that would be Amazing !!</p>\n<p>Btw, sorry for the typo, im French and probably not the best english writer, but I think you'll get what I mean however!&nbsp;</p>",

Biomes are best exploered on foot and being able to flyover anything completely kills any challenging experience of&nbsp; navigating around biomes especially early to midgame when the happy ghast is usaully acquired. Also the happy ghastly being faster would make it worse due to its big hit box making it more uncontrollable than it already is when maneuvering around jagged cliffs and tighter areas because the happy ghasts primary function would be building and transporting other mobs. It has no use in combate with pilligers or skeletons that will always hit it's massive hit box, and if it's used for transport it can already be dragged along quickly when leaded to a horse. Also, please do not add a snowball on a stick or happy ghast armor because the mob is already ridiculous enough, and minecraft really doesn't need a lower age rateing especially when younger kids shouldn't be playing videogames.</p>",

Possui uma fornalha frontal com uma pequena chaminé que emite fumaça quando ativa, 4 rodas maiores e detalhes visuais como tubos e engrenagens.Funcionamento:Combustível: Abra o inventário da locomotiva para adicionar carvão, lenha ou outros combustíveis, que alimentam a fornalha.Reservatório de Água: Um tanque traseiro precisa ser preenchido com baldes de água (ou automaticamente em biomas aquáticos). Se o tanque secar, o motor superaquece e para até ser reabastecido.Velocidade e Capacidade: A locomotiva é mais rápida que o carrinho de mina comum e pode puxar até 6 carrinhos extras (como baús ou passageiros) sem perder desempenho.Interatividade:Clique e segure para abrir a interface, que mostra o nível de combustível, água e status do motor.Efeitos visuais como vapor e faíscas adicionam imersão enquanto ela se move.</p>",

They are slow and you can now just craft a saddle and ride away. Also in the late game WE HAVE ELYTRAS. For mob transit it’s clear Mojang wants us to use the Happy Ghast for mob transportation. Whats the point of making minecarts leashable? Instead, make minecarts faster, rails less expensive, and allow us to make self rail placing and collect carts as a train system that does require you to put rails down. Add dispenser minecart and put it next to whatever you want to be transported in a minecart behind it. Fill the dispenser with what are now cheaper rails and activate it with red stone and watch them go. You should be able to push this machine to alter its destination on the go. As for minecarts crashing. Just remove crashing?</p>",

Another thing I noticed, and I'm pretty sure this is a bug, is that the orange tint of the sunset/sunrise shows THROUGH the ground. I thought it was just an all over effect, like golden hour or something, but if I stand still and look around at the ground, it only turns orange when I'm facing the sunset.

Flying around now feels like being stuck in a chlorine-filled indoor pool. It’s uncomfortable to look at and genuinely causes eye strain, especially after long play sessions.<br>When playing for hours, this forces us to focus much harder than before, which is exhausting and unhealthy. In dark oak forests during thunderstorms, it gets so bad that you can barely see anything.</p>\n<p>This is more than a visual preference it’s a comfort and accessibility issue. Not everyone can or wants to install mods just to remove something that could easily be a setting.</p>\n<p>Minecraft has always been about player freedom and choice. So why are we being forced into a single visual style with no way to adjust it? There are already hundreds of votes on this feedback thread, and plenty of players (including myself) are staying on 1.21.5 just to avoid this fog.</p>",

My post wasn’t about partly adjusting it it was about adding a proper option to turn it off or customize it same for that at feedback.minecraft.net. Instead, they just tweak it a little and call it a fix. It honestly makes me wonder if they’ve read their own feedback thread at all: feedback.minecraft.net.</p>\n<p>If they can polish every tiny detail of visuals like missing pixels or texture seams why not give players the simple choice to keep it like before? I get that they need to balance their focus between requests, feedback, and bug fixes, and that they have a huge library of ideas to sort through. But maybe that system for prioritizing needs to be a bit better so something like this not being kept hanging.</p>",
