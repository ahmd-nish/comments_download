This makes sense for balancing reasons atm, but the argument should perhaps be that this balancing could need a rework.<br><br>Ideally all mounts should be able to act as pack animals, perhaps at the expense of not being able to be mounted or equipped with armor if there's items in the inventory (this seems to be a viable next step given the recent improvements to the leashes functionality); though current pack animals should probably be exempt from such restrictions to give them an edge as pack animals. The current balancing should also be made more consistent, for example making the llamas individual random strength attribute an universal factor among the mounts.<br><br>My +1 vote is therefore with the notion of a proper rebalancing and consistency check on mounts in general, or \"better mounts\" if you will.

If it consistently opened chests beginning with the one closest to the copper chest and then the next closest and so on, it would make item sorting more reliable. An item-sorting setup works best when the CG checks the copper chest, then the next, up to the tenth which is outfitted with a hopper to carry unmatched items to another CG's sorting area. But if the CG checks chests randomly, it may encounter the \"empty\" hopper chest before an earlier chest already containing the matching item, thereby sending the item on to an end-of-the-line overflow chest where it would need to be returned to the input chest for resorting. Please consider adding a priority system to the chests checked by the copper golem.</p>",
