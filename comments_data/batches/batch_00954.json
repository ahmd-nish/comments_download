Is there a way to have the chance to use creative, and then have the option to give up creative when we feel we’re done with creating our version of Minecraft to play in survival and get achievements?? That would be pretty super. I have an older map I had created and luckily switched over to survival before you guys removed achievements if someone used creative, and I love it. I am satisfied to a degree that I made my own custom world and now I get to play it. Make no mistake, I enjoy being locked in survival, but I just wish I can make something unique in Creative and then play in that afterward in Survival and still get achievements. Please!!</p>",
