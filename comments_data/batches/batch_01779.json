A lot of the new music is very loud compared to the older stuff. Currently if I want to use the background music I have to turn it down to about 20 when the new music comes on, which makes older tracks barely audible. It would be great if you could normalize the audio so that one volume setting could consistently be used across all tracks. Having a blast with the update otherwise. Thanks! </p>",

It's louder and jarring at times unlike C418's music which is more legato and fades in better for a game that is supposed to be more relaxing as you build, mime, and explore. The new music takes me out of the game I couldn't stop playing when I first found it. All I want is an option to choose the \"Legacy\" (C418) osts, the new ost, or both.</p>",
