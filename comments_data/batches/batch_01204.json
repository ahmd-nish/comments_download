While MultiMC is 3rd-party, it still requires auth, so it's still a legitimate launcher that requires purchase of the game. I mention this here because Microsoft might see it and want to fight the people who made the launcher. I don't condone taking them down, they aren't affecting the bottom line.</p>",

In my humble opinion, nothing was more iconic than the grass block, which practically screams MINECRAFT!&nbsp; While the developers may have gotten tired of seeing the same icon, some of us users are quite attached to it.&nbsp; We should have that choice to keep our historic icon, or accept the new default one, by including other [past] icons in the .exe file for us to choose from in the launcher's properties.&nbsp; If not included in the launcher .exe file, please have the updater download an .ico file into the launcher directory for us to choose other icons from.</p>",
