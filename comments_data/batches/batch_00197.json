Players who are slain by this legendary phantom are stripped of their loot on death before being transported to the Sky dimension. If defeated it will drop an elytra and on rare occasions a glowstone block. To travel to the Sky dimension a 4 respawn anchors is first required, once all are connected in a connected square formation fill each up with phantom membranes, portal textures will change grey once one is filled and will change one more time when all 4 are filled connecting textures like chest then turning the full portal a golden color. Only two of the legendary phantom’s can spawn per 1 player. Its has an extra 10 more heath points than a regular phantom and can inflict temporary brightness effect (similar to blindness effect but with a white light)to its target. Sleeping will make it go away but since you can’t sleep in the day time you’re stuck with it flying overhead until night approaches when you can finally sleep. Until you’ve made it to the sky dimension and slept in a bed to realize that you didn’t just explode but instead you’re just napping and cannot pass through time. Then will the player be able to take short naps in the overworld to change between sunrise, day, noon, sunset, night or and midnight. Short naps can be toggle immediately in the world creation screen with cheats enabled. Only the next two day-time options are available to sleep to. For example in my world it is currently sunrise, in that case i would only be able to nap to day or noon before the character wakes out of bed. You cannot skip whole days at a time. Daytime napping removes 2 full hunger bars, while at night you can sleep hunger free. You’re unable to nap in the day with a hunger bar less than 2. Sleeping in bed should also indicate the current time of day. A text of the time of day should also appear while holding a clock and can display on the side under day counter if &nbsp;equipped in the off hand</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Filling it up with emerald will send you back to the world spawn in the overworld with no Anchor gateway portal on the other side. Filling it up with chorus fruit will set the portal’s destination to the end connecting to either a active portal there or in a random spot away far from the main end island with an inactive gateway portal (this supports the idea to make it optional to find strongholds and beat the game in whatever order you choose as the player to form your own unique story). Filling them up with sculk catalyst activates that portal until connected with another one built in the sculked dimension. Use the corresponding blocks or items to respawn in the same dimension using the respawn anchor. Portals can be made larger by following the 2x2 format pattern, then 3x3, 4x4, 5x5 and so on, though the max portal use would still remain at 8 uses for smaller anchor portals.

Baby dragons are the only ones that players are able to tame and are spawned using the dragon egg surrounded by four blocks of obsidian with end crystals on top. Once the baby dragon grows into the mid-aged dragon without being tamed it can choose to be hostile to anything if provoked or hungry (tamed with eye of ender and eats ender pearls and can pick up any nearby to try heal itself and if full it stores them for later use if player tamed and equipped it with a chest) but still had a slight chance to be tamed. Mid-aged dragons can be spawn on any type of quartz(makes it hostile toward all mobs)or purpur(makes it hostile if provoked) blocks. Lastly the fully matured dragon, spawned in by placing end crystals on bedrock if not previously tamed it will be hostile towards everything in its path naturally the strongest being the ender dragon because of its natural surroundings to heal itself and ability to not be controlled by amethyst crystals.</p>",

Water serpents can be summoned a little differently by placing dry serpent egg inside the radius of active conduit. Water serpents are tamed with heart of the sea and can be healed or heals itself with rotten flesh (wont attack drowned unless hungry or player tamed). Water dragons avoid attacking entities hold a trident and if players are riding a tamed water serpent with riptide on their trident, rain and water aren’t needed and will have a collaborative animation and effect for both the player and serpent. For the water serpent, lava, the void and possibly acid could be detrimental. For the earth serpent, water, lava, and the void are its fatal weaknesses. A serpent formed from a mutation instead of an egg is the ender serpent. It come from splashing an endermite with the “??? potion” it is the only serpent tamed like all other dragons with eye of ender can also eat enderpearls but only ones feed to it by the player. Rivals with endermen and can ride two players, teleporting itself and the riders to wherever they throw a pearl.</p>",

Husk have been scouring the desert in search of the pharaohs heart for his return and players have the option to help. Using a brush to examine the hidden treasures in suspicious sand and gravel could pay to benefit or be the beginning of a curse. Now the ancient pharaoh’s heart can be found in suspicious sand and gravel which allows player to withstand suffocating and withering while in hand. Interact with a husk using a pharaoh’s heart to summon the Cursed Mummy mini boss. Cursed mummy’s can summon a army of the undead to their disposal with some even spawning on mounts (goes great with new mounts of mayhem). If the cursed mummy is defeated it will drop the time totem which allows player to advance 10 days without sleeping and it grows any and all nearby vegetation in a 100 block radius and at times the mummy can rarely drop a totem of undying. Time totem can also be found in suspicious sand and gravel locations at a even rarer rate. The peace keepers tome should be the rarest ancient artifacts to find in either suspicious sand or gravel. Random enhancement books should also be rare things to find in suspicions sand or gravel. Potions combined with resin to make runes would also be quite cool to find and make.</p>",

Also Legendary Wizards form of attack is ranged allowing him to summon two iron golems after a cooldown and uses shulker bullets to levitate threats sending them crashing down.

Doing this in the wrong order can cause you to create a chemical called the “??? Potion” (which initiates a random negative effect with a high chance of withering). Using multiple “ ??? Potion’s” can cause several negative effects. Using the antidote potion on amethyst armor can protect from any negative effect damage as long as it’s timer is greater than the negative one, but if it is lower, then the negative one will have a greater effect until the player drinks milk or another antidote potion is used (great for saving passive mobs with negative effects). Milk cannot be made into splash or lingering potions, only bottled. Milk cannot stop potential sculk effects while antidote potions can.&nbsp;</p>",
