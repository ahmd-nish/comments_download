Just,the reason I think they should run out of fuel is because that was gonna happen in the Halloween Update that added the Nether,but it wasn't added. But I think it would make Minecraft a bit more realistic and challenging. The same with lighting up in hand but instead of being challenging,it would make it a bit easier. Though I'd think using it in hand would also burn fuel. Perhaps another way though of losing fuel is making it waterlogged,in which case you'd need to dry the torch,perhaps by putting it in a furnace. And now to think about it,yeah,that would also solve the cheating of drowning,but also give the game a bit of difficulty as you can't use torches in water...I like it. I would edit the post,but it could be taken down when pending,so...</p>",

Possibility to add new plants and trees. Can be given to creepers for some kind of change??\n<br />Also have a new weather effect: Ashy snow.\n<br />It does the same thing as snow layers but its ash and it can be done by volcanoes. If enough ash has been gathered you can harvest it.  A new gravity block and that can be used in crafting and interacts with the environment * it can also be like snow layers*.\n<br />Coulf add ashy wood. Gives 3 blocks instead of 4 and has a burned texture and colour. \n<br />The mountains dont have to be black, they can have different types like real mountains. Have plants regrow after a while? Could add an ash mob to make it more fun. If you are wearing armournin these biomes you start to feel nausueas and hot, starting to take damage. Need to be in them with leather clothes.  If it starts raining when there was an erruption have acidic rain that damages the player every 30 seconds and does damage to his armour?\n<br />I really want these types of biome and i think this is the time for them to be added. A lot of fun, challenging and for all players. Adventures, redstone players, builders etc. :))\n</p>",

I believe the Warden and Deep Dark should be their own gameplay features and should not interfere with other existing structures in the game. The Warden is extremely strong and terrifying, and the one sensible choice you have while exploring the Deep Dark is to stealth (you can try to brute force it, but you will certainly die). If you don't want to stealth or take the risk, you should be able to carry out with the rest of the game normally and avoid the Deep Dark as a whole, but then you will not have access to the cool loot and features that lie there. If the Warden spawns in Strongholds, the game would be practically forcing people to stealth and experience the Warden while they really want to experience a completely different aspect of the game (the Ender Dragon). Besides, the challenge should not really be in the Stronghold, it should be in the End that is beyond the Stronghold.</p>",
