        "body": "<p>Minecraft dungeons staff,</p>\n<p>We all know how much Minecraft dungeons has evolved and there have been some complaints from the players side. We request few features that would help make Minecraft dungeons better, The staff has gifted Minecraft dungeons players the multiplayer tower event that has made minecraft dungeons a better game. Another update we would like to have to improve the quality of the multiplayer aspect of the game will be lobbies. Minecraft dungeons is supposed to be a cross-platform game that is meant to played with friends, but due to the game slowly declining in popularity we request a feature that lets us join public lobbies so other players can join and just go through levels together. If they dont want to play with online players they can switch of their lobby and play by the own. I personally think this would be an amazing idea for the game as now people will be able to play online and explore with other adventures, Thank you</p>",

After that u have price for random gilded effect as 750-1000 new currency for a random and 1000-1500 to choice ur gilded effect.The other idea is to make the impossible difficult to to increase ur enhancement up to 5 to 10 level. at Demi god difficulty u can combine max level enhancement together to make new random enhancement and add a special attack.&nbsp; True god difficulty the enhancement are not random and add random domain enhancements . High&nbsp; God and preak god difficulty are like system impossible to true difficulty but with domin enhancement instead&nbsp;</p>",
