It has chests in most of the temples surrounding the center temple. Each temple has a painting of what it was used for. The center temple has the best loot from new types of enchantments to a sorcerer staff. The center temple also has a painting about what the city was who was the chief/ruler and what caused the city to become abandoned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The sorcerer's staff is used to enhance the shadow core. With the staff in the players off hand and the shadow core in their main hand, the player becomes a shadow for a short amount. As a shadow the player can move through blocks and fly but they can't go into light if they do the shadow core begins to crack. If the core is cracked completely the player will have to fight a mini boss known as the shadow or something shadow related. This boss also takes damage from light. The sorcerer staff makes this fight less difficult, it allows the player to teleport, it creates a lime green light source, a small force field, regain health slowly, shoot lime green fire balls, and trap the boss into a any block, but this can only be done when the boss is at low health, if the block is easily broken then the shadow has a higher chance of escaping once the shadow is captured the player receives a tainted block that they shouldn't break or destroy unless they'd like to fight that shadow again.</p>",
