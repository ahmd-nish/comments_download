If it was added, maybe make it so that way it can only be crafted after beating the ender dragon from a stronghold portal, then along with the XP the dragon drops it would also drop the items needed to craft the portal, as if it had it with it so that it could take over the overworld. Not only would the portal be useful, but I think it would be fun to see what crazy ideas people think of about why the dragon had these on it.</p>",

I was thinking of Lush Caves generation slightly more commonly on hot (temperature) biomes because of lore and other stuff, mostly the jungle I would consider. But since this suggestion is something completely different, I decided to continue this Suggestion on Creepers instead of changing it. I will change this suggestion but retaining the Creeper, the Lush Cave theme and the original suggestion. I personally think Creepers should slightly more spawn on blocks where Spore Blossoms emit their green spore particles. If the Spore Blossoms is emitting it from a Lush Cave related block, it will also slightly increase the Creeper spawn chance on the block.</p>",

        "body": "<p>They didn't make them much slower at all. You're exaggerating it WAY too much. It is only a decrease from 30 to 26 blocks per second, and it only applies to firework rocket boosting, which you should only really be using to gain height and avoid landing, otherwise you're doing it inefficiently. Besides, combined with the durability change this actually gives strategic value for flight duration 2 and 3 rockets which were virtually useless before. Now durability is taken away based on rocket use, with -3 points taken with any rocket regardles of flight duration. This means if you're travelling long distances, it's optimal to use higher flight durations so that you can keep launching further without depleting as much durability. The decreased firework speed balances out the fact that Elytra durability is now more optimal, which is needed due to the new world generation with the highly varying elevations. Gliding without fireworks (a technique whose speed was not affected) will now become a much more valid option for travelling during regular gameplay with the new caves and elevated terrain, meaning that fireworks are not as needed anyway now for speed and having them as fast as they were would just make it a tad too overpowered with the new generation. Besides, it does help with performance provided you're using fireworks wisely and not just spamming. I've noticed people travelling further than I'm used to seeing without bumping into unloaded chunks. It's subtle yet helpful.</p>",

Why?! What gameplay purpose does any of this serve??? It's just very complicated to implement and to comprehend, and I don't see much value to it besides flexing with an above void base. It'll just mostly be annoying and take away height from the underground that it definitely needs.</p>",
