It reminds me of the recipes to create andesite, granite, and diorite from cobblestone and quartz; those recipes are great because they provide an alternative, albeit expensive way to craft blocks that some players may not have easy access to, if their world was created before the Bountiful Update (1.8). This suggestion is quite similar in that regard.</p>\n<p>One nice thing about using amethyst in the recipes is that it forces players to find at least one geode before they can craft the blocks. That way, the blocks are still somewhat exclusive to the geode, but once you find one, it's possible (albeit expensive) to get as many of those blocks as you want through farming the crystals that grow there.</p>\n<p>I imagine that calcite and tuff will both end up being quite popular in some building styles, and having them be craftable with amethyst would give a big reason to keep returning to the geodes to farm crystals.</p>",
