To make it, you need a stick and you need to go to the Nether to get these nether shards, then head back home. At home, you use a crafting table to craft the wand. Craft the wand by putting all the nether shards around and a stick in the middle. Then you get out and you have the wand.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">At first the wand will not do anything and then if you have level 30, you can enchant it. Then with the enchanted wand you can shoot fireballs, maybe you could throw mobs in the air and it takes some damage, and maybe you could throw fire snowballs instead that does seven attack damage, when you throw a mob in the air it does nine attack damage, and you can poison a mob and they will have half a heart. If you poison the boss, it won’t leave them at half a heart it’ll still have a lot of hearts but the enchanted wand can still do a little bit of damage.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, you can have an invisible shield for 20 seconds and when the shield goes away you’ll have to have a five minute warm-up and you will have a little timer on the side and it will tell you when you could use it again.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">I think it would be a fun thing to try out!</span></p>",
