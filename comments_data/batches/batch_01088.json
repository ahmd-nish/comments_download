Perhaps 4 points of health (2 hearts) would be the max. Perhaps food like steak wouldn't heal anything at all. Even in the above example I made sure it didn't heal a ridiculous amount.</p>\n<p>3. They could always nerf heath restore via saturation.</p>\n<p>4. They could always buff instant health potions. Four hearts after standing still for what feels like forever isn't the most optimal fighting strategy. There's no reason not to use the splash potions.</p>\n<p>5. If it somehow IS as overpowered as you imply, they could always re-balance it.</p>\n<p>If that's the only reason you haven't voted, I implore you to reconsider.</p>",

All recipes that can't be described by the recipe book are being&nbsp;moved to a new block so that new players can better understand what's going on. THAT'S IT.
