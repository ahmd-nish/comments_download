Below you will find a transcription of the topic being discussed. <br><br><strong>Title:</strong> “Transport using Ghast” <br><br><strong>Text:</strong> “In the Nether, Ghast is not so useful (except for your tears that we can use to make potions) and I wondered, and could we use a Ghast as a means of transportation? We could use rotten meat to tame it and so put a saddle on it because the strider only walks through the lava and if we wanted to go to a place that is above a sea of lava for example a fortress, would it be impossible? We could use Ghast to go there without having to bridge it, which would be very dangerous in this situation. That was my suggestion thanks ;-) I love your game !!!”</p>\n<p>- Translated by Admin</p>",
