Perhaps crocodiles could be hostile and if slain could drop scales which could be used to craft armour or maybe used in potions and maybe even teeth which could be used in crafting weapons or tools or etc. However, I know Mojang and Microsoft don’t like adding endangered animals that drop loot to the game so perhaps they could be passive. Although in my opinion this doesn’t really fit our perception of them so maybe a mob that looks and acts similarly to crocodiles could be added with a sort of “mythical spin” that separates them from regular crocodiles. You could have different varieties like saltwater crocodiles in dessert rivers and maybe oasis’s if they could also be added to the game you could also have a size range that includes dwarf caimans going all the way up to the giant crocodiles found in the nile and Australia etc. you could also possibly add alligators as a further example of bio-diversity.</p>",

Unlike dolphins, they do this for no benefit to themselves, simply out of the kindness of their hearts. Like basking sharks, they do not eat fish, and will simply feed on plankton. If they sink your boat, it is by accident.
