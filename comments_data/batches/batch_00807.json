        "body": "<p>I'm really happy about the changes to peaks. They look even more dramatic and jagged than those on Bedrock. I can say from what I've seen that their overall structure and form is the closest it needs to be to how it is on Bedrock. It would be nice for the peaks to be a very tiny bit smoother than it currently is, since the extreme jaginess can make it jarring in some places; a bit of smoothness can make it more natural. I also think that the new peaks should be more likely to appear at the \"very high altitude\" range, above Y=200. Though they definitely look very dramatic regardless of actual height, being more towards the &gt;200 range would provide more space for the other mountain sub-biomes to often generate below the peak biomes like they do on Bedrock. I noticed that there is only space for either a Mountain Grove or a Snowy Slope to generate below the peaks in most cases. It still looks great, but appearing more often in the higher ranges would allow Snowy Slopes to generate in between the Lofty Peaks and Mountain Groves, making the new peaky mountains more snowy on average. 1/2</p>",

The surrounding biomes should definitely still be able make up parts of the mountain base, and in the case of Tundras a Meadows biome wouldn't work. So there would still be variation. Of course Stony Peaks are a different story, as they are hotter peaks intended to top biomes like Savannahs and Jungles, so a Meadows (which is a cold biome) wouldn't be need there. 2/2</p>",

It's so beautiful now, it makes me want to explore the world for hours!\n<br />There are only 2 things I would like to see changed in future snapshots: </p>\n\n<p>-Slightly tone down the rougness of the new mountain tops.\n<br /> I absolutly love the new steepy and jagged peaks, but I often see a lot of very thin, unnatural stone \"spikes\" on the top. In my opinion a little smaller in quantity, but thicker and triangle-shaped peaks would look better and more realistic.</p>\n\n<p>-Make the tallest mountains a bit more common.\n<br /> I know mojang wants to keep the tallest mountains rare, but in my opinion they're too rare at the moment. Their rarity makes them difficult to find even while using commands. I would love to enjoy the new features on survival, so even rare biomes should be accesible at some point. </p>\n\n<p>That's all what I'd like to see changed.\n<br />However I have some suggestions on future features:</p>\n\n<p>-Add snowy giant spruce taiga. \n<br />  I love how now Giant taigas often generate surrounded by cold, snowy biomes, so why not add a snowy version? Normal taiga already has It's snowy variant, \n<br />so Giant spruce taiga would be happy to get one too!</p>\n\n<p>-Add all variants of dripstone.\n<br />  The Dripstone block at the moment is only a decoration, \n<br />and going to dripcaves is pointless, so all kinds of dripstone blocks would be cool.</p>\n\n<p>-More uses for amethyst! \n<br /> Geodes are pretty rare, so finding one should provide a few more possibilities than just making a scope.\n</p>",

The only real issues I see with the world generation is with the biome placement. <br><br>The biggest issue is the weird placement of mountain biomes. For example, I may find a small, maybe 50 block patch of lofty peaks on the side of a jungle mountain. <br><br>Another issue that I have is that there aren't smooth transitions between snowy and non snowy areas. Having a plains biome at the base of a mountain with no snow and maybe 5 blocks up there's deep snow is very jarring, to say the least. <br><br>My suggestion would be to maybe completely decouple snow generation from the mountain biomes (I'm not sure about how this would work with snow biomes), and instead use snow as a decoration layer. This could also lead to some interesting terrain such as snowy meadows and forests if the conditions were permitting.</p>",

The tiered subterranean lakes / aquifers and balance the prevalence of <em>lush</em> and <em>dripstone</em> biomes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'd also be curious about \"temperature\" worldgen, under world type. Hypothetically, one could select \"cold\", \"hot\" or \"temperate\" at the options screen. Generation would then favor biomes under the specified temperature scale. So, \"cold\" generation would have taiga, tundra, ice spikes, peaks, giant spruce, etc, more commonly than dessert or savannah.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm really happy, overall, but the subterranean worldgen changes since snapshot 2 have been lackluster in comparison to that snapshot. The overworld generation itself, however, with the mountain and river changes, continue to impress.&nbsp;</p>",

I think the caves are near perfect right now so I will just mention my feedback on the overworld terrain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Mountains that go above 200 blocks are extremely rare. They should be a lot easier to find but still relatively uncommon. The peaks should also be a bit more common because they're also really rare. The actual new mountain biome rarity is fine.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-The limit in which the terrain can go should increase to 280 blocks instead of 256.</p>\n<p>-Most of the new mountains feel just like a small elevated snowy tundra/stone shore blob rather than an actual mountain. This ties in with the previous point that mountains should be a lot taller but also larger in length and width, similar to the bedrock edition.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-The blobs of dirt and gravel should be completely removed in the lofty peaks and stony peaks to match the bedrock edition, in which no dirt spawns in those biomes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Snowcapped peaks should also be mixed with the peaky terrain, just like in the bedrock edition. Note, I'm not saying they should also be peaky like the lofty peaks but they should mix inside that type of terrain to make a nice contrast.</p>\n<p>-Make Azalea trees not be able to spawn in the middle of the ocean.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Bring back the obsidian and magma block ravines in the ocean that were added in the update aquatic.</p>\n<p>-Make small islands in the ocean a bit more common.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It looks odd, and doesn't make sense. In real life water freezes from land first and moves inward.</p>\n<p>Another thing that happens in real life is rivers, or river systems, flow into lakes and oceans. This is true for all river systems in real life, wherever you look. Here in snapshot 5 you can have rivers generating in the middle of big land masses, or mountains, with no exit body. Like the frozen river, this doesn't make sense. Not only that, it would be intuitive while exploring to follow a river and find an ocean. It only makes sense, not just from a real life perspective but from a gameplay one as well, to bind rivers to a source body of water. So I would love to see a change like this made. Deltas and estuaries would be pretty cool to see as well.</p>\n<p>Rivers also start from elevated areas. I don't wish for headwaters as much as I do for rivers meeting oceans, especially because water level is mostly consistent across the board, but mountain waterfalls would be a cool way to start headwaters to sort of reflect real life a bit more. And given this update involves mountains and things relating, it makes sense too.</p>",

I'd much rather the whole thing be stony peaks. Maybe add gravel/andesite slopes to combat this? One other thing would be to slightly reduce the amount of water springs in mountains often there are too many and it ends up very messy. Also the intial world generation seems kind of buggy. It fixes itself in time but intially the chunks gen really slowly and tend to pop in and out of existence.</p>",

The new peaks are awesome, but sometimes it is way too spiky. I think just a slight tone down would be perfect.</p>\n<p>- Ground variant for glow berries. Add them to lush cave generation. In bigger lush caves, the top is lit up and the bottom is completely dark. This looks a little bit odd, and could be solved by adding a ground variant.</p>\n<p>- Raise the overall height of mountains to make room for lower mountain biomes as well as being able to find cool mountains more often. Right now, they are very difficult to find without /locatebiome.</p>\n<p>Thank you for the amazing update and game! &lt;3</p>",

When you're in a really large cavern you can see the fog far away, which is white, this looks unnatural in the darkness of caves, and I can see this being a big issue if not addressed since many of us will likely need to turn our render distances down.</p>\n<p>To solve the problem I think the fog should be black when you are underground. Once you start going deeper than some small distance below sea level the fog should start getting darker in colour becoming completely black by the time you reach deepslate. It might also be useful to have this dependent on the amount of skylight the player is standing in so the fog only darkens if the player is significantly below sea level and not standing in skylight.</p>\n<p>Another possible option would be to have the fog be a gradient with the shade being dependent on the y coordinates, instead of a solid colour.</p>",

It's gonna be fun for at least 80% of people, trust me. If you really don't like stealth, then just avoid the Deep Dark as a whole; it's not the place for you (1000 IQ move right there). Not every gameplay aspect needs to be enjoyed by/fit the playstyle of every player in the world. If you don't like combat, you wouldn't go to the End would you? How many players don't like combat? Very few indeed. Similarly if you don't like mining, you just don't mine. You would miss out on things like Copper, Amethyst, Glow Lichen, Raw Ores, and a ton more, so wouldn't you want to do it anyway for the rewards? Don't ruin the gameplay experience for others who want to stealth and get that first night effect revived for them, but will just normally go for the easier options that kill all of the fear and impact the Deep Dark is meant to have, all just because you don't personally like stealth.</p>",
