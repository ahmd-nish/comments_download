Which it just being visual is completely useless since dispensers can shoot fireworks faster and with less cost. The crossbow was my absolute favorite feature in 1.14 and seeing it as it is now In Bedrock compared to it's functionality and versatility in Java is downright upsetting and I think was just result of laziness from the developers.

UNTIL IT IS READY FOR RELEASE. 1.14.0 was \"not ready for release.\" That is pretty clear and obvious to many of the Minecraft Java Edition players. Demanding 1.14 to release when Bedrock was ready was a huge mistake that is a great disservice to Realm players, who can not choose what version, to Modders and Server ops, with an audience demanding a release that wasn't fit to release, to new players picking up Minecraft for the first time only to be stunned and amazed at how shoddy 1.14.0 was. DO NOT release before it's ready. I'm begging you. Just... don't. But otherwise, having the same \"updates\" in the same rough time-frame is cool.</p>",

It doesn’t make sense for a person that knows the crafting recipes to have to unlock them all again. So the unlocking recipes should be relative to the account and not to each world, similar to how the achievements currently work on Bedrock. That way once a player has learned a recipe, they also have that recipe available in the other worlds, and that for someone who has played hundreds of Minecraft worlds, doesn’t have to search for materials just to see the recipe for something they’ve crafted before.</p>",

The recipes being shared across worlds would also fix a few other issues, since after playing with recipes for a while it became clear that this is aimed at newer players. I think quick crafting is one of the best features, but the recipe unlock system has requirements that interrupt it and the flow of gameplay. I have to actually touch water be able to quick craft a boat or just wait a few minutes to be able to quick craft a chest. I know I can just craft them manually but it is unnecessary and interrupts usual gameplay. Worst of all, unlocking a new recipe resets the crafting table setting, which means I have to press craftable, my preferred setting, every time after I unlock something new. This also happens every single time I load into a world. Making it so that recipes are shared across worlds would make this bug less painful to deal with, since I doubt it will be fixed soon if it wasn't caught and fixed during tests. A toggle for recipes could also work, since I would much rather not have recipe unlocks than have to deal with the crafting table setting reset bug every time I load into a world.</p>",

It's a pointless \"progression\" that wants to be added due to Java parity, it would make sense for Java to copy Bedrock with its all-unlocked recipes style. I believe the original idea was taken from Legacy Edition where everything was unlocked, and boy, it was such a life-saver to quickly smash a few buttons then fight off a creeper mid-way through. I just wouldn't be able to do that on a new world. I mean, what does feature even add? Most players just ignore it when it appears on the top-right corner so it doesn't even serve purpose.

And if you get annoyed by the recipe suggestion toasts, then there can simply be an accessibility option to turn them off. Feel like this is the simplest solution.</p>\n<p>Basically keeping the notifications (and making them optional), but not gating functionality behind them (but if you do want to, then there can be gamerules for that, such as the doLimitedCrafting gamerule on Java)</p>\n<p>The main thing I really like about recipe unlocks is teaching players about new things they can craft once they get an appropriate item or are in an appropriate context. I do not really mind how it is currently implemented but I can understand why people are upset because it is basically taking away functionality from the recipe book until you unlock the recipes. Also, as the feature stands right now, it is not optional, which some players do want.</p>",

They need to increase the difficulty the same way java does by decreasing the power of your weapons. Ive noticed that alot java is so much better balanced as far as weapon strength and mob health goes. Ive been a console gamer for years and i just got a computer and am able to play java edition now. I noticed right away how much better of a game it is all around. Bedrock sucks in so many ways . More effort needs to go towards making bedrock more like java edition. </p>",
