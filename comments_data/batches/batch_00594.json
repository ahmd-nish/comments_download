I'm just providing a possible solution to:</p>\n<p>1) Give the game a more integrated blacksmith aspect, which could relate to the blacksmith and Fletcher villagers and their corresponding blocks (which currently have no use)</p>\n<p>2) give more purpose to using leather and gold. Again leather is useless as armor to the point that I don't even bother making them I just wait for iron to make armor. Gold is pretty much useless, unless you're making apples or powered rails. instead of asking for new items I simply want to give more use to the ones available.</p>\n<p>3) Give a personal touch and more options in how you decide to make your own armor and tool sets, by the time everyone in a world has diamonds, everyone is just wearing blue armor and that's it.</p>\n<p>My main point is that lower tier items become obsolete too fast, instead of them just being weaker version of diamonds they could add effects or different stats to your equipment specially when you add mod drops to the mix, rotten flesh could add a poison effect to weapons, wither roses a wither effect (that last as long as the flower itself, could be enhanced with emeralds or something).</p>\n<p>As for the gold I'm aware that gold is a dense metal lol, I was just going by the fact that gold has already a higher efficiency than diamond, so I was just going from that. The items don't exactly have to follow the manner as I proposed them. I'm more interested in the tier system and customization. Considering that a big aspect of Minecraft is the \"Build your own world\" aspect I don't see how the items themself can't reflect that.</p>\n<p>If you like the idea what would you change to make it more appealing to everyone?&nbsp;</p>",
