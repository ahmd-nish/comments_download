I know this was recently worked on, but I hope there is still room to improve.</li>\n<li>Maybe add the functionality to use desktop shortcuts. So the shortcut that is displayed in the launcher can also be placed on your desktop. This wood makes it even faster and easier to launch in the world or server you want.</li>\n<li>At the moment, you cannot edit the game version that the world is using. I think it would be very helpful, especially if a new version came out so that you could edit the version set for the world shortcut. For example, if the new 1.20.2 update comes out, you will need to completely change all your pins and icons. A new menu similar to the installation tab could be very helpful.</li>\n</ol>",

Then, recently they added Quick Launch option which gives me the ability to pin the world to the top right of the launcher but it's still 4 loading screens away. Minecraft Launcher loading, you click on pinned world and it says Preparing in the bottom #2, then it goes to desktop and after a while it opens a small window and switches to red Mojang screen loading #3 and lastly your world loads which is #4. This is on SSD too.</p>\n<p>Quick Launch is a step in the right direction but we need better and quicker loading into our worlds in my opinion. Is there a way to do that currently? Maybe also allow us to put a shortcut of the world(s) to the desktop too?</p>",

        "body": "<p>Just checked out the new home page and it definitely could use some work. I’ll start with what I personally liked the top part of the screen with the quick play features are nice but could be a little bigger/Bolder. The thumbsnails/look for articles looks better in the old launcher. It just looks cleaner what can I say i’m a sucker for nice big thumbnails. If the articles are going to have a short description under the thumbnail it should be its own separate summary rather then just the beginning text of the article it would just be more visually appealing without them in my opinion. Snapshots and previews should be separated from other Minecraft News and articles since right now they clutter the bottom part of the launcher and a clear distinction between a snapshot/preview article and a Minecraft news/community one. Now as for my suggested features. A Community page or forums would be a nice addition similar to minecraft chinas Launcher. Minecraft could use a nice place to interact and see what’s trending in the game. A place with direct access to the feedback page. Server list with top/featured servers. Weekly showcases of minecraft art/ community creations would also be super fun and cool. The Launcher could be a nice platform for the minecraft community but I know the implications that comes with and how difficult it could be to implement. Glad to see your guys are thinking about updating the launcher hope to see more!</p>",

Two things I would like to point out is that firstly (not sure if this is fully added) but most of the images in the launcher are kinda pixelated than the original image and sometimes if the image is too small then it would stretch it? also secondly the play button should be a bit bigger as the button can skip the new players eyes and think one of the posts is the play button it should be a bigger so the player can notice it otherwise the java edition should load in first (if the home menu is going first when this comes out)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Otherwise I love this new addition to the launcher its makes it way better than having to find the posts on the website. it gives the launcher's post display areas (under the game) more purpose and feel more homely!</p>\n<p><br>Thank you have a good day!</p>",

The biggest draw of Java Edition is the bottomless amount of mods. Shame on me for not having a PC &amp; video card. Bedrock should get access to free mods. And another thing, if you're making mods expecting to get paid, there's absolutely no way I'd buy any of those mods.

I'm not sure if I worded this right but basically look at any other game with a similar box and you'll understand. Also, I feel like the little boxes to the right could use some improvement. They should be a bit bigger/wider and should constantly show the title, not only when it scrolls to it. Also, I feel like a brief description would be nice instead of just a title. Maybe the first paragraph or something?</p>",

However, there are some ideas I suggest you look into:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The centered layout of the Quick Play / Play Minecraft buttons is great and brand new. However, these buttons are way too small compared to the rest of the home page. The text in the version button is barely readable. It needs to be upsized.</li>\n<li>The font has been the same, shifted off from the Java/Bedrock pages, but I think it would be a great time to use a more Minecraft-y font in some more places. Currently it's only used for large titles, but it should be used at least a bit more.</li>\n<li>The new sidebar showing more news needs a lot of work. The description texts need to be much smaller so that the entire description is visible. And it has to be centered - it's currently at the top of the box and isn't as visually pleasing.</li>\n<li>Add more animations! When shifting from one sidebar news to another, make the news at least slide from one to another, or even fade. It's abrupt when it moves from one to another so suddenly.</li>\n<li>Last, rename Minecraft for Windows into Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. It makes no sense - we have three more playable Minecraft games in Windows, and it will also fit in nicely with Minecraft: Java Edition.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, as for my suggested features, it would be great if you added tabs for easier, direct access to the Minecraft Feedback Website (feedback.minecraft.net), Bug Report Website (bugs.minecraft.net), and Help Center (help.minecraft.net). This may be enough.</p>",

I can personally say that although people no read MC news the don't do it very often and unless there is a snapshot or a major update. I like that the quickplay screen looks better but having the play button next to it and all the icons being incredibly small is kind of bad. The way the normal launcher has the play button is much better. The news panel at the bottom is better but it would be better if there was some space between the play button are and news because that just looks so much cleaner.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All in all, its a decent concept btu with a little bit of work here and there to make it clutter free and easy to use I would gladly have this become my default homepage,&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Also the big text box is too big in my opinion, make it be like a pop-up as a notification like as if you got an error, and add a bit of texture into the \"PLAY\" button, looks kinda bad when its just bland white.

It would be really nice to be able to hide everything for editions I will never play.</p>\n<p>2. Don't care about Quick Play either. I turned it off pretty quickly after it was introduced. I am perfectly capable of selecting the game I want from a list.</p>\n<p>3. In the existing Launcher, the Play button is nice and large. And the currently selected game version is easy to see and change. In the new home page, these are much smaller and it's difficult to see which version is going to be launched. I have active games in several different versions and I need to be able to see which one is selected when I'm looking at the launcher. There's no reason for the buttons to be so squashed together. There is plenty of room for them.</p>\n<p>For me, the old version is better.&nbsp;</p>",

I found the launcher back in 2018 way more intuitive, cleaner, faster and overall more useful displaying different photos of each update that came out right on the home screen, a big green play button with the arrow to switch versions. That's all we need. The rest is pretty much unnecessary and the quick launch, that let's you switch between your worlds through the launcher is just one or two clicks removed, completely useless. Give us an option to customize the launcher to our liking, if we want older styled launchers let us make it like that. If e want the 2018, or even the Legacy launcher ui let us choose that! The new launcher just isn't productive and the stupid existence of the other Minecraft rip offs without owing them on the side bar is just terrible. Fix up your launcher, for now I'm switching to OLauncher because of this.</p>",

I wanted to give my feedback about it so here i am, telling you what noticed was wrong/could be better as a&nbsp; regular user of this beloved launcher :</p>\n<p>- The page doesn't scroll when my mouse is on the left side of the page, where all the Minecraft games icons are.</p>\n<p>-The pictures (besides the \"new home page\" one) are a bit pixelised/480p styled</p>\n<p>-The new snapshots/releases changelogs's pictures are at the wrong quality ratio (streched)</p>\n<p>-A \"wiki\" button to open the wiki directly in the launcher without going through an internet browser would be very useful.</p>\n<p>-Just a detail but i think the \"Minecraft: Java Edition\" and \"Patch Note\" pins on the news could be a little smaller/less noticeable because they look a bit too large/in the wrong place. I would personally put them further down the rectangles.<br><br>Anyway thank you again for bringing us such amazing features in the games and all the applications/websites/etc related to it !</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I do like how the page displays the changing screens, but on the bottom left of the screens the description could be a little bit smaller. The little pause button for the screens is a cool little feature as well. I especially like the new way the different news and patch notes are with the image, the description, date, and the color coded categories saying what version(Java, Bedrock, Windows, etc.) it is and whether it is news or a patch note. I like the search bar and filters that the new homepage offers as well for the different news updates. I don't really like that the buttons on the left of the PLAY button at the top go straight to your world and I don't really think it's necessary. What could go there rather than the different worlds that you play on could be the latest used of the different installations that are on your computer for that version of Minecraft(Java, Bedrock, Windows, etc.). On the right of the PLAY button could be just the version of Minecraft(Java, Bedrock, Windows, etc.) rather than having the installations there too. I do think that those things with the play button would add something to the aesthetics of the screen as well. Overall though, I really like it. Keep up the good work. Thanks!</p>",

I tried to read them once, but they were completely uninteresting and useless. So remove them from there. If I need to, I will go to your site and read them. There is no need to FORCE them on me.

For example, if MCPE 0.4 was put up, the versions other than pocket would have to have working blocks for the Stonecutter and the creation of the cyan flower, along with nether reactor support. Another thing is that they would not be able to have the exact same menu, as Bedrock has the option to switch from keyboard to touch to controller, while mcpe 0.4 only has touch enabled, so a way to fix that problem is to decide the device when you open the launcher. I do feel this is a great idea, and it would be really great if they did create this, especially if they could add older PE edition support</p>",

If you click the button then there will be menu where you can select all Bedrock versions back to 1.2 in the first version you could play&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;multi-platform. Then Minecraft would reload and bring you to the old title screen in that Minecraft version. If you wanted to go back to the new version you would reload the game. I think this would be great!

Maybe it's because I'm on android, but I seriously don't see a point in having a launcher, not even for most other games I play.

I don't need a fanfare about games I don't have, and in fact can't run on my main (Linux) computer, every time I try to play.</p>\n<p>On that note, I'm still interested in a JVM-based launcher so I can enjoy Minecraft's true cross-platform capabilities. I used to be able to run it off a USB stick on any OS or architecture I wanted. Now I have to have a special launcher per OS that doesn't work on all architectures and I question the long-term Linux support.</p>",

I am tired of not being able to fix a problem because I can not go back a few versions. On top of that, when ever I uninstall Minecraft bedrock edition, usually to fix an issue with the game or to roll back out of the beta, it deletes my worlds. Really sucks that some of my long term worlds are just gone now. Of course, I have learned to back up every single world before reinstalling Minecraft, but that does not take away from annoying this process is to go through.</p>",

This would not only allow players to play their preferred version of the game (update or platform) from one central hub, but it would also allow for new players to see just how far the game has progressed thus far, especially while granting them the nostalgic feel of playing through all of the tutorial worlds which as was stated before is a highly demanded feature that players have been hoping would return.</p>",

A launcher for BE (at least for the Pocket Edition and Windows 10 devices; I don't know if it can be done on consoles) would be amazing.\n<br />The main thing I find it useful for is for playing older versions of Minecraft, since the only way to do that on phones at the moment is to jailbreak your phone or sideload the old IPA/APK file in (which both can cause problems regarding safety, your phone's warranty, etc.), and having a launcher, or some other way to switch game versions, could eliminate this problem. \n<br />Another solution is to use the IPA/APK files mentioned earlier.  There could be another app (it can be paid for or come with the Minecraft app), which allows you to install the IPA for whichever version you want.  This would allow you to have multiple versions downloaded at the same time, but probably wouldn't work because there are so many versions, each requiring their own file, and Mojang may not have access to those old files.  Mojang would also need to sign the IPAs (for Apple devices) to let people use them.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, a launcher or some way to switch game versions would be incredible, but sadly may not be possible if Mojang does not have access to the old versions of the game (they could use the files that the community has, but I highly doubt they would).</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in other places on this site, the launcher would allow you to join servers that run on specific versions, and would also allow you to test things like redstone and technical things in old versions.</p>",

The game, to me, doesn't set new or returning players up for success without aid of external guides.</p>\n\n<p>Tutorial worlds gave new or returning players a space to learn and use new features from an update, but also features which have changed since last playing and to become exposed to all of the key features of minecraft in an interactive manner. When I was a new player on Console editions, the pop-up dialogue tutorials and all the necessary resources being nearby allowed me to experiment with brewing, trading, Redstone, building a nether portal, and other features that are considered mid or late game. \n<br />The builds that the developers make in these worlds can also inspire builds that players may attempt in their own survival world. </p>\n\n<p>An example of a feature that many players use, but is not fundamentally taught in-game, is building a nether portal. Currently, new players need to explore a world and find a broken nether portal and deduce the basic shape of the portal, that there are other dimensions, that gold is important/common in said dimension, and that the portal must be lit with an included flint and steel. \n<br />To figure out all these things seems less likely than said new player thinking, \"this is a weird and cool structure.\" This will probably lead the player to find external tutorials on the nether portal. A tutorial world can solve this issue by having a tutorial for players to learn in-game.</p>\n\n<p>These are my thoughts anyways.</p>",
