Primarily, the crafting recipe should be tweaked to provided more, probably 24 instead of 16 per recipe to accommodate for iron being less / harder to obtain. The other method though should be the addition of copper rails, which is so prevalent in the world now that it's practically worthless, though that is what would make it a perfect alternative for rails since iron is more rare.</p>\n<p>I agree that copper rails should oxidize over time and slow the minecart, and I like the idea that frequently using the copper rails will prevent/scrape oxidization, though I don't think its a good idea to exclude waxing the rails. Seems like a good trade-off to either use wax to prevent oxidization, which can be hard to obtain without a good bee farm, or to frequently ride the rails to have the same effect, which can require a lot of time.</p>\n<p>Another idea could be to differentiate the iron and copper rails; iron rails could be medium speed (12 m/s) but would have more momentum, which would require less powered rails to maintain speed; alternatively copper rails could be faster (16 m/s) but would have less momentum, requiring more frequent powered rails, and require maintenance, either through frequent usage or waxing, to prevent oxidization and slowing the cart to 6 m/s in the green state. Seems like a good trade-off to me. And powered rails wouldn't have momentum, but a constant speed of 20 m/s if used continously.</p>",

I agree there should be another new rail type, though instead I think it should be another form of powered rail created with netherite; It is a material produced through gold, so logically the progression makes sense, and it is harder to obtain, which would explain the faster speed. If we followed the idea of the gold powered rails, this new rail type would also have zero momentum, requiring a constant track of them, but instead would go 30 m/s, essentially capping out the minecart speed and practically going super-sonic in the game.</p>\n<p>Your idea for lightning rails could instead be a natural effect of the copper rails. placing a lighting rod next to the rails would attract lightning and have the side effect of super-charging the copper rails to reach 20 m/s, but it would require chance, right place at the right time during a lightning storm.</p>\n<p>I love the idea of using a detector rail + comparator to produce different redstone signals as well based on the speed of the minecart. 30 m/s = 15 redstone, 20 m/s = 10, 16 m/s = 8, 12 m/s = 6, so on until 6 m/s = 2 or 3 redstone signal. Alternatively, a detector rail without a comparator would emit a redstone signal of 15 regardless of speed. This would be a very interesting mechanic for redstoners in the MC community I think.</p>",
