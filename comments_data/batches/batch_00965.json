I promise you it's worth the effort<br><br>A lot of things in Minecraft is about weighing the pros and cons. Do you use iron for a pick or a bucket? Do you give the wheat to the sheep or the cows? More famously, do you use an elytra or use a chestplate? An elytra gives air mobility while a chestplate gives defense. Netherite armor gives you stronger tools and armor that are fire resistant BUT it's rare and highly expensive to repair normally, encouraging you to find alternatives (only using netherite when in the nether or getting mending).&nbsp;</p>",

How do we start a fire on stone with only flint and steel?<br>I understand your point but the physics of a game can't be perfect nor applied to every small detail, otherwise it would become to complexe to play and players wouldn't play anymore (for that we have real life xD).<br>From what is already ingame, if an entity goes through fire set from flint and steel on stone, it will catch fire. It is how it is and it works, it's simple, great.<br>What we're asking is being able to light an entity directly on fire by clicking on it. For me it's mostly because it is near impossible to do it on the ground when there is grass everywhere. That or change how grass is set on fire, for exemple, from whatever side you light grass on fire, left, right, top,.. it could be set to always burn on top or even when using flint and steel on grass, replace it by fire, something like that, there are many options that could be tested. Any other way would be better to how it is now, lighting grass from the side will start a fire on the block next to the gass :(<br>mubash, try it how it is now and you'll understand :/</p>",

Though if you even touch the reactor, they become hostile (being that if the reactor breaks, the piglins zombify) and ambush you with the raid you mentioned a random time. Another thing you could do is.... blow them up, which causes a huge explosion from the reactor itself (like 20 tnt), turning the remaining blocks into assorted nether blocks and making trees warped/crimson. Also, the reactor explosion has a higher debris rate than the nether, being that it just made a huge, hot explosion, and would explain how debris came to be.</p>",

But as great this idea is there are two issues that have to be concidered, 1 damage has to be scaled to allow for at least 20 damage to be taken at terminal velocity so falling deaths can stay consistant some way and two many systems have to be fixed for such a change to be possible becauce systems to detect fall damage would have to be accounted for and differentiation in impact forces have to be considered for horizontal and verticle directs. If horizontal directions were to be used for more realist impact physics, something like running into a wall with high speed will deal damage which would make for a funny death but might not be most favorable to desired minecraft game play.</p>",
