How do you go form \"mesa de trabajo\" (workstation) to \"artboard\"? Even if you translated from word to word, you would get \"table of work\" which sounds weird but at least it would be correct.</p>\n<p>Every single on translation comments that I've seen makes so many errors, that it makes me think y'all just copy past the comment into google translate and paste the result, even if the result is unintelligible- like that time \"pressure plate\" was translated to... \"footstool\"? I get that y'all probably don't have paid human translators, but why post translations that are blatantly wrong over and over?</p>\n<p>If someone has the resources to access this website we're on, then they also have the resources to access whatever translation program y'all are using to copy paste these comments, and if the issue is visibility then do what twitter does and embed Google translate into the site to detect language and translate it. At least then people would understand that the translationj was bot-made and would be aware that errors may be present. The way it is done now people assume the translation was human-made and assume the errors are what the original message actually says.&nbsp;</p>",
