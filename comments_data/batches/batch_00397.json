This way every item will always give one nugget and will give up to 64 nuggets for a full durability chest plate. This is totally linear and pretty balanced, so if the yield feels too high you could reduce that factor from 8 to, say, 5.<br><br>EDIT:<br>I would also add that I think increasing the yield on this is game-balancing. As it is, I would rather throw away extra gear than spend the time, inventory space, and smelting materials to convert it into nuggets. I don't think it is actually worth doing. An entire shulker box of gear yields 3 ingots.</p>",
