I don’t think mining the indication stone should give anything other than normal stone but it would be nice for areas with high chance of ores to have a different looking stone texture near and around it. As for my proposal on chests I have made many worlds where all I did was run around and within around half an hour or an hour depending on the world I had the items to mine obsidian and go to the nether I think it is just too easy to obtain all of the items you need with chests. I don’t think magic items must be added to fix this I just think less ores and more types of chest only items would be nice to make the people who never mine (And I know at least 10 friends of mine who don’t mine in survival) actually mine.</p>",

        "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, so first and foremost I would like to both agree with everyone here, and disagree. Here is my take on the situation. Short and simple, mining is just not necessary. At all. Unless you are one of those crazy people who does mega-builds in survival (like me xD), there is just no need.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As of right now, in less than a couple hours (depending on spawn), you can have a full set of diamond gear, armor and nether portal with some enchantments simply by looting chests from villages, wrecks, and any other loot you find. From a “play only for the story” perspective, this feels too easy. This can be taken advantage of to remove what would normally be extensive hours of cave diving or mining. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From a logical standpoint, it is more practical for even survival players to hunt for chest loot than it is to mine. Take a bed with you and mobs are almost never a problem. And even under water, taking a stack or two of dirt and you can loot everything down there with a low risk of fighting drowned. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Move on to Hardcore, and the game just isn’t hardcore. If the goal is to survival as long as you can, then it is just practical to take the loot approach just because it saves time and is less life risky. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All in all, the game is at the core, too easy to win and play. I admire that minecraft is simple. Sure from time to time I would like more complex challenges and gameplay (but that is what mods are for) but this is just TOO simple. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sure, you can argue “It is a matter of choice and should not be a big deal”. Sure, for some this will be true and they will agree with it, but then where is the fun if a game offers you a cheap alternative to having to work to achieve a goal? Sure, searching for the loot is work. But how much work is it really when you can dodge nights and avoid mobs underwater by building? I think the point by now is clear. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But then how could this be fixed? My solutions:</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ruby’s, Sapphires, ect. Make them rare, but worth a lot of emeralds. Make them tradeable to villagers or be item costs for rare enchantments. Ect. Add more underground dungeons with unique mobs that have unique drops for unique potions or maybe even uncraftable legendary armor/weapons. Just making mining or caving its own adventure without having a cheap alternative to get out of it, Right now outside of mineshafts, there just is not much under the ground to really drag my interest in exploring. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Might be a bit of a far fetched idea, but honesty, why not add underground ruins. Abandoned temples or villages from a long forgotten civilization with rare and unique loot that is otherwise impossible to get elsewhere? Make them rare like the Mansion. Get creative and give us a reason to care about going underground. Beyond what we already have. Do that, and the game just becomes that more interesting. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I digress. </span></p>",
