I can craft anvils with iron blocks, but we still have the choice to uncraft iron blocks. When I’m mining clay, I make blocks using my inventory crafting grid out of the clay balls so my inventory doesn’t fill up too quickly. That’s the whole purpose, just like our coal. All our ores we can craft into blocks and then reverse craft once home. And clay is as common as coal so there’s no rarity like netherwart. We can’t reverse craft netherwart blocks, and so we have to be careful when we choose to make blocks. But clay? Come on. We do so much with the balls and we need the same convenience of carry that we need with our ores. Besides, allowing us to uncraft the clay blocks prevents farming XP by placing the clay over and over. </p>",

I think it would work somewhat similar to how tropical fishes are spawned, because there are limited possibilities/color combinations. Succulents also bloom with beautiful flowers! this could be the bees' alternative when they can't find any other flowers available in the desert. Their appearances could also be seasonal, sometimes in full bloom, or just flowerless. I forgot to mention, that they also come in different sizes, like an agave type could normally be just 3x3 blocks wide, and 1 block tall, but when in full bloom, the whole thing would be like 8 blocks tall! the other succulent varieties would just occupy a whole block, and the smaller types, even smaller than usual (like the flower blocks). They could also be in clumps/clusters in 1 block, just like the turtle eggs.</p>\n<p>I know this is too long, but everything just looks good the way I imagine it!</p>",
