The decision to make copper oxidise naturally also goes against Jeb’s game design book where he states that ‘bad things happen, but they’re technically the players fault’. I’d consider copper oxidising a ‘bad thing’ and its not the player who causes the copper to oxidise, it’s a game mechanic, thus violating this ‘rule for minecraft’. Copper oxidising should be the players decision not the games decision, and i believe copper should exist in a form that can get oxidised and a form that cannot.&nbsp;</p>",
