        "body": "<p>Tin should definitely be added, though I do have a few changes that I would propose to what you have suggested. First of all, I like the idea of in generating under/in mountain biomes and ocean biomes, (I myself had suggested mountains on the post you linked to) with mountains fitting with both the cliffs aspect of this update as well as the gray theme just fitting with them, and with oceans being a challenging but more common place to get tin.. In regard to rivers, that may be an option, but I am not as sure on that one and it might not. One small thing I would argue though is that tin not be&nbsp;<strong>exclusive</strong> to those biomes. It should instead generate only&nbsp;<strong>very</strong> rarely outside of them, at a rarity similar to netherite maybe. In those biomes where it more commonly generates, it should provide a true source of the material, enough so that bronze can be used in the amount that will be necessary. Additionally, as this would make it less rare, piglins would not need to barter it. Besides, gold has already finally achieved its own niche there. Adding tin will provide new benefits to exploration, create greater need for transportation, provide interesting new mining strategy, add new and interesting items, help flush out the archaeology system's benefits, and finally, will make the greatest progression change in the history of Minecraft, providing greater layers of complexity and more.</p>\n<p>I am running out of characters, so I will finish in a second post centered around uses of tin.</p>",

First of all, while I would not be adverse to the proposed ratio, I currently feel that a 1:1 ratio of copper to iron may be advisable, as that would require an equal amount of resources on both parts, forcing player to . Then again, I believe that the historic ratio would be in favor of 2 copper to 1 tin (around 77% copper and 33% tin, though it may have been higher in copper's favor). Next, tin block and cut tin are also necessary and would look great, (I am also in favor of gold or cut gold stairs/slabs, as they would be very helpful in certain builds, though this thread isn't about that) and I would love to see a tin grating bar block, as I have tried to produce that on several occasions, and could not produce a pleasing effect despite the numerous materials I worked with, including trap doors. Pipes would be great, and I have seen them mentioned in several other places, described as having one slot (useful) and being able to also transport items vertically. This will be much easier than annoying rail mechanism and water columns, and will fix the issue of high material expense in survival for redstone contraption. I will note that I have seen suggestions for crafting them of copper or bronze too, so material is up for debate. More uses for nuggets are also necessary, and the keys would take advantage of the preexisting lock nbt.</p>",
