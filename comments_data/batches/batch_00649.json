Besides traps or roads it is the the most useless block in the game. It would mess up cobble generators (for those who just want cobblestone) and it fill up your chests so quickly. Furthermore, unlike cobblestone, you can't make houses or anything out of it, because it is affected by gravity. And it doesn't look good either. The only time I have ever used gravel was once for a villager trapdoor, to protect my cartographers. Sorry if this comes off as mean, but why do you want gravel?</p>",
