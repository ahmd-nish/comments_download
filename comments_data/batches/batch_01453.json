The sun was shining through the leaves and there were a couple deer wandering around. Was awesome. 10/10 would be an amazing idea. Just think,whens the last time you saw a cow,chicken,or sheep wandering the forest? Cause i haven't.but i have seen deer. It would add a new food supply thats tricky to catch and add a real feel to the woods by making them more lively and you could startle the deer by running near them. And the antlers would be dope.we could put them in an item frame on the wall above our fireplaces.</p>",

For example, the Elder Guardian could perhaps has a new move where it could shoot out its spikes and they sort of home towards you as well has having a new tail whip attack when you get too close. When they die, instead of dropping sponges, since you can already find them in rooms somewhere, and instead drop either a gold block or a new prismarine block that you can only find from elder guardians. Can even add bosses for the progress for the end, for example, add a new nether fortress boss so that end eyes can be crafted from what this boss drops instead of crafting the m from blaze powder from regular blazes. Makes the progress towards the end more challenging and more rewarding.</p>",

It has health points surrounding it in a circle that the player must destroy before the Boss transforms to its next phase. In which, now the player must move quick enough to not get caught in periodic poison spikes that arise while trying to take out the health points again. The final phase will be Phase one and Two combined. This boss will be located in the Nether in the Crimson or the Warped forest biome. This “Piranha Plant” will have a naturally generated “arena” that makes it difficult to get out once the fight starts(maybe like a 2-3 block drop into its enclosure so that if it is attacking you, you dont have much time to break the blocks to get out).</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boss 2 - Withering Away</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">There should be a Parity Update for Java in which the wither gains all of the move sets that the bedrock version has. This includes the charge attack, the random blow up that happens, and spawning wither skeletons when down to a certain HP. </span></p>",

When the civilization had died and all that was left was the golem, he retreated to the mines to which the redstone and iron make up had started to fuse together due to moisture and neglect. A large brute force melee attacking type of monster. Similar to Minecraft dungeons. He starts as a normal hand to hand type fight, but the next phase becomes more difficult as he can smash the ground and make a splash damage effect. The final phase becomes a bit more explosive as he has the ability to leave behind/throw/ignite TNT. This boss will naturally spawn in mines in a new room similar to that big open dirt room in mineshafts already.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">Boss 4 - Test Through Darkness </span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">A warden is a being that guards something. I think that something should be the mysterious portal looking thing. But instead of a portal it is a gateway that releases the Necromancer. The Necromancer re-animates dead mobs that have died and formed into the skulk to come back and fight the player on his behalf while the boss fight goes on. The Necromancer should be similar to the Minecraft Dungeons game where he is a ranged attack using a soul bow or something that gets shot at the player(Relies more on the mobs he spawns than the projectiles he throws). He is a flying/floating type (stays remotely close to the ground similar to the wither).&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>",

I want to do something different with the Skulk eye though, You would eat it to gain night vision, but it wouldn't make you invisible in low light, as that is too OP with the high drop rate of the eyes. And as for being able to see the skulks in low light, that should just be an effect after eating the eye, or night vision would allow you to see them normally. I felt like the whole soul fire attraction would give people who have been to the Nether a way to avoid unwanted encounters with this mob, and because I thought it would be a funny quirk. The oldest comment asked why it was gray, and I don't think I did a good job at explaining the appearance, Think something like the bone devil in D&amp;D 5e mixed with a velociraptor. I also didn't mention this, but if you want to rack my brain even more than I did making The Skulker, I will make a new mob suggestion if you can reach a vote goal of 25.</p>",

They could be a very cute addition to the game and create burrow blocks, dirt blocks with holes through them that join up.

Drowned do not want to be poisoned, and will flee from them. Will swallow gravel, sand, coarse dirt, and clay, but only five blocks for two minutes. If you kill one, it will drop these blocks. They will swallow more blocks if you equip a chest on a tamed one, and you will be able to take out the blocks from the chest. They can store 4 stacks. If you manually give (\"feed\") them sediment, you may tame them. Tamed platypuses will follow you, sit, or be assigned to a job, though they will automatically follow you. Sitting is the second option. To assign one to a specific block type, you put the block in their inventory by itself. If you put in multiple, they will swallow all of the types specified. If you do not put any in, they will eat one block, and assign themselves to that block. To reassign, you may remove as many blocks as needed and add a stone block or stone variant (blackstone, end stone, netherrack, etc all work). This will clog their chest intake, and they will stop collecting. If you remove every other block and add in a new piece of sediment, they will reset to it. If you remove the stone block, they will then continue with the new job. If you remove all blocks and remove the stone immediately, they will go back to collecting all blocks. They are faster, and faster at mining, in water. They can be affected by haste.</p>",

And in the desert biome have and elf owl, it would be cool if they nested in cacti like they do in their natural habitat so have a different cactus texture that looked like a hole in the cactus and when it turned to night the owl would fly out.They make a hooting noise when not flying and a very, very quiet&nbsp;<em>churr, churr, churr&nbsp;&nbsp;</em>noise when flying. The big ones would be would be 1.5 blocks high and one block wide either way and the small one (Elf owl in desert) would be one block high and one block wide either way. They would attack rabbits on sight and you will be able to tame them with rabbit meat&nbsp; and if you do they can bring you rabbit meat if they are in the right biome, sort of like foxes. After you tame them you can make them perch on your shoulder like you do parrots. If you are in the right biome to get rabbits, make the owl perch on your shoulder and then send it out hunting, it will only do so at a specific time of day (in the dawn/dusk hours) and then it will bring you back rabbit meat in about 30 sec-2 mins and then it will land in front of you and drop the rabbit meat. The reason I want them is that I think that they will be a nice addition to the game adding a nice atmosphere being useful by being tamed.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/FbI-EYnGa34omlePagoPJw.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/R-AawUxqM6gB3Gq3nX-Q4A.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/xtC5_uHVj_eM1Ef7qop5Hg.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>So I hope you add owls and this made sense, so goodbye for the present&nbsp;</p>",

They can only generate in oceans within 5 blocks of the surface and up to 2 blocks above sea level.
