        "body": "<p>More reasons why the new \"improved launcher\" is not really an improvement:<br>- Launcher start-up (account verification) is extremely slow and unreliable. It often logs me out for no reason.</p>\n<p>- Creating a desktop shortcut or a custom Minecraft directory is a pain with the new launcher. With the old launcher, you could easily make a desktop shortcut and add a proper \"--workDir\" to its properties, allowing you to move all your Minecraft files to a custom directory. The new, \"improved\" launcher enforces the custom directory for many files.</p>\n<p>- The \"new and improved\" launcher is in many ways identical compared to the old one. Some real, more than a decade old issues, like the lack of an option to launch the game in maximized window mode by default, still haven't been adressed to this day (and no, I'm not talking about full screen mode, I'm talking about a simple, maximized window instead of the default tiny window it launches the game with!)</p>\n<p>- The only benefit of using the new launcher would be to have access to both MC Java and Bedrock Edition. I thought old players would have access to both versions, but after a lot of poking around, I found out support for this ended in April 2020. Now we get capes instead. No, that's not an improvement at all!</p>",

Also, the majority of apps are total junk (1 to 2.5 stars with hundred thousands downloads is very common), or have better alternatives outside the store (often free), or they are remakes of original software and do not work the same as the originals.</p>\n<p>I call it the Microsoft Junkyard. If I had made such a thing (I am a coder of 20 years) I would so fast clean up the crap, fix the interface, and beg the community for forgiveness.</p>\n<p>It seems of late (very late) that store improvements are happening. I haven't personally confirmed. I have about zero interest in the very idea of a take-over MS store, whether it gets any better or not.)</p>\n<p>Forcing Minecraft into it makes the store look better. Unfortunately Minecraft now resides in world of refuse. Who would have ever thought? Reading around various places, nobody did, nor do they much like it.</p>\n<p>But this is not new of major companies. We honestly have to look at the bright side. MC still exists, it's still a good game. And somehow, despite similar profoundly ridiculous achievements among big companies, it's not all so bad. If they do stupid stuff and everybody says it's stupid, it's only their loss. I have to remind myself: Don't let companies or people take your joy along with whatever else they took, lesser things, like time and convenience. Hold onto your peace. They don't deserve that.</p>",

In my humble opinion, nothing was more iconic than the grass block, which practically screams MINECRAFT!&nbsp; While the developers may have gotten tired of seeing the same icon, some of us users are quite attached to it.&nbsp; We should have that choice to keep our historic icon, or accept the new default one, by including other [past] icons in the .exe file for us to choose from in the launcher's properties.&nbsp; If not included in the launcher .exe file, please have the updater download an .ico file into the launcher directory for us to choose other icons from.</p>",
