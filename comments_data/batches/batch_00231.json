It could be that adding bone meal to concrete powder makes plaster, but the concrete recipe is already complex and non-renewable to craft so making plaster a tertiary crafting recipe seems messy. Or the plaster recipe could be bone meal + dye + bottles of water, but water bottles are non-stackable and then it would have to leave the water bottles in the crafting table. Or perhaps it could incorporate clay.</p>\n<p>Either way, I think using bone meal in the recipe is most intuitive for players because you're using a whitish substance to get a light-coloured blockset, and because bones are made of plaster and plaster's components are calcium-based powders.</p>",

Rather than make the same post, I think I'll just comment here.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I agree with what another comment mentioned about the recipe producing 6 trapdoors instead of just two. Mathematically, it makes a lot of sense.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The recipe for trapdoors is essentially the same as regular doors, just rotated. Since a trapdoor is half the size of a regular door, it should produce 6 trapdoors, which would equal the 3 regular doors we get from the door recipe. This would make it balanced and leave the door recipe the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the end, the door recipe is very balanced. A door is two blocks tall, so every two blocks of the recipe makes one door, resulting in 3 doors from the recipe. It should be the same for trapdoors.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To the developers who work so hard on the game, I hope you consider this idea! I'm a builder and tend to go through a lot of wood on these details. It would mean so much if the trapdoor recipe could be more balanced with the door recipe.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To the original poster, thank you for posting this! I hope the issue gets more attention. And sorry for my long rambly comment on your post, I'm just very passionate about these doors!</p>",

        "body": "<p>I love this idea! Apparently, you and me are thinking alike, because a while later, I had the same idea. I didn't realize you thought of it first, but here is a quote from my suggestion \"Sometimes when starting a new Minecraft world, nether fortresses are very difficult to find and other times they are relatively easy to find. It's almost like there's a 50% chance you'll find one only after a ton of digging, and a 50% chance it will pretty much be there. I feel that it is important to at least give players a way \"out\" so to speak by crafting some kind of locator. It could be expensive to craft, but the materials should still be accessible, probably from materials in the nether such as quartz, gold, and maybe some other more expensive materials. I think a simple way to do this would be to have a nether compass which points to the nearest nether fortress. To ensure that people can't craft one and use it forever, I think the compass should remember the coordinates of the nearest fortress as soon as it's first held. After that, it will stop searching for new nether fortresses and you will only be able to use that compass to find that fortress. Thanks for considering this idea! :)\" I think this would be very cool and should definitely be added to the nether update!</p>",
