It could generate in either the lush caves or a mushroom cave biome. Also, marble could be made from smelted limestone (like in real life) and maybe limestone would be more of a green tinged tan rather then gray. Finally, have you considered slate or shale? They are two common stone blocks in real life that are not yet in Minecraft.</p>",
