I think the thing that makes the Phantom hated is that it is too difficult to avoid. Sure, you can sleep or go inside, but if there is some reason as to why you must be outside at night, like traveling a long distance, then this mob becomes too great a nuisance. With other hostile mobs, there is always some way to avoid combat, usually by running, but with the Phantom, that is not possible, and its long attack patterns leave a lot of time between being able to hit it. Just having it attack livestock naturally and then engage with the player if provoked would keep the feel of the mob and its combat challenge while making it an avoidable occurrence (without the need of constantly sleeping).</p>",
