Perhaps even some especially rare books, such as the ender dragon book, and the wither book. Another especially rare book may be a story about Notch. One last thing what if there was a Herobrine horror story but the chance of him trading that was like 0.1 %. But if you get it and read through you may have a few interesting encounters for the next few minecraft days until they eventually stop for no reason. I don't necessarily mean obvious encounters, but subtle ones. Although subtle enough to completely go unnoticed.</p>",

It's not exactly stealing.<br><br>2.) As others have said, what happens if we are building a new village or rebuilding an old one? Either villagers would act like every chest is theirs (which is bad) or the game would have to store the coordinate of the spawned chest and give it a unique ID so that villagers know that any chest at that location is theirs, but then after tearing down the village and building a new one in it's place they'd have that behavior if you happen to drop a chest at that coordinate at some point in the future OR you'd never be able to let a village see you open any chest anywhere ever again. Depending on which way it's implemented, of course. Either way it's bad.<br><br>3.) If opening that chest resulted in an iron golem being called it would be royally abused. All you'd need to do is attach a few hoppers to it, have a death trap surrounding it, and every time you open it a golem will spawn then die then give you iron. Not that automatic golem farms don't already exist, but that would make it possible to do with significantly less resources.</p>",
