Similarly, tinted glass could lower the light level by two each, up to 7 crafted around the lamp. If it becomes eight, the lamp only glows on itself, and doesn't light anything up. This could be cool if you could put tinted glass over any other stained glass ones, as well, to get darker colored lights! I know it's complicated, and it creates a ton of outcomes, but there are thousands of tropical fish, so I'm sure Mojang could do it. Thank you for reading my comment! :)</p>",

They also give a different color depending on the signal strength. This can be useful for computational redstoners to make a colored display.</p>",

Redstone Wire - Recipe here could be similar or a bit more complex, maybe adding a new ore like copper (copper + redstone + slime balls = redstone wire). Same functionality described above, but the looks would be more like an actual wire with a 2x2 3d model perhaps to provide some shape. Still would have to be placed on a block to work.</p>\n<p>3. Redstone Pipe - This is probably the most advanced implementation of this idea. It would essentially function as its own block but look like a pipe. This way you could route redstone signals in any direction (e.g. up and down now) in a single vertical 1x1 column without using other blocks as support. The use of copper or another sturdy material here would also make a lot of sense.</p>",

Esta redstone especial sería como la normal solo que se podría colocar en suelo pared y techo.</p>\n<p>También me parece una buena idea que para conectar esta redstone con el mar normal necesario una especie de transformador o conector, que podría ser un repetidor o comparador de redstone.</p>\n<p>Otra cosa que me gustaría añadir es que esta redston actuaría como los marcos, puedes poner varias <em>sticky</em><em>redstone </em>en un único bloque siempre y cuando estén en posiciones distintas, me explico en un hueco de 1x1x1 se podría colocar <em>stickyredstone</em> en todas las paredes, techo y suelo al mismo tiempo.</p>\n<p>Espero que os guste mi idea, ya que tengo muchas más en otras publicaciónes.</p>\n<p>Si queréis contactar conmigo podéis hacerlo en los sigientes correos:</p>\n<p><em>[removed, never put your email in a post ~ admin]</em></p>",

Maybe even having it where it also has to crafted with vines to go up walls. ( there are different types of rails in game why not power lines?)Its a long shot depending on how it affects the game as a whole and weather or not it causes bugs in game or not. But we can leave that up to the developers.</p>",

Copper wires would be an item made from a combination of redstone and copper ingots. They would have the ability to stack up vertically as well as go horizontally. They will not directly connect to redstone allowing for them to be placed side by side with redstone without either effecting the other(similar to the slimeblock and honey block mechanics). If you do want to connect them you would use a new item known as a copper outlet. What this would do is allow you to convert a redstone signal into a copper signal and vice versa. Basically you would place redstone dust on one side, and copper wire on the other. Upon a signal traveling through one the copper outlet would also send it through the other. </p>",

It doesnt require making any new blocks it just changes the property of the block to Redwaxed_Block when you read the description and it only powers other adjacent redwaxed blocks or adjacent Redstone accessories (pistons, repeaters, Redstone Dust, lamps etc). So basically you would use any block that can be waxed and Redstone powered and build whatever. It's perfect! All directions of travel: check. Selective powering: check. Hidden/aesthetically pleasing: check. I was thinking the repeator could be mixed with wax too to create a Repeater Redwax and when applied to a block that block will act like a repeater. It can be set by right clicking and it will have Redstone ore particles on for an amount of seconds equivalent to the level. I also submitted an idea to use the amethyst and a Redstone torch to make a Redstone Laser that can power the first opaque block it hits. It can travel through transparent blocks, has range of 16 or 32 blocks but will be interrupted by players,  mobs, or other opaque blocks.  I'm awaiting approval on those suggestions to be posted but I think it's plausible...</p>",

On bedrock, I had developed a real auto playing \"jukebox\" with skip function, playlists, and \"now playing\" indicator lamps. It was awesome. WAS. it's now a super fancy version of what you have in one jukebox block. What a waste. My suggestion? Give the jukebox a proper interface (like a furnace). Up to 3 discs may be input, after playing, disc moves to output slot and ejects itself. If a hopper or a hopper minecart is under the jukebox, the output slot is immediately emptied. You know, like a furnace. Basically reuse the furnace code. Instead of fire animation on a furnace, it's playing music. you know, if it had to \"burn fuel\" to play a song, you know, like a furnace, it becomes a \"flex\" and something advanced players will appreciate. A furnace produces a redstone signal but does not block it's own output. Jukeboxes that cannot play more than one disc without changing the disc physically are NOT jukeboxes. They are single use disc players. Fix this please. It's been years without the love these discs deserve.</p>",

Well, despite being an option that would generate less effort for processors, as they are less blocks than the game would need to energize, this behavior is related to the idea of ​​being able to run a wire through the water, which should be an isolated wire, because I hope that no one receives shock damage when entering the water.</p>\n<p>3) <strong>a great conductor</strong>: as the wire is today, they are excellent conductors, so I would find it strange that they decrease their strength as they advance through the wire.

However they cannot directly transfer signals to each other allowing for them to be side by side in contraptions without interacting with eachother.(similar to slime and honey) Instead if you wish for a copper wire to transfer a signal to redstone dust and vice versa you would need a new redstone device to do so. A copper outlet. This device would allow you to send a signal from a copper wire through one end and allow a redstone signal out the other and vice versa allowing for a switch between the 2. Additionally copper wires can stack up allowing for upward redstone. One other thing is to also have versions of contraptions that work for redstone that would work for copper such as a copper comparator or a copper repeater. These devices would specifically work for copper additionally they would be constructed to work with the copper wires being able to stack up on eachother and move down areas without being placed on top of other blocks by allowing attatchment from all sides of them. As for the underwater part, and possible differences between how they conduct or how far they conduct I will leave alone. That is all.</p>",

I am posting this here in the comment section so it can find a relevant audience without being removed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">Sorting systems require way too many resources. Current methods for doing this are too fragile. Manipulating the push / pull effect with redstone is frustrating. Give us a hopper to filter input.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">It's recipe should be a Comparator on top of a Hopper.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">The GUI is two slots:</p>\n<ol class=\"s90z9tc-13 elNkWH\">\n<li class=\"s90z9tc-11 irlrft\">\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">For the item it can accept.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s90z9tc-11 irlrft\">\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">For items input from the top or from other hoppers.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">Put a diamond in the first slot and the second slot fills up with diamonds input from connected hoppers and containers above. Items are output from the second slot to an attached container.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">Powering the hopper with redstone will output the item from the filter slot to an attached container, thus making the filter empty. An empty filter slot means the other slot does not accept items. An item input from the side while the filter slot is empty and not powered will go into the filter slot instead of the output slot, thus changing the filter can be automatic. If there is a filter, items input from the side will go into the output slot as normal.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">Everything else works exactly like current hoppers.</p>\n<p class=\"s90z9tc-10 fHRkcP\">This tool will&nbsp;<strong class=\"s90z9tc-14 juBaow\">vastly</strong>&nbsp;simplify sorting systems. If I only want diamonds from a chest, I put one of these under a chest, with one diamond in the filter and no redstone is necessary. I could do some other fancy things with redstone that are currently impossible to do. The Filter Hopper would do for item transport what the Repeater did for redstone.</p>",

It would also make it easier to integrate multiple systems without requiring an engineering degree to understand and maintain them.</p>\n<p>I believe we're moving in the right direction with the recently added redstone changes and blocks.

This I have thought of a while back, and I definitely want it as it fixes probably 90% of the issues with piston randomness while leaving in the one good bit about it, easy randomizers. There is a situation where the randomness is still a problem, namely if a piston is going to extend, and it is also going to be pushed or pulled in the same tick. The piston extending first is the more useful option I think. This can speed up the max speed of Redstone contraptions, as currently you need to make sure that piston starting movement and finishing movement stages are separated to prevent unpredictable behavior, this change will allow you to often combine those stages, allowing for the max speed to increase by up to a factor of two, although there are situations where this change doesn't make things faster, due to pistons that have just been pushed into a space where they are powered only extending the next tick. This can be fixed by updating the finishing of movement before power sources and circuits update, while updating the starting of movement after circuits update, likely in the updating components phase. I have now hit the 1500 limit.</p>",

        "body": "<p>There is something I can note as an improvement to the suggestion. Currently, a good rule of thumb is to have 2 redstone kick delays between piston activations or deactivations. The rule works in nearly all situations as the maximum speed possible without randomness, but with this change, 1 Redstone tick delays would become the new standard in most situations, but not all.</p>\n<p>For piston extenders, 1 tick delays would be used for retraction, but 2 tick delays for extension, due to pistons in Bedrock Edition waiting a tick after their power changed before starting movement. I would suggest removing the delay only in situations where the piston was just moved and finished moving this tick.</p>\n<p>I would suggest that the way to do this would be to update pistons and moving blocks finishing movement before all other redstone updates, then for all pistons just moved, if there is a redstone signal powering them (This will be the same as the previous redstone tick as other redstone components haven't been updated yet) they will be powered with a 1 redstone tick delay pending tick. The game will then drop it by 1 to 0 along with other pending ticks as it thinks the pending tick was from the previous redstone tick, and the piston will extend in the component update step.</p>\n<p>This will make the delay for an extender extending consistent with the delay for retracting, as well as making extension twice as fast and making the new 1 redstone tick rule of thumb more consistent for pistons.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I don't think you could implement this as a block state like waterlogging very easily. In Bedrock at least, waterlogging required a profound revision to the way blocks are represented in the game and in save files. It was worth all that work for waterlogging because it changed the entire game, but all that work for just one block type seems very expensive. So it would most likely have to be implemented as a new block that *looks and acts* like a slab and redstone dust but isn't either one, and you'd have to convert slabs and dust to and from it when placing and breaking them. There problem here is that it isn't seamless: How would you indicate whether you were trying to break the slab part or the dust part? There's no other block that needs such a distinction, and you can't get around the problem by saying \"break them both\" because the result would be unintuitive: they *look and act* like two separate blocks in every other way.</p>\n<p>Are you thinking about this only for a top slab, where the bottom half would have one of seven redstone dust configurations (including the dot)? Or are you also thinking of redstone dust (in the same seven configurations) on top of a bottom slab, which would enable redstone wires in vertically adjacent block positions? That would nicely solve a lot of problems with wire crossovers that make a device ridiculously tall.</p>\n<p>Implementing the top slab version seems more complicated, because the game would have to check for a block that can support redstone dust underneath it when you add the dust under the slab. In addition, anything that moves or breaks the block underneath would have to convert the block into the equivalent dustless slab and drop a dust. I think that would be the only case of a block that isn't (visually) broken dropping an item, so it's uncharted waters, which might mean there would be some surprises trying to make it work.</p>\n<p>Both top and bottom slab versions would also have to have all the behavior of redstone dust, with its varying brightness levels and particle effects.</p>\n<p>I like this idea and would be pleased if it were implemented. I just think it would take an enormous amount of work.</p>",

It also should need a Redstone signal to output one, be slow doing its side-tasks, (like melting, freezing, or killing). Also, I feel that instead of the one being able to change between hot/cold/power, it should only be able to change between hot/power or cold/power depending on how you crafted it. The crafting recipes should be fairly expensive, and for my heater/cooler idea, the recipe could require blaze rods/powder for a \"heater\" and ice for a \"cooler\". There also could be a generic \"sender\" which cannot heat or cool, only transmit power. This could use something like Redstone blocks instead of the blaze/ice. Also, the idea of extinguishing torches... Isn't a favorite among the Minecraft community. It was going to be added early on, with lanterns as a never-dying equivalent, but never happened, and doubt it would happen for this idea. Maybe instead of that function, it will turn rain, within its range, into snow.</p>",

Most of the comments to the contrary usually say how OP it is, but we already have ways of farming wood and that's just one step away from fueling our furnaces, if you don't shove it right in as a log in the first place.</p>\n<p>Lava drips are slow, taking about a minecraft day to actually fill a cauldron. You'd need a massive farm to get to overpowered levels. Not to mention what you need to get in order to get a farm like that going.</p>\n<p>1: Observers- These blocks require nether quartz, which means the player already has access to a near infinite source of lava within fairly easy reach. Not to mention the player already has access to diamond to a decent degree if they're willing to enter the nether for a project like this.</p>\n<p>2: Dispensers- People don't think about it too often, but dispensers need bows to be crafted. String isn't an easy thing to come across, as anybody who has tried to make large farms know. So the closer you get to 'OP', the more bows you'll need to compensate for that</p>\n<p>3: Cauldrons- These are freaking expensive, you're making dozens of iron pants for one farm not to mention the pistons that require iron as well.</p>\n<p>All in all, I think letting players automatically remove something from cauldrons not only makes sense, but wouldn't be that different from what we currently have.</p>",

This lesson of the game is particularly valuable; look to outside sources for help. Looking to outside sources is a life skill that goes beyond Minecraft and YouTube. But Minecraft and YouTube are a start at this level.</p>\n<p>I hope we never get a Redstone guide book. I hope they never treat us a babies, and spoon feed us.

As it stands, Minecraft Redstone makes us, the community, work together, as we would in the real world, to make a better world.</p>\n<p>In the real world, the big new answer isn't in an office or laboratory. Usually we have to go to a library or a conference or look things up online to find new information or ideas. The revelations from this effort inspire us to think of things in ways we hadn't thought of before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The day will come when a players skill and discoveries in Redstone exceeds their education. When that ability comes through earned knowledge and effort it will be far more rewarding than if it had just been given to them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The makers of Minecraft are doing that right now with this website, asking for feedback so they can have good, purpose driven ideas to make a better game.

Nobody is suggesting putting things in the game that provides all the answers, or removes the ability to be inspired by or build on other's work. Nothing in this suggestion prevents, or removes the need to have tutorials and other sources of information provided by players. The suggestion is simply to have <strong>basic</strong> information in game. Libraries you mention are not useful, if people are not taught to read first. Sure you can replicate the pictures from the books without understanding, they may even work. That doesn't allow people to build on top of or improve them.</p>\n<p>If still unclear, the basic information we're talking about would not include builds. It includes information like what does what is redstone power, what does redstone dust do, what does it power, what does a repeater do, what does a comparator do, what does a piston do, etc. Some of this is already in game, but the elementary basics are missing.</p>\n<p>This isn't any different than what schools provide (especially college/technical schools). They don't solve the problems you'll encounter in your life. They equip you with the knowledge so that you can solve your problems yourself.

Introducing logic blocks won't stop anyone from building logic gates the old fashioned way if they enjoy mindless, repetitive activities. And if you like \"complexity\" then you can just use the new logic blocks to build stuff that's even more complex than anything you built before.</p>\n\n<p>As an educational tool, forcing players to re-implement logic gates over and over and over again is pointless. In the real world, once you solve a computational problem, you encapsulate that logical problem in a module so you never have to deal with it again if you don't want to. You don't keep reinventing the wheel. Players would learn more by seeing how logic can be abstracted.</p>\n\n<p>On top of all of this, redstone behavior in Minecraft  is just plain stupid and always has been. I'm not even sure that most of it was intentional to begin with as opposed to an unintentional byproduct of some sort of bug. You have to memorize nonsensical rules about how the various redstone components power neighboring blocks and how they behave when powered. In part this is because you can't place redstone dust vertically, so you have to invent implict rules for power to magically teleport up and down and through some blocks and not others. This all makes Minecraft logic gates and circuits way more complicated and confusing than actual, real world logic circuits that perform the same tasks.</p>",
