Over 10,000 unique models have already been created, which have diversified and beautified game worlds.</p>\n<p>However, many players are disappointed that these models are only available on the Java platform, while Bedrock remains unsupported. Adding Display-entities to Bedrock will empower the community, allow more players to utilize a variety of models, and improve the overall gaming experience.</p>\n<p>Please consider implementing Display entities on Bedrock. This would be an important step forward for the entire Minecraft ecosystem.</p>",

Imagine having to turn off music every time you get to a server that has custom note block music? Or what if you use music sounds and put them to play on the music source, players with it off won't hear it. Also, I like natural musics, I don't want to accidentaly leave it off after turning it off for hearing a custom music or testing some other thing when I join another server or a new singleplayer world.</p>",
