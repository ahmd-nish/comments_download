Now for the spear, there's actually different types of spears and the ones that minecraft has (which are actually lances and not spears) aren't made with obsidian, flint or anything like that, so it already makes sense how it is now. It should be nerfed tho, like, a reaaally big nerf cuz it's absurd how much damage you can do with it without needing to time or aim at all. The rest of suggestions are great actually, even tho the crafting recipe for the dried ghast makes sense (the ghast tears are used for things related to regeneration and bringing life like the regen potion and the end crystals) it's still kinda weird and it's already renewable because of Piglins. And the discs, yeah, kinda dumb how you obtain them. Would be better as loot as you said.</p>",
