Lava already has a particle that sparks of the lava block. (increasing the number of these particles when the lava is rising could help make it look more like an eruption)</p>\n<p>2. Furnaces have smoke particles.</p>\n<p>3. when it snows snow layers pile up gradually. (Also, if you place a lava block in the air&nbsp;and cut of its source before it fully spreads, if you look closely, a very thin sheet of lava will start to fall to the ground. So in a way we already kind of have thin lava layers)</p>\n<p>So I guess its just a bunch of particles with rising lava. As long as the particles are in a moderate amount it shouldn't cause to much lag for a rare short event.</p>\n<p>Sure, it'd be a little complicated to actually code out, but anything worth having takes work to earn. Complication/a little elbow grease shouldn't be a reason to count out a good idea. Especially if it adds a nostalgic air of realism to the game that could also pose a slight obstacle for the player.</p>",

These volcanoes stretch above the build height limit, and when they erupt, not only could they do extreme amounts of damage to the environment, but they would also change the weather in all biomes, making it snowy for a long duration until it goes to normal. Hot biomes such as the desert and savanna would just start raining whenever there is precipitation.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I think this is a cool idea, but in my opinion i would like it rather to be just a volcanic biome having volcanic activity that doesn't pour lava everywhere making builds close to it burn up. The biome should be a biome that only appears in the middle of the Gravelly mountains or the badlands to make it not look weird. Like it would be weird if you saw a snowy biome with a river seperating it from a desert with a volcanic biome right next to that, with a small touch of plains in the middle. So basically to make it look more natural. When the volcanic biome is made in a badlands or gravelly mountains, it should be called something like Volcanic gravelly mountains and Volcanic Badlands. Also it should be a bit rare. Now, For the volcanic stuff, if there is a mountain in the biome (probably around y = 105), it will or might be turned into a volcano having obsidian or probably basalt around the top and lava inside a hole formed in the top with more smoke effects than usual. For the eruptions, the standard lava \"pops\" or in other words the lava bubble effect can suddenly start to increase in quantity and reaching higher for a small amount of time, and could also have a shaking effect on players around (making what you see shake). This effect could then probably be accesible by commands for map makers. And the eruptions should also be controllable by commands like: \"/gamerule doVolcanicEruption false/true\"&nbsp; &nbsp; and \"/volcanicEvent @e[r=50,type=volcano] enable\" or something like that idk. but for the Surrounding terrain in the volcanic biome, it should have areas with stone and small geyser like things with the magma blocks in it. Villages could probably spawn there but im not sure. Also mobs, special volcanic mobs would be epic, just absolutely EPIC.</p>",

Plus adding basalt to the game would add a type of black rock to the game, as we currently only have obsidian, black terracotta, and concrete.</p>\n<p>Volcanic eruptions can be a particle effect shooting out molten rocks and clouding the sky with dense smoke. The rocks will turn into a volcanic rock type if they happen to land in water and will not cause fires ( or volcanic fire could be an optional setting ). If you go up the volcano and get into the smoke, or are high enough up in a volcano biome you will get a volcanic smoke debuff that will poison you. Smoke would not occur underwater and getting hit with volcanic rock would do a half heart of damage. On land volcanic rock would cause 1 heart of damage.</p>\n<p>If you want lava flows, then any unmined blocks hit with a volcanic rock will turn into lava.

Sulfur could take the form of either an ore close to the surface, or as dirt or stone that has a build up of sulfur (these blocks could have a yellowish hue to them). Mining them gives you sulfur powder, which could be made into sulfur blocks. My idea is that sulfur blocks deter undead mobs from a certain radius around the block, similar to how garlic works in fantasy books and movies. These blocks could be placed around your base to keep the zombies, skeletons, or phantoms away. Another use could be to make gunpowder. In real life, sulfur is used to make it, so why not in Minecraft too? Sulfur powder could be crafted with charcoal or coal to make it. Sulfur could be brewed to make potions that deter undead mobs from you, or give you fire resistance. It could also be used as fuel for furnaces. Since in real life, sulfur gives off sulfur dioxide-a toxic gas, when burned, it could cause you to loose health or give you poisoning around a certain radius of the furnace. To make up for this, sulfur could be one of the best fuels in the game, like a bucket of lava. If sulfur is added to the game, it would only spawn in volcanic biomes (similar to how emeralds only spawn in extreme hills, however it would be about as abundant as iron or coal), which would give you a reason to seek out volcanoes.</p>",

Instead, you'll have to dig down into the springs to look for an overworld type of magma block that you'll have to mine and place down before you place the water source on top of it. Hot springs will have to be managed by the player. The overworld magma blocks may have a timer on how long they are able to stay hot after being removed from their original biome.&nbsp;You'll need to recharge them every so often with fresh lava. This could possibly be done by simply removing the rocks from the springs and pouring lava over them to reheat the blocks.</p>\n<p>While throwing a splash potion into the pool may increase the number of people the water could effect at once, the same times should be applied to the water for the potions in order to make the springs not&nbsp;<em>too</em> powerful.<br><br>Water purity would also be a&nbsp; factor.

        "body": "<p>While I like the idea of a Volcano Biome, I feel as though snow wouldn't make sense seeing how the biome is a hot biome, villagers would likely die off quickly due to how harsh the environment is, and an eruption event would cause needless block updates that could result in hindered performance. However, I do think this idea could be expanded on, first with biome variants. Idle Volcano Biomes could still contain lava, but would not have lava flow out without player input. Perhaps this variant could also reward adventurers with a cave that contains treasures at the risk of lava? Active Volcano Biomes could generate with lava flowing over the sides to simulate an eruption. Lastly, Underwater Volcano Biomes could generate underwater, and have plenty of obsidian. Perhaps each variant could also generate with small surface patches of diamond ore, to reward and encourage adventuring, and to reflect how real life diamonds are formed.</p>",

Another example could be the different types of above water volcanoes and the different areas that they are found, such as a constantly erupting island, or a magnificent, unsuspecting cone that appears to be a mountain, but is prone to erupt at any second. This would be paired with an extremely long cooldown between eruptions (for the more explosive ones. Brought together it could bring a new way of playing and another level of risk for players. Perhaps players could also choose whether or not they wish to have eruptions take place either via /gamerule or by use of an option during world generation. The severity and frequency of eruptions could also be decided by the in-game difficulty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

I think it would be neat if there was a new weapon to go along with ruby. A staff. The staff would be craftable using two blaze rods and one ruby, the staff would do about as much damage as the trident when using it as a melee weapon but I think it would be neat if the staff could fire out orbs of energy like a bow. The staff would lose two durability points every time an orb was fired and lose one durability point every time the player used it as a melee weapon. The staff would be repairable by using rubies in an anvil. This is all just an idea but I really do think it would be a good thing to go along with a volcano biome.</p>",

Also, if they do add something like this, I hope they add a new ore with it. Something along the lines of&nbsp; lavastone (I feel like thats already a real thing though) or magmastone. I'd want it to have an amber look. Or they could add a real ore called bauxite (they'd probably call it nether bauxite because they call quartz nether quartz). Maybe they could also use this as a way to implement the red dragon.</p>",

However, I think that the biome shouldn’t just be a single volcano, but many: some active ones with flows of lava, others dormant ones with obsidian and the new basalt blocks where the lava used to be. The biome should also contain hot springs (lakes with magma blocks beneath) and chasms containing lava and magma. The volcanoes should be large but not unreasonably sized - slightly taller than the extreme hills. Inside, they should contain a feed pipe - which runs from the bottom of the crater to the lava lakes near the bedrock layer. It would be composed of a tube of obsidian, basalt and other volcano-themed blocks and should have lava and magma at the core of it is in an active volcano, but not if it is part of a dormant one. I like the idea of villages on the sides of the volcano, but there should also be some abandoned villages near lava flows that have been buried under ash and lava from past eruptions, like Pompeii.</p>",

Also, tiny hills of ash should be generated along with patches of a new block called gabbro. It would be a decoration block but can be crafted into stone and polished gabbro, polished gabbro slabs, stairs, etc.&nbsp; Now about the mobs, there should be a new mob just or the biome, and it should be the Ash Guardians. This mob would be territorial and would not like visitors. They are a zombie-like creature that gives the player slowness 1 if he gets attacked. Ash Guardians would drop ash dust which can be placed in composters and if termites get added this Ash dust could prevent ant from getting near. 1 more thing, the biome should be called Volcano Valleys.</p>",

Imagine having to climb down the volcano to find rare ores in a giant magma pit exposed by the sun atop, which would be very unique and beautiful. It could also fit other play styles like if you're careful you could mine through the side of the volcano and avoid magma pools while digging to get to the rare ores. Sure some of this is unrealistic but that's what makes it unique, plus it's a perfect example of risk for reward, and spices up your Minecraft adventure, especially when building a base in it or around it. Instead of erupting since in actuality it takes a heck ton of time before one erupts, it would just generate with lava flowing down the sides and create those big booming sounds rarely. You could think of it as a rare type of ambience in that biome specifically. The volcano would be very very deep with lava to build around and dodge and ledges to build to. To give justice to that thought, water would evaporate somewhat deep within the volcano so you can't entirely or at all land on a water bucket to quickly get through the volcano. The villages would be a cool idea if you could save them from lava that was flowing and destroying their village. The volcano in the mountain would look very beautiful and it's also accurate to how they form. I think that this would fit so well into vanilla minecraft if we just had the right combination of ideas together.</p>",

The \"eruption\" is in the form of a weather condition similar to snowfall, but ash. It this weather condition would only happen in this biome, perhaps when it is raining elsewhere. The ash would collect in layers like snow and could be collected with a shovel and used for fertilizing crops. Crops would also grow slightly faster in a volcanic biome as the soil is richer.<br>Perhaps when thunderstorms are happening elsewhere, an actual more serious eruption could occur, where the ash is heavier and hotter. It could have fire particles mixed in which are damaging and possibly light you on fire, but not light the ground on fire or anything built. Perhaps this volcano biome could also be way more likely as islands than for it to be inland.</p>",

I only know about this site existing because In watched something of his.</p>\n<p>So what would a volcano biome look like to me?</p>\n<p>I believe that if volcano became a biome, it should be on the more rare side of the spectrum.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cool gameplay changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bits of obsidian could be found on the surface</li>\n<li>Wilted bushes would have another home, haha</li>\n<li>Sometimes, the areas could have petrified trees</li>\n<li>Creepy destroyed villages/temples reminiscent of Pompeii</li>\n<li>Volcanic gasses choke creatures out that get too close</li>\n<li>Hot springs.

Not saying make it gigantic, but I think there are too many possibilities here not to explore.<br>Much in the same way as forests have mountain forest, flower forest and tiaga (&amp; giant tiaga) forest styles, this has just as many potentials. So much so in fact that you might as well include it in a cave update pack. Call it the \"Subterranea Update,\" and put everything minerals involved in it.</p>\n<p>Here are my proposed volcano biome subtypes. -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Volcano_inactive</li>\n<li>Volcano_active</li>\n<li>Volcano_errupted</li>\n<li>Volcano_plains &amp; volcano_hills would be biomes surrounding the direct area.

More things that can be found there are obsidian, ores like gilded blackstone, a new one like topaz, being tiered between diamond and iron, i also liked the idea of villages around it, but would like them to be 1/10 of a chance and another 1/10 of it being ruined by a previous eruption, similar to Pompeii.</p>\n\n<p>Now since i have mentioned a couple new blocks, structures, etc, lets jump to those, shall we?\n<br />So pumice could be the first rocky block to be breakable by hand and also dropping itself, having bricks of this type, that would be equally fragile can add something to adventure maps aswell, also lets not forget to mention the ability to create moon-like worlds with pumice.\n<br />Now black sand will be used in making Witherstone, which will be a black sandstone variant, structures of which will be those ruined villages\n<br />Topaz will be an ore, tiered between iron and diamond, having its own toolset aswell. The special thing however, will be that you can craft more durable versions of bows and crossbows.\n<br />The villages around it will be either made of illagers or villagers, its structures being mainly spruce wood with blackstone, while the ruined villages will be made mainly of different types of Witherstone (normal, smooth, chiseled) </p>",

Another thing for ruined villages, would be that it has a shrine with an incompleted wither summon. The Witherstone will be immune to wither explosions btw. \n<br />The volcanoes have already been mostly described in my other comment, but to add something, it will have a chance of random explosions at the tip, which will also send black sand and lava flying and when the lava settles, it will produce magma blocks. The host volcano will be the biggest at 200 blocks in height, while the others will be around 120 blocks in height.\n<br />The magma chambers below the volcanoes will either be partially filled, completely filled or not filled at all. The magma chambers will add something to a future cave update aswell. They will be consisting of blackstone, rarely netherrack, cobblestone, glowstone and magma blocks, they also will have a 1/50 chance of spawning with a magma cube spawner.</p>\n\n<p>So that was part 2 of my ideas, make sure to read my other comment about my ideas. </p>",

(avalanche, dust storm) they need not be occurring often however if the player is able to prevent said event with building or an item it would make building and exploration way more interesting. Peoples way of life will be tailored to the biome they build in. It would provide a whole new risk and reward to building and would encourage planning a build as well.</p>",

Instead of having an eruption (Which would be hard to do in a systemic game like minecraft) what if there was just a boss monster that spawns, one in each volcano, that shoots streams of lava? Not lava source blocks, but just the lava, which will spread out and disappear after a little bit, so it doesn't destroy the world. This would be similar to an eruption, and possibly make volcanoes worth seeking and surviving. I saw a video long ago that suggested a \"lava kraken\" which I think would be a great addition. And since a volcano is a large structure, new players who aren't prepared won't be killed by it too easily. I notice that all overworld bosses or high level areas are clearly identifiable, so you only go there when you're ready. The volcano accomplishes that nicely.</p>",

Secondly, I don’t think that any nether blocks should spawn in the volcano biome, as that would defeat a large purpose of the 1.16 update. That means no basalt or blackstone. However, we should see new blocks like ash (maybe acts like snow/is farmable/can be used as fertilizer), gneiss, pumice, and maybe some new volcanic plants or flowers. It would also be cool to see some new volcanic animals like lizards or something. As far as the volcano villagers, I’m not sure they exactly fit into the Minecraft world all that well; perhaps if they were modeled after the Illagers, but even then I feel like having an entirely new series of villagers would be too much for one biome. I also don’t think that there should be snow on the volcanos just because I think they would fit better as a warm biome—perhaps spawning close to or in tandem with coral reefs. All in all, I love this idea, I think it would be fun!</p>",

I insist that normal stereotypical volcanoes annex other biomes slowly when they erupt and turn them into sub mini biomes within another biome, wooded biomes burn down and the wood of the tree becomes charred, this happens as an event like a thunder storms not something loaded in as apart of the generation mojang! The volcano should only annex things within a radius of 250 - 400 blocks that starts at the cauldera of the volcanoes. I want this to be added because there is nothing that makes the minecraft world feel truly alive at the current moment, it feels too static and i think that this is the perfect opportunity mojang. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Some of the islands could sustain small villages where the volcano has been dormant for some time, whilst other islands would be black/charred with lava and bubbles forming around it.</p>\n<p>Minecraft could show volcanic islands eroded through time, tropical islands and white beaches at sea level or just below sea level, as they slowly sink in the middle becoming part of the sea forming lagoons and coral reefs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Since parabolic-like shape of volcano inner wall still a lot of space. When black-stone/cobblestone contains +- equally spaced single blocks magma.Some small structures where the illagers 'work' , each for smelting, smithing, weapon production (grindstones), evokers on small wooden watchtowers that spawn vexes if you get near them.

Volcanic ash should also spawn in this biome, similar to snow, with ash falling from the sky during storms like snow. I think the ash falling from the sky would better fit the biome than snow on one side as you had suggested. It could be used in a recipe (improved on by one I found from a user on Reddit) along with Magma cream and bonemeal to create a soil that improves crop growth and yield. Of course, this is only one of many possibilities for which volcanic ash could be used. The volcano opens up the Earth and allows for this once-thought-to-be-extinct creature, the sniffer, to thrive again, in this lush, fertile climate. The sniffer comes and finds new seeds to help repopulate the area with new plants closer to the village, where it is safe to live. I think this would be a great way to implement the sniffer, a great way to bring two ideas together. I think an eruption might be too difficult to add to the game, but a simple, once already-erupted volcano, with active flows, might be a better route, as others have suggested.</p>",

There are two alternate, less complicated solutions for this. 1 is boring but u could just have the lava stagnant and look cool but not actually erupt. 2 is instead of a visual lava rising u could have something smaller like fiery rock projectiles and dark clouds blinding. As for the village, it's a cool idea but I don't really know. It is kind of unrealistic cuz I don't know why villagers would take the time to build a village next to an active volcano. This biome would also have to be INSANELY rare as well in order to make it unique. Last thought, there should be a new wood type that spawns in the land around the volcano and in the nether: the ash tree. The wood would be dark grey and grainy and can be crafted into all of the wood items.</p>",

This would not be too difficult if coded with existing mechanics. <br>These eruptions would simply be <strong>lava source blocks spawning</strong> around the top layers on the side of the mountains. Real volcanoes often have tunnels and cave systems that connect to the outside. Therefor, an eruption <strong>doesn't always include flying rocks but is often lava pouring out from the mountain sides.</strong> By increasing the <strong>lava flow speed</strong> within the entire biome once eruption event starts, could simulate increased temperatures. Post eruption could have <strong>ash downpour</strong>, which is basically <strong>snow piling up</strong>. For coding complexity, not too difficult as it is really applying the snow downpour with a different particle texture, and the <strong>effects</strong> of powdered snow replaced with the <strong>burn damage tick</strong> from magma as long as the player touches the ash. Coding the lava is also really not too difficult, as it only requires <strong>increased spawn chances</strong> with higher <strong>y levels</strong> and less <strong>distance from the centre</strong> of the crater.</p>",

I think these oasis should spawn near villages, since it would make sense to build a village next to a water source.</p>\n<p>The palm trees should be slightly bigger than oak trees in height, and have a structure comparable with acacia trees, but with different leaf generation. It could also be an opportunity to add bananas.</p>\n<p>Rabbits should be programmed to go to a water source every once in a while. Since the desert lacks water apart from oasis, they gather around the oasis, making it a good place to set up a rabbit farm.</p>\n<p>However, to counter this, I think it could be a good idea to add some sort of predator too, like snakes. Snakes can be spread over different biomes and also have the water searching behaviour. They can hunt the rabbits and are neutral unless provoked or hungry, more or less similar to their natural behaviour.</p>\n<p>So a rabbit rework, a new mob and a new type of tree. Could bring more life into the wastelands that are the deserts.</p>",

Oasis, given that they should have a respectable size in a simultaneously not very big but very common desert biomes would make oasis not feel like much of an occurrence, unless they are super rare. But even then, probably 200/500 block away in any direction there is another biome, which 99.9 percent of the time would feature water, if thats a forest, a savanna, an ocean or an iceberg.</p>\n<p>Also, considering deserts as dull and boring is definitely false. Mind you, in deserts there are the most structures you can find in a single biome, tying only the ocean biomes( if you consider the Buried Treasure one), which are the villages, the temples and the super rare wells. Lets also not forget the super rare Mesa&nbsp;<strong>Deserts</strong>, which you might consider a new biome, they are still deserts to their core, just very rare at that, &nbsp;with different blocks and generations.</p>\n<p>Honestly, if you look in other biomes, the desert is one of the least in need of an overhaul in my opinion.</p>",

Personally, I would prefer changes and additions to other, less focused on biomes, such as a savanna (they do have villages, but that's it as far as I'm aware) update or a birch forest update. Structures or features similar in style to the oasis idea would be nice, especially in these practically empty biomes. Actually, an oasis feature separate from the desert could replace a certain percentage of normal beach biomes or something, and be specifically where buried treasure spawns, to give us a little more to go on as the maps aren't always perfect (at least in my experience I have the worst luck digging those things up and with more to go on in terms of a specific landmarks it would make the whole treasure hunting experience a little less frustrating).</p>",

An oasis biome would be a great sub biome in the desert because it would make the desert feel great again. Great idea for the Cave Update, definitely worth the feature. The oasis is in biomes o plenty which indeed it could look like that one. Speaking of palm trees, these trees should appear in tropical biomes like the jungle and beach.</p>",

Here is an opportunity to add more flora that can give players builds a more exotic look, that can be planted on beaches and jungles to enhance your bases there. They simply need to give splashes of life in the desert, no need for it to provide an inherent benefit to the player. I think in many players minds, they are imagining a Date Palm, wrt Oases, which have this kind of pineapple looking topper. They would grow in the general area of a lake. Around the trees you could have Saw Palmettos, huge fans of pointy leaves. Very tropical and would look great for terraforming. Alternatively, agave or aloe vera. I think pointy is what we're after lol. These could be used for healing. Finally, we absolutely 100% need dune grass, a grass plantable in sand. Again, very useful for builds and terraforming. I am desperate for sand grass, I will make entire builds around glitched out grass on sand. Check out my Desert Flora suggestion for the details. Any grass blocks in an oasis should be a verdant green color, with a gradient to normal desert coloring. Finding a large Oasis and building there would give players some leeway with the color scheme when terraforming. I will also suggest a unique flower, every biome should have one IMO. Perhaps a purple/yellow Verbena. Purple, yellow, pink, green and earth tones, red terracotta/sandstone fit the desert in my mind. Endless possibilities.</p>",

Think a cactus or chorus plant. They should NOT be curved but stand up straight. I think for palm wood we can get that from a proper coconut palm tree in a jungle or new beach biome. With the Date Palm, you can shear the leaves, and get a kind of thatching, as a block or a mat. And also some dates. Date Palms can randomly grow 1 to 8 blocks tall naturally, being bonemealed indefinitely for larger heights. Granular control for builders is always appreciated :)</p>",

Healing water can be used to heal your hearts completely, or if you sit in the oasis , your hearts will slowly but surely start to regenerate . It also will have a lingering effect for one Minecraft day , then it will wear off . Also , when it’s a full moon , if you drink healing water or sit in the oasis , it will add on more helpful buffs , the catch is you will only get one helpful buff that’s randomly chosen , and it will also wear off in one Minecraft day . If you try to scoop healing water with a bucket , it will just turn into normal water . But you can craft a bucket of healing water using one bucket of water surrounded by 8 bottles of healing water , but if you place the water and try to pick it back up , it will turn back into normal water . (Something extra that isn’t necessary, maybe you can perhaps add silk touch to a bucket in order to scoop the healing water without it turning into normal water) . All this would be a great little but significant touch to Minecraft . It’ll give the dessert more purpose than just sand temples , villages , and sand . </p>",

All life flows from it. Of course, there would be palm trees, and wheat would naturally grow here. Camels, donkeys, sheep, and cows should commonly spawn here. I think this should be a good place to find donkeys because these are useful for travel. There should also be a village in this biome. Maybe the village could be massive and thriving so you could find tons of chests with lots of useful stuff. You could find iron, saddles, diamonds, apples, bread, gold, ect.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Maybe you could find brimstone deposits near an oasis. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brimstone would be a new blocks that could be found underground. Crafting four brimstone bricks around charcoal would create gunpowder. The block would be a cool yellow color. There would be polished brimstone, brimstone stairs, walls, slabs, bricks, ect. This would be an easier way to make firework rockets.</span></p>",

I always thought it was weird that you could travel to the underworld/h-e-double hockey stick (nether) an travel to the abyss (The End) but you could never travel to a heavenly divine local above everything. If Mojang were to create a sky dimension (please please please do) I'd think they should create something at least somewhat unique and a bit away from the aether or at least in gameplay. I have a few ideas that I invite mojang to openly take from me for I just wanna see the game grow for the better :).</p>\n<p>My ideas:</p>\n<p>A Sky/Heaven-like dimension update with bosses.</p>\n<p>GOAL: Create a new explorable realm that is the COMPLETE opposite to the nether and end. You come here in preparation of entering the End by gathering unique loot and gear that can easily combat the End and perhaps even the Nether.</p>\n<p>*Enter this new sky/heaven/aether realm via either a portal OR (in my opinon more interestingly) by sleeping on a magical bed crafted by rare item and enter it via a dream sleeping in this bed. This sky heaven realm can also be seen as a dream realm.<br>*Make this new realm have a <strong>wondrous, colorful, divine, peaceful</strong> aesthetic.<br>*Little to <strong>NO</strong><strong>&nbsp;hostile mobs</strong> except for bosses and their underlings.<br>*New Peaceful Mobs such as Angels who act similar to villagers but instead trade you high value loot like diamonds and gold.<br>*A new winged tameable horse-like mob: the Pegasus. Similar to horses in every way but they can glide and fly. <br>*Lowered gravity, you should often feel like your floating in a wonderous colorful land.<br>*New Holy Temples you can explore and acquire fancy loot. However there shouldn't be any risk of death for this is a peaceful realm, instead you should just solve puzzles and use your brain to navigate the maze-like design these temples could have. If you try to cheat and break the blocks in the temple before solving the puzzle, you should just teleport, outside the temple, back to the overworld as punishment.<br>*New divine, anti-undead/ender enchantments for equipment and weapons. Perhaps an enchantment to summon LIGHTNING like Zeus.<br>*Divine Weapons inspired by mythologies can be collected. Examples:<br>*An Excalibur-Like Weapon, a Holy Sword that does additional damage to undead and ender creatures.<br>*A Mjolnir-Like Weapon, a powerful hammer that when swung, shoots lightning.<br>*A Golden Bow that does way more damage than a normal bow, perhaps does fire/lightning damage by default.<br>*A staff that when used, heals you and non-hostile mobs/players around you (such as dogs and horses).<br>*Be able to create a bed in this dimension. When you sleep in it, you go back to the overworld. If you didnt bring a bed with you to this new realm, you can create one there with wool from a peaceful animal and wood from the exotic trees there.<br>*If it's a sky dimension, you should be able to fall off and sink to below the lands. Instead of going back to the overworld I propose two options: 1. Angels fly down and carry you back up. (It is a peaceful realm after all) or 2. you transport to a random location in the nether. Alternatively you could always never fall off and constantly float when not touching land and navigate the realm by slowly flying, crouch to descend and jump to ascend.<br>*The Bosses (i think at least) should resemble mythical figures like maybe Zeus or Odin or an Archangel. They should be a very touch challenge.</p>\n<p>Much of these ideas (or at least I think) alter differently to the nether and end. for example;</p>\n<p>*You cant place beds in the Nether or End but you can in this realm.<br>*The mobs of the Nether/End are hostile by nature or when provoked unlike the mobs of this realm.<br>*There's always a constant threat of death and uneasiness with the Nether/End. You always have to be on your toes and wary of your surroundings. In this realm however, not an issue.<br>*The Nether and the End have rather depressing atmospheres, looking depressing or menacing with harsh colors or in the case of the nether, not much color at all. More so washed out colors with a hint of purple lol. This realm however should look beautiful to the eyes. Exotic and full of color.<br><br>These are just some ideas I had regarding this topic. I'd love to see something similar implemented. If you like this idea, upvote this topic. Thanks for reading ;) cant wait to see your responses.</p>",

I like the idea of the present threat of falling off, so at the very least, I picture that when you fall off the skylands, you teleport to the over world. At this point, the player should have an elytra anyway.</p>\n<p>A&nbsp;<strong>passive mob</strong> you find is a <strong>pegasus-like creature</strong>, or a <strong>dragon</strong>. Maybe you use chorus fruit to tame them to finally give chorus fruit another purpose. They could act like horses in terms of taming too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To add another layer of creativity, the boss monster of this realm would be the <strong>Vex Boss or Vex Master</strong>. I'd like to see Vexes serve a bigger purpose as they seem random now. This Vex Boss would spawn upon entering the Skyland dimension, or you summon it, and it would be surrounded by Vexes. This mob should fly a lot, which could give a bigger purpose to finding an elytra in the end city before entering the Skylands.</p>",

The Vex boss is actually kinda genius if I'm gonna be honest.</p>\n<p>The more i think about it, having the threat of falling off is pretty fair for a realm i imagined as mostly harmless aside from bosses. You should always have a sense of danger when playing vanilla MC. That being said, i still feel as if the realm acting as a mostly peaceful world with little conflict to be a core feature of the world. Would i be heartbroken if Mojang decide to make it full of hostile mobs? No. It would be cool to overcome another challenge.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the Angels can have a similar mechanic to the Pigmen except WAY MORE SCARY and dangerous. Perhaps they attack you when you accidentally damage them just like pigmen or if you have a weapon out they attack you, and they stop attacking you when you put the weapon away. They should be able to fly and shoot you with spectral arrows. Perhaps there can be an infestation of End or Wither-like creatures that occasionally spawn in that the Angels aggro to and attack. Their spawn rates would have to be low tho or exclusive to the temples.</p>\n<p>Another idea, maybe you could get angel wings? Like you could upgrade your Elytra or get it from a boss.</p>\n<p>Thanks for reading!</p>",

Goblin mobs, fast but not very deadly but come in great numbers and will call others if attacked<br>- Poisined lands, a sort of swamp where the water is poisonous (will be a potion to withstand it) and will have amfibient mobs<br>- The Cliffs of Sight, gigantic vertical mountains with structures inside the vertical side (like a monestary) with snipers that can shoot arrows 50-60 blocks away (with of course no 100% accuracy as a skeleton).&nbsp;<br><br>I could go on, you get the idea.

The Emperors attacks would be a shiel bash that stops you from moving for 2 seconds, a chop with a huge Maquahuitl that does 8 hearts of damage. Before he attacks he takes about a second to put the weapon behind his back and before he attacks he lets out a roar so the player is signified of an attack.

Once you get to the dimension, you’ll spawn in one small island.

Pigmen Towns\n<br />A new mob called the pigmen will be found in the pigmen towns, bribe them with rubies to fight for you, cloth them, give them respawn anchors for them to respawn, they hunt killer bunnies and giants, when they’re at low health, they’ll retreat to eat food then start fighting again, they are passive.</p>",

You'd find a floating island with strong wind able to blow you off. Building straight up would be a great task so you'd need to use either an elytra with fireworks, or if you're more skilled you could reach it earlier by using ender pearls. The island could contain a sort of mechanism or puzzle to reach the new dimension. The dimension would be a chain of islands. The way you would travel around would be by either elytra, or wind, clouds, and mobs. I also agree with the idea of falling out of the sky would lead to falling from the overworld sky. The dimension would differ from the end in some ways. The floating islands would generate with mountains, forests, and cloud pools that can be scooped up for other purposes. Not only that but naturally generated structures perfect for elytra users would be lying around with loot. Hopefully this dimension gets greenlit everyone!!!</p>",

The skylands would be the opposite to the Nether however this dimension would be particularly dangerous and would come after the End (The Deeper End). New mobs would be added like the Skywhale and the Moa and the Cloud Ram (see suggestion for Cloud Ram on MC Feedback page). Other mobs would include the Glowbug that lights up in Sky Storms and the Skyfly that would be a butterfly found in the Skylands. New bosses would be added known as the Red Dragon and the Iceberg Dragon. New biomes would be added such as the Pale Oak Forest (greyish white leaves) as well as the Skyoak Forest (red, yellow and pink leaves) and the Skyhills and the Skyland Oasis and Plains. The void would teleport you back to the over world. The Skylands Dimension would a new level of difficulty to the game and would promote exploration in the world of Minecraft.</p>",

Since we are having the Caves and cliff update we are going to be seeing extended world height being increased so it would be appropriate to have a Sky island biome floating again fairly high with new trees sapling called,”(community names suggestions)” and have the trees leaves to give off an aesthetic  Vibe like a greenish cyan type of leaves. With the floating biome we could have new flowers with new animals that eats off from these new flower (but it wouldn't change the spectrum of adding new dye colors). The sky island biome will be rare to find on the existing biomes, but can be common to find them on the vast ocean areas.

Hopefully, Mojang can revisit that idea of introducing an Aether like dimension in the future update. My ideas are that this is the only dimension where you can place a bed and they won't explode. The nether is spewing lava with lava seas, and the skyland would be the opposite from that. It would be water instead and falling down from the islands. I would like new types of ores, mobs and maybe dungeons to conquer and to defeat a boss to get a reward.&nbsp;</p>",

Of course, the ore is a terrible idea, that would be too grindy, and some of the aether mobs that kingbdogs made were a bit too op, so that would have to be nerfed or completely removed, but overall, having the aether in minecraft is actually semi-possible</p>",

What if we look at the end dimension and its portal beacons. Now what if we made rare sky islands up in the overworld only accessible with the elytra which had these portals to bring you to the dimension. Now thats Fun!</p>",

Portals are very useful and an interesting concept, but when it comes to entering a completely different place, they aren't the only options. Beds are an example, but I will not go over them as they are a different story. However, elytra could have a use in getting to this dimension. The steps are as follows:</p>\n<p>Use elytra with rockets or use the wind and thermals to elevate. The ground below you will start to get brighter and brighter and the sky above you will get darker and darker, though not as dark as night sky.</p>\n<p>Once you reach high altitudes (above build limit) you are met with two problems; oxygen and cold. The Respiration enchantment will last you thirty ingame days up there, which is half the time it takes to get there. After that there are small islands that you must rest at. These islands have small building areas that you can place water in. If you have the potion of water breathing, you can replenish yourself with oxygen and carry on with the trip.

Although, I’m not sure what this new dimension would offer that would cause people to want to go there. Perhaps new bosses , and dungeons, or maybe you have to get new tools in armor in the Sky Lands because your other tools would be “too heavy”.

Not completely neutral, not completely hostile.</li>\n<li>There should be a portal using existing blocks in the game. No new structures required to enter the dimension (e.g: strongholds).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, from that point on I differ in opinion as to what or how this should be carried out.</p>\n<p>I personally think and agree that this dimension should be like it is&nbsp;<em>pure fantasy</em>. There should be no real world mobs, and since this is Minecraft, there should be little direct adaptations of preexisting fantasy creatures.</p>\n<p>As to how to get there, I have an idea that to enter you would need to make the portal a pool of water 3 x 3, grass blocks on the sides, and 11 of any flower type on all sides. Adding 1 wither rose to it to change the pool of plain water, into a portal.</p>\n<p>In the dimension there should be wild Allays, and in certain biomes, there should be wild Vexes. Perhaps there could be a mob that looks similar to the \"evocation fang\" that lives here as well? This would give the dimension a lot of lore, and as for the more peaceful biomes, it should be like a flower forest, though with multi colored wood.</p>\n<p>Just my opinion.&nbsp;</p>",

Here's what I think a sky biome could be like:</p>\n<p>It would generate at about Y: 295. This makes it not visible from the ground on 12 chunks of render distance, but still provides a fair amount room for stuff to generate without hitting the Y: 320 height limit.</p>\n<p>It would consist of big islands connected by chains of small islands that you'd have to jump across (slight parkour challenge).</p>\n<p>The main block could be a new cloud block (or even just snow).</p>\n<p>You'd want to go there for a new ridable bird mob. It'd be slower than a horse and have no storage. It could jump slightly higher or glide like an elytra when you ride it (but wouldn't be able boost like a firework.) New decorative blocks and possibly a new tree type (light blue wood?) could be obtained here.</p>\n<p>Various small structures (desert wells, small ruins, conduits) crafted from quartz, prismarine, and lapis (or brand new blocks) could be found scattered around and sometimes contain chests. These chests could contain enchanted iron tools, diamonds, gold, feather falling enchanted books, and a new 'Sky' armor trim. Stuff somewhat valuable to make it worthwhile to anyone that visits, but not too strong (like End City loot) because early game players could pillar up to here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, something like this (if the picture works).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/CoY7VS5_sSdBe0DU9_h36Q.jpeg\" data-image-token=\"undefined\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Now I know this is a well-requested, uh, request, but why do we need to add more fruits into the game if we’ve got one already , albeit misused. So, no cherry tree. Second, we already have a biome for the apple tree: the flower forest. Make the apple tree could only spawn there, or if we still want cherries the apple tree could spawn in forests and jungles. Maybe instead of just biome colors, there could be different biome textures for the flower forest. Grass could have little flowers on it, the leaves of birch and oak probably wouldn’t change, but the apple (or cherry) leaves would. My main point here is that we already have a biome and a fruit we could use.</p>",

Apples should get their own tree that will be dispersed rarely throughout forest biomes. Instead of leaves they should have apple blossoms which could be solid pink or could use perlin noise maps to change their color to a gradient of pinks and whites. We don’t need a new biome, we already have flower forests. They could spawn more frequently in these than regular forests and that would be perfect. Adding an entirely new biome into the game to fix one that we already have is illogical and Mojang said they weren’t adding new areas until they fix the ones they already have. That’s why they’re doing these biome updates and that’s really all they’ve done since 1.12. I hope y’all see my logic</p>",

They should have a grey-greenish brown color wood and dark reddish-brown planks. The leaves could randomly generate as colors ranging from hot pink to white. They might also have particles falling from the leaves occasionally. The trees would look like large oak trees. The cherries could be used to craft cherry pie (same recipe as pumpkin, except cherries in place of pumpkin)</p>\n<p>Envornment: The water should be bright blue, maybe it could sparkle? The texture could look as if there were blossoms floating in the water. There could be lotus flowers in the water as well. Villages, if any, could have a traditional Japanese-style look to them. There could be lots of ponds with koi fish in them and lots of trees. Bamboo could also be here.</p>\n<p>Mobs: I would love to see red pandas, slightly bigger than foxes and eat and drop bamboo, like pandas. They could climb the bamboo as well. I imagine they would be neutral, like pandas. They could have half the attack as pandas, 2 (easy), 6 (normal), and 4.5 (hard) with 10hp. There could also be mejiro birds, smaller than a parrot and tamed with cherries. These would be passive with 5hp. There could also be red-crowned cranes, maybe smaller than ostriches? I would also love to see koi fish of different variety skins, and is about the size of a large salmon. These would be passive with 3hp. Maybe even some kitsune or okami?</p>",

I would 100% rather see blossoming trees as a rare spawn within existing forests than as part of some weeb hodgepodge biome.</p>\n<p>I think seasons would be incredibly hard to implement in Minecraft, so having a blossoming tree (not necessarily cherry - could be anything!) as a rare spawn in amongst other trees is a better solution than trying to code trees to change with the seasons or having huge groups of colourful trees all together (I've seen the way sakura biomes have been implemented in mods and personally think it looks ugly). The players would still have the freedom to gather saplings and plant them en-masse if they chose to, or add them into flower pots, use them for Japanese-style builds, in Creative mode, etc.</p>\n<p>In terms of which existing biome these blossoming trees could be added into, my personal vote is the birch forest. The white trunks of the surrounding trees would tone well with patches of white or pink blossom, and the birch forest is currently pretty sparse - it doesn't spawn wolves like the regular forest or rabbits and flowers like the flower forest, so they can feel really empty and like they lack variety.</p>",

Maybe instead of slowing down the player it gives the Husks a speed boost.

This sand layer can work just like snow and digging it up with a shovel will create an item (like a sand pile) that can be used to craft a sand block. This would make cleaning up after a sandstorm worth the effort.</p>\n<p>Or you could leave it to make your desert base look cool.</p>",

Having a block or an item to protect or prevent sandstorms seems to be crucial to making this a feature that they will actually employ in the game as they have said before they are opposed to events that harm the player if the player could not trigger or prevent them. In this case, the sand accumulation would be very cool but would there be a way to get around this in building so people don't have to constantly dig out their builds? A wall or a roof? I'm not sure how we can make this event the player's fault/ preventable but if it's possible I think this would be an amazing feature.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The rain carries the cold, high altitude air temperature down to the lower troposphere, and cools the air there, however there is still a large mass of warm air below the rain cooled air, especially if the rain evaporates before it reaches the ground, causing the cool air to descend rapidly and pressing the warm air outward. The mass of the volume of air that is pressed out is comparable (though much, much more massive) to a locomotive moving at 80 km/h; it will not stop if there is a big pile of dust in the way of the railroad tracks. Sometimes, this air will move into unwetted areas which have loose sand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The duration and intensity of the dust storm is determined by the size and energy of the thunderstorm, as well as how dry and unvegetated the sand on the surface is. I don't know why I said this as it is probably irrelevant due to there being no atmospheric data values as of yet, but it could be, especially if storm clouds were put in place of the sky spontaneously turning dark and gray.</p>",

It sounds like the normal wind but with sand blowing along with it. The wind sound effect happens occasionally in most warm biomes like plains, deserts(when there's no sandstorm), and forests. The icy wind sound effect happens in cold biomes. it could be a more high pitched sound and have a slight icy noise behind it. All these noises would have a muffled sound if you are in a shelter of somesort.</p>",

Truthfully it would be nice to have a mob that doesn't have to be a known animal. You make these great creatures to fight or trade with.

If you want real birds that like water biomes you have cairns, herrings, all kinds of ducks, there are a lot of water birds. Flamingos are a Mangrove bird.

Maybe making it with light to dark brown layers on the sides and then, on the top of the block, it has this dried mud look. I think that there should be multiple types of mud. Mud that is similar to the powder snow that you sorta fall in and maybe instead of freezing, you suffocate or even drown, this mud however has a darker texture and might be hard to notice at night. Maybe you only fall in a little bit too. Mud that is a standard block that makes up the biome. It's similar to the grass block as it has a texture on top that represents a dried mud look and then a texture on the sides and bottom that is earthy and muddy (could be grey or brown (makes brown mud bricks). And then maybe, a grey mud block similar to the texture we have now that's found in patches everywhere (maybe this mud can make grey mud bricks). Maybe a sticky mud block with a slightly different texture that you have to keep jumping through. The mud alone will then add a lot for building, dangers in the mangrove biome, parkour, traps, etc.). Also, tall grass especially cattails, and closer together trees maybe, but mainly the MUD.&nbsp;</p>",

It could be a rarer biome like jungle, and as for looks, I can see a bluish grass and leaf colors for plants growing in the biome, as well as some new opportunities for structures using some fantasy themed blocks. This would give minecraft some more variety, and make it feel more unique when compared to other games with a similar genre.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I don't think the new gems will make the cut unless the next update is a cave update though...</p>",

This forest could have all sorts of new flowers and whatnot, but I have one MAJOR suggestion for this:</p>\n<p>I agree with some people that this wouldn't work so well as a vanilla biome, but it would work as a sort of Spirit World dimension. I like the idea of having a bright dimension. With the pixies or fairies that could be added, you could trade them diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, or whatever for all sorts of stuff. Or maybe you trade them magical items for the rubies or sapphires. OR, we could use a bartering system similar to the one being implemented with the Piglins.</p>\n<p>I would actually VERY much love to see something like this added into the game, but as it stands, I don't think this would ever work as a biome. But if there was some way to make it into a new dimension, that would work. I love the idea of having several vastly different dimensions we can visit. Maybe for this one, you have to use soul fire (from lighting soul soil on fire) and light up a gate made from a fancy new tree (like a cherry blossom tree). Or similarly to the End portal, maybe you have to find a gate tree somewhere somehow.</p>",

You would need to crouch and approach the griffin and feed it raw rabbit, it cannot be tamed but you get gain its trust, by doing ths. Once trusted it can follow you home and make a nest near by where it would protect you from hostile mobs and help keep the area safe. In the tower would be random treasure and also a new item called a manuscript that would raise an enchantment book level by one even if the enchantment is maxed out, the enchantment can only be raised by one time. Hoglins brought through from the Nether would become passive, piglings and zombie pig men would both burn in green flames. Fairies would also spawn and can heal the player. The biome would be full of trees and flowers, a new flower would be a lavender plant and bees would collect pollen from it to make lavender honey which would be used to make poison resistance potions. </p>",

Giving the player froglights, gunpowder/firework stars, broken anvils, and an assortment of non flower created dyes in exchange for enchanted books. Having a home generated underground, a library of enchanted books that can only be found if patience is achieved. Following the wisp first day will make its flame dissapear forever leaving you to find the library by luck, bringing back multiple enchanted books to a location a distance away from the other generated structure will eventually make the wisp follow the player when holding an eye of ender. If the wisp is brought to a campfire, fire, torch, lantern, or otherwise it will glow blue [or green I'd soul-flame] and hold the wisp when the eye is removed from hand.</p>\n\n<p>When the wisp is held inside a light source [campfire prefered?] Eating food and sleeping near it will make confirmation sparkles appear and any purple light generated by the wisp could\n<br />1.magic buff\n<br />2.transform different objects into more magical forms over time [ie. Bookshelves become enchanted bookshelves, enchanted grass revives stronger enemies dispite light level making players strategically place their wisp else need to replant grass]\n<br />3.

Phantoms could have different behavioral patterns in the fog and even spawn differently, such as spawning in the daytime or even when the player has slept recently. Endermen might not be hurt in the fog, but they could experience a weakening effect and have increased teleportation rates. Illager patrol spawn rates could be increased and have a chance of including witches on spawning. Witch spawn rates would be increased and have some added benefits, such as magical armor or faster regeneration. If fogs became particularly dangerous, ghasts could spawn near nether portals in the overworld and would disappear when the fog lifted.</p>\n<p>Theoretically, if witches and fog had a certain affinity, witch phases of raids could have a small chance of summoning the fog weather effect.</p>\n<p>Fogs would be terrifying (although the effects could be mitigated on easier difficulties) and add additional challenge to overworld encounters for experienced players.</p>\n<p>Nearby conduits would increase fog visibility.</p>",

This will definitely help now that they're changing swamps and want to make each biome have a different feel.</p>\n<p>Basically if there was only a little bit of fog, right above the water, maybe especially around lots of mangrove trees/roots, or fireflies. This fog would mainly disperse light somehow and maybe discolour it a bit while not hindering visibility unless it's extremely far out. This would make it closer to the concept art, which is gorgeous. (For example if there's still swamp trees farther out then maybe it's a bit hazy there but if it does open up to plains and birch forests then the fog opens up and visibility is the same).</p>\n<p>This should especially happen at night. The purpose of this fog is really just to look beautiful, not much anything else, since hindering vision so much probably isn't a phenomenal idea in the end when you can still try for great looking fog. The correct word of what I'm thinking is not steam, but similarly coming up. Probably just one block high or else it'd actually get in the way of vision. Maybe even less so that you can see if you stand in the water.</p>",

How about some lava insect wich will come out of the lava everywhere when the event happens? There would finnaly be a new mob being vulnerable to&nbsp;bane of arthropods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Another Idea: When you kill a ghast, there is a tiny chance it will spawn 3 - 6 small ghasts, wich shoot missiles similar to them from the ender dragon, creating an area wich will damage you, only that these areas are much smaller and take less damage to you. They are also in a firy red istead of purple.</p>",

Glowstone blocks can randomly fall and shatter when they hit lava or the ground. The lava spout ideas would be cool. When you're near your portal, a villager or other passive mobs could stumble in. They would express their confusion with expressions or particles seeming to say \"I'm not suppose to be here....\" then go back to the Overworld.</p>\n<p>For Nether Fortresses, maybe you see a random battle between two wither skeletons, two pigmen, or two blazes. It would be similar to a skeleton accidently shooting another skeleton. With the hundreds of pigmen nearby, maybe you can spot two baby ones chasing each other and play fighting. Also wither skeleton horse traps would be sweet especially if you avoid it and can tame a wither skeleton horse.</p>",

        "body": "<p>(1) The lava sea should have random fire spouts. An entity which spawns in any 3x3x3 section of surface lava (the 3x3x1 region directly above it would need to be air), produces some \"warning\" particles &amp; sounds for several seconds, then shoots a column of damaging flame directly up 10-50 blocks. It would set flammable blocks on fire, pass through solid blocks, and damage &amp; ignite any flame-vulnerable mobs caught in the column. After the spout there would be some more \"rumbling\" effects, then the entity would de-spawn. It would also de-spawn before spouting if its 3x3x3 region was no longer all lava, e.g. if the player dropped a bunch of gravel into it. Spouts should occur frequently enough that you would see about a dozen per (real-world) minute when overlooking a large section of lava sea. It's important it be an entity so (a) it could be spawned by commands, even in the Overworld and End, (b) it could be removed/moved/altered by commands, and (c) it could be prevented from spawning at Peaceful difficulty.</p>\n<p>(2) There could be a smoky/foggy weather effect where the visibility distance is drastically reduced, ambient light is reduced slightly, and smoke/fog particles appear near players similar to the tiny bubbles seen when underwater.</p>\n<p>(3) There could be another \"weather\" effect which is an earthquake. The players' view would visibly shake, making precise aiming difficult. Netherrack blocks with air below them could spawn dust particles the way unsupported sand/gravel do.</p>\n<p>Both (2) and (3) would be available in the /weather command, and would be controlled by the doWeatherCycle gamerule. Perhaps they could even be triggered in the End and Overworld, even though they'd not occur normally in those dimensions. Actually, come to think of it, having earthquakes occur very rarely in the Overworld would be a good addition, too.</p>",

Occasionally, when building or traveling in the Nether, you would see the Nether fog suddenly getting denser, and then the Nether particles start getting blown towards a certain direction, followed by constant howling sounds reverberating in the mega cave system that is the Nether, and then you realize that you are getting slowly blown to the side as well. You can press shift/sneak in order to prevent getting blown away or off of ledges. All piglins and baby hoglins caught in Nether wind will panick and try to find shelter from the wind. That being said, the local strength of Nether winds will be affected by the placement of blocks and will not be strong in places that lack space and will not happen in small, enclosed spaces.</p>",

If spewing horizontally it will bend the stream downward with gravity. Also any cracked magma block could become a regular magma block at any time at random and stop flowing lava, unless the cracked magma block has a lava source directly touching it, giving the player a potential way of using this for decoration or other uses. There could be a way to speed up magma block cracking if an anvil drops on it. I also wish that mining any magma block (cracked or not) would turn into a lava source, and if mining with silk touch, drops a regular magma block. Blowing up magma blocks with explosions could drop regular magma blocks to not mess that part up.</p>",

This idea probably goes against the concept of not ruining player's creations, but I still think it could be neat.</p>\n<p>- Reinforce the wither theme in the nether by including rare 'Wither Storm' events that spawn wither skeletons across the nether (possibly with better gear, or even involving the skeleton horses).

The mountains are much much bigger there, and I LOVE mountains but it bothers me that I'm stuck with hills and not those gorgeous mountain ranges. Also it would be pretty cool to see a canyon styled biome that can spawn in every biome available where it's just a massive ravine that has more grasslands below for some interesting natural barriers.</p>",

Perhaps flying mobs could have energy so you wouldn't always be in the air, and/or just rare to find.<br><br>I also think it would be awesome if you could somehow have a tamed giant animal, maybe the ancient civilization could have a way to tame them as well? Maybe to stop them from being too op, it'd be super rare to find the item you need to tame them, and maybe over time of being outside of the giant biome, they could shrink? Of course, if they did shrink, they should still be larger than the original mob, maybe twice the size. Maybe even cats, parrots, foxes, and other mobs that'd eat insects in realm life could attack you rather than being docile since you'd be like an insect to them.<br><br>Also, your english is great!

Rubies red, sapphires blue, amethyst purple, citrine yellow, etc.</p>\n<p>Also for a true cave structure, perhaps every so often the player would come across a small stone brick, chiseled stone brick room, it wouldn't be large. It would have a small pedestal with a chest on top of said pedestal with a stone brick stairway leading up. Hookwires with string will activate two dispensers that will shoot out arrows. The loot table would revolve mostly around iron ingots, gold ingots, redstone dust, lapis lazuli, very rarely diamonds as well as enchanted books. Maybe even a book and quil with coordinates for something nearby.</p>",

Imagine a big crater, kind of, but underground! Useful for underground home building, but more mobs spawn since they tend to be more open.</p>\n<p>We have sandstone, so why not make sandstone desert caves? They could contain underground ruined temples, or just small structures in general, along with your standard ores. And of course, fossils, both underground and near the surface. It is a desert, after all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Icy biomes could also contain icy caves. These could have frozen packed icy stalagmites on the ceiling, along with a standard icy floor, or just snow-covered stone. It's cold here, so colder mobs tend to spawn, such as Strays.</p>\n<p>Jungles get almost no attention, so why not also improve their caves too? Since jungles have an overgrown plant theme, they're caves could be filled with mossy cobblestone, and small amounts of dirt with plant life living up under. Melons could spawn in open cave areas, along with mini trees, maybe? Also, a lot more bats and cave spiders. Fossils and jungle temples are also much more common underground, and are covered in cobwebs. There could also be extremely rare towers that lead back to the surface with stairs. Covered in vines and moss.</p>\n<p>Ocean biome caves tend to be more waterlogged and flooded</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dimensional caves should also have a bit of a rehaul. First, the nether.</p>\n<p>Caves in the nether now contain gold! Where did all of those pigmen get their golden tools and nuggets? Well now we have an answer. Pigmen are also jealous, and tend to guard ores. If you try to mine some around them, they'll try to attack you. Obsidian is much more common in nether caves as well. In fact, very rarely, there could be an underground netherbrick shrine-like structure that may even contain a nether portal. Also, we need more nether ores, it's kind of barren there. The nether needs more updating in general, but that's off topic.</p>\n<p>End caves now exist in end cities, and they aren't like normal caves. Entrances spawn on the surface, and they aren't very big, but they contain good loot (in a shulker box), and are home to endermites, and maybe a few shulkers. We could call end caves \"Endermite nests\".</p>\n<p>These are just examples, however.</p>",

The mobs found in the caves can be easily dealt with after a while of playing. So to fix this I think there should be different types of very short but big caves underground. For example there could be a room that looks like a cave except there is a lot of lava everywhere, or a room covered in cobwebs and spiders. In these rooms could be some loot or an increased number or ores to persuade the player to explore it.</p>\n<p>It also might be a fun idea to increase the difficulty of exploring underground as you go lower and try to find more rare ores.</p>",

        "body": "<p>The primary problem with the underground is that is it all the same. The ocean had the same problem, and IMO aquatic update addressed the issue nicely by making different biomes, adding new structures and blocks, adding more life with plants and mobs, adding more reasons to explore (treasures and new resources/or resources being available in new places). Underground problem can be addressed the same way. A lot of people have touched on these in various posts, but I don't think they go far enough. So my ideas and my extensions to other's ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Underground biomes: Varied concentration of things that can be found in underground that players need to discover. biomes would determine the blocks used, resource availability, resource types, mob types, flora, generated structures, and general shape of the underground. Some simple ideas, from basic to complex: Solid rock (mostly filled in with various rock types, rich in iron, gold, redstone and lapis ores; Small caverns (essentially what we have now); large cavern (large underground space, filled with underground specific plants and rock formations, similar to nether); Hot springs (flat arrangements of rooms that contain water and lava lakes); Underground forest (a variant of the variant of large cavern filled with trees); Crystal caverns (branching caverns that are filled with colorful decorative blocks that cannot be found anywhere else, diamond ore could be more common here); ancient city (collection of small generated house structures that are buried in gravel, dirt, sand and stone with some gaps to make streets, ores are rarer, but there would be other loot to obtain);</li>\n<li>Underground generated structures: Not massive structures like mineshafts or strongholds, but small things (fossils, which are already in game work nicely), maybe a collapsed house here and there, maybe they are in form of small hollowed out space that contain unexpected things. Maybe even things like nether breaches that contain nether blocks in a small area and a broken nether portal.</li>\n<li>Cave formations: Rock columns, stalagmites, stalactites. Latter two have also single block variants. Various colored decorative crystals. Corals (with block and \"plant\" variants) are basically the equivalent of this in the oceans.</li>\n<li>Underground plants: Moss? Bioluminescent flowers? Root structures? Plants that are infused by other underground resources? (e.g. a blue flower that can only live within 3 blocks of lapis ore, or a red flower that glows when touched, or even periodically blooms to produce a redstone output)</li>\n<li>Underground mobs. Insects? Elementals? Maybe even a new class of mobs like goblins? One particular idea I have is a large worm, which is neutral by default, but is difficult to fight with. These would be rather large (long) mobs that can eat through rock (but not ores). When attacked in middle segments they would split. When disturbed they would attack with weak attacks, but their attack would apply various status effects, like poison, nausea, blindness, slowness, mining fatigue etc. When killed, they'd drop eggs that can be hatched into worm larvae, which are smaller passive variants that still eat rocks. These would be boss mobs that generate in certain chunks, and would not respawn once killed.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I guess I could put these as separate suggestions if that is the way we should do it. But it looked like this tread was trying to collect/consolidate ideas.</p>",

There could also be different types of existing ores like mossy ores (ores with moss) or frozen ores (ores covered with ice) the frozen ores would have to be put in a furnace twice. 1st to melt the ice, 2nd to smelt. You could also add zombie and skeleton miners (or diseased miners). These would be diseased miners who now roam minechafts waiting for their next victim.

Well they would be able to HEAR where the player is, like they would be able to hear you mining stone, ores, etc. and would go there. OR you could do that but also allow them to hear the players walking, which would be harder to hear, or running, which would be easier for them to hear. And maybe make them able to hear you easier if you are running and jumping. You could also make it so they can't here you when you sneak (shift) walk past them. I honestly do not know if it is possible, but it would be kind of cool, like one moment you are mining a block, and then the next moment you are being attacked by a monster, and it wouldn't stop chasing you because you are (probably) running/running and jumping away. But then you sneak out of it's way and it would keep going that direction, thinking you are still running, until it hits a wall where it would go back to normal again. Again, I don't know if this is possible, but if it is, it would add a bit of \"pzazz\" to the underground. And who knows? Maybe it would drop something special when killed.</p>",

These caves appear more dangerous as you descend into the earth (the things I am about to suggest will appear more frequently). These slightly rare caves have small pockets of lava around, pouring out of the walls of the cave, and streaming from the roof of the cave (maybe not the last one, or at least have it be rare). Magma blocks can appear around the lava pockets. Maybe even different variations of mobs, Ex: Heated Zombie: %50 chance to set player on fire upon hit, they do %5 more damage and have %5 more health. These mobs take reduced Knockback, as if they are stuck in molten stone/ore/whatever. The skeleton variations of these mobs have arrows that will also have a %50 chance to set the player on fire. In these caves there could be molten stone/ores, they have a slightly orange/red tint and deal damage as if they are magma blocks.</p>\n<p>Or, on them flip-side: Frozen Caves, the mobs for these&nbsp;take %20 less Knockback, are %15 slower, as if they are so cold they can barely move, they give you slowness upon hit, and when the creeper variations explode, they give the lingering effect of slowness around them, and the skeletons have slowness arrows. When you have been in these caves for to long, you will get slowness, and eventually nausea, and then finally, poison until you leave the caves.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Ok, 2 suggestions:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1. Vines generate inside (or at the opening) of caves. Caves seem like the type of place that are dank and and can only support low levels of life (ex: there are mushrooms and a few occurrences of grass/flowers). Vines seem like they are a perfect addition to the cave ambient. Imagine: vines flowing down the sides of a lava-lit ravine, or walking through a dark cave that has vines hanging down from the ceiling and walls. It could also provide a tougher challenge for battling mobs. Vine growth could occur in caves under a certain biome or in chunks that are special (slime chunks, chunks with structures in them, etc.) but only in one of these scenarios, not all.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Some villages spawn with a small quarry, but very rarely. These could spawn around the outer edges of a village and have something like a crane that leads straight down to a random(?) elevation (The crane is a structure made of blocks, NOT a suggestion for a machine that works like a crane. The size of the quarry would be something around 3*3 to 4*4, but the shape could vary. I don't know if it would be possible to do so, but the quarry could lead down to a mineshaft if the village is in range of one. Torches would be more abundant in the mineshaft closer the the quarry opening and become less abundant as the distance increases.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I don't know if these are plausible enough to work, but I though it might be an idea.</p>",

These civilizations may somewhat resemble villages, but are made with stone and cobblestone, and other underground minerals, but are broken down, like how in my first idea the residents left or died out, or like my second idea, but these \"cave villagers\" are not able to preserve the village, due to lack of resources. These cave villagers should have different outfits and professions then normal villagers. Maybe these lost villages could have new crops, maybe variations of the normal crops in Minecraft. Lastly, they could have containers buried around the lost villages, with letters or notes from the villagers, just to add more depth to the adventure.</p>",

For instance, 3 I think are good and their suggested strengths are: The ruby, the ruby should be as durable as the iron pickaxe, mabey more or less, but it should mine as fast as gold,&nbsp;<em>no armour for this tool</em>. It could mine up to emeralds. Their would be other tools, and they should be just like the pickaxe. Also you should add titanium, it would be quite durable, (it is 1 of the strongest metals in the world) but it should mine things up to emerald, yet mine really slowly. I think it should have a +20 armour, and it would have other tools as well. One more material, is a sort of dark quartz, like in the quark mod, (YOU SHOULD CHECK THAT OUT :D) if you check out that page you should see the description of it. I am not done with the topic of the mines though, I think you need&nbsp;<strong>way better minecarts</strong>. Minecarts should be able to connect, with like a chain item crafted from iron, and it should be able to hold up to 16 items in side it itself&nbsp;<strong>without a chest</strong>. Also better, more fluent turns. The way you would get the items in is by throwing them at the minecart, and to get them out, by right-clicking. Also I think a rare thing to spawn in mine<em>shafts</em> should be like a storage, it should have a 1/900 chance of spawning, because it would hold so many precious items, along with so many mobs. Items like emeralds, diamonds, and even a few treasure maps mabey? I dont know. But another thing. Kinda off topic but.. a /nickname command built into the game. self explanitory.

Every single type of biome would have it's own cave system, including rare biomes like the mushroom biome or the badlands! Plus, even oceans could have caves in them to explore! For each different cave system in each biome, there could be new mobs made just for it! Like for instance, for the mushroom cave system, you could have mushroom zombie that could be a Zombie like mushroom creature that when attacks, it get you posioned. In Arctic Caves Polar bears could spawn down there, and also new mobs like the infected snow golem which could be an evil snowman that could deal damage to you by trowing snowballs at you! They could also have a rare chance of throwing a ice ball at you, making you be frozen for 60 seconds. For Desert caves, there could be mummies that spawn that can poison you and&nbsp; could infect you with a virus when they attack. In village caves the could be miner villagers that can help you mine ores and undergound villager mine shafts and miner systems for you to explore with randomized loots that you would get if you went mining in a cave! Not only that but for every cave system their could be new versions of all ready existing mobs. For instance, there could be vampire bats, in which they turn into vampires, who can bite you and give you a virus that can affect you in various ways such as being dizzy, give you poison effects, or make you blind. It could vary and randomly generate the effects each time. Not only should there be new cave systems with different kinds of mobs in them in each biome...but every single kibd of cave system should have different kinds of plants, different rock formations,&nbsp; ponds of water and even streams of lava. there could also be formations of Krast in these cavers. Natural Snow biome caves could be have glaciers made of ice, and could make it that much more of a challenge for players to head into these caves. Not only that but, it would be cool to add in different types of ores that are naturally found in caves such as dolomite, gypsum. Krasts in caves are mixtures of limestone, dolminte, catalite and gypsum, and each time you find these krasts in caves, you could get either one of these ores...sometimes ever all four at once.&nbsp;</p>",

You could also then add a potion that makes you/mobs glow.</p>\n<p>-Crystal Caverns: A special place that is filled with gems and crystals maybe? If you could make ores spawn more often in Crystal Caverns then that would also be cool.</p>\n<p>Other than those biomes... Gems like ruby, sapphire, and topaz would be cool to go alongside emeralds... they would probably be mostly aesthetic by turning them into blocks, but maybe they could also be used to power beacons like iron, gold, diamond, and emerald... or maybe villagers will trade with any gem instead of just emeralds?</p>",

They would drop poisonous stingers that could be used to double the savage or time of positions of poison, or for a completely new posion.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Imagine how they could be used for maps and mini games.</strong></p>",

This would get rid of some of the annoyance caused by minecarts going the wrong way (or just getting in the way) when trying to use multiple carts at a time, which would also save players' time having to go travel by foot just to clear the rails every so often.</p>",

You could find rare \"painted\" blocks with all sorts of designs for each stone variant block (at least stone and sandstone). The designs could include 1 representative texture for each tool and mob in the game (you could exclude creepers and withers, sense the sand and redsand blocks already have them), hand and foot prints, and enchanted book letters. These blocks would be great for collectors (the archeologists in the community) and even better for mapping and mini games. They could also be combined with banners, so that you could customize waypoints on maps by placing a banner near a hieroglyph to give the waypoint the design of the nearest hieroglyph (within a 7 block ratios). For natural generation, a villager design could be used to represent a nearby village,&nbsp; a mod design could be used to represent a nearby Spawner and the type, etc... Players could also find all the other designs in reveans and random caves. This would definitely encourage people to mine in \"MINE\"craft. :D</p>",

There are also many rivers and lakes in the valleys next to the mountains cliffs and hills. You could also find many ores in this vast biom like&nbsp;Peridot, Agate, Blood Stone, Amber&nbsp;Cinnabar, Corundum, Sapphire, Zircon, Diamond, Garnet, Nephrite, Jade, Turquoise,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Opal. There would also be tea trees growing here.</p>\n<p>2: Everyday I wonder when Minecraft will get new ores here are some ores and ore crafting recipes that I think would improve Minecraft. Jade and peridot could be a scam for villagers so you would not have to use emeralds. Now emeralds would have a use they could be used to create a rhombus shaped portal made out of cubes that is activated by placing a pearl in an item frame on the top of the portal. (you could get a pearl by harvesting oysters.) (oysters would be a new item and mini block.) Once you did that the portal would be lit and take you to a dimension with a gigantic tree in it that had different ores and gems growing on it and other trees smaller than the big tree growing that would grow only one ore or gem. Some new gems would be&nbsp;Peridot, Agate, Blood Stone, Amber, Cinnabar, Corundum, Sapphire, Zircon,&nbsp;Garnet, Nephrite, Jade, Turquoise, opal, jasper malachite, sardonyx, onyx, salt crystals, Smokey quarts, rainbow quarts, silver, gold, copper, rohdonite, fluorite, rutile, and carnelian. You could find these in different bioms. All of these (except salt crystals) would be able to make tools like swords, axes, hoes, shovels, and pickaxes. Salt would be used in food recipes.</p>\n<p>3: Last but not least animals and mobs for the new Chinese biom. Maybe you could find a new kind of villager that harvests the tea trees. Eagles and other birds a mythical dragon that guards a palace on a hill that you have to defeat to get inside and different types of cows, chickens, and pigs on a small farm near the palace with a villager with them. Pandas would be for a different Chinese biom like a bamboo forest that was covered with mist. There would also be mist in the Chinese hills biom. These are my ideas and suggestions for the new updates that are coming.&nbsp;</p>",

You should also make more variants of certain blocks like andesite bricks, diorite stairs, and granite walls. Also at biotite, a block similar to the other full-block stones, (eg. Andesite) that is black and does relatively the same thing as the others. And there should be ores that can spawn in those blocks, like coal ore in doirite.

They would be made out of packed ice and blue ice, have dirt scattered throughout, and could either be their own biome type or could be littered above and below ground throughout the other cold-related biomes. These will also have hidden treasures inside, such as frozen villagers (thus adding in new villagers or just using the Nitwit villager as \"Cave villager\"), or large mineral deposits, or even pockets of water.</p>\n<p>Gameplay mechanics I'd like to see would pertain to villages and villagers. Some new structures that would be really cool to have would be underground colonies (underground villages basically), mineral deposits, and hidden miner rooms that can act as dimension rooms or treasure rooms. Another gameplay mechanic that would be cool to have in game versus coding it in with commands would be random events, such as droughts (which brings up another thing about farming, where crops can die if left out in the sun, or if it gets rained on it grows faster, things like that), meteor strikes, monsoons, solar eclipses, glacier melts, landslides, etc. Visual effects like lunar eclipses and super novas would be cool too. Another nice gameplay effect would only come after implementing the new set of dimensions described below.</p>\n<p>New dimensions I would like to have aren't necessarily dimensions, more like inner Earth access. The new dimensions would be \"The Mantle\" and \"The Core\". These can be accessed through little holes in the ground. These holes lie under lava and/or magma blocks in caves and/or deep warm oceans. These holes lead to \"The Mantle\". A new set of fire-related mobs would dwell there, but the blazes can live there too. Since the core can't be reached from the over world and \"The Mantle\", there would be little clues that someone else has already been there, left remnants of technology that could get to the core. New items would include radiation suits (radiation poisoning would be added into the game, basically a mix of both the poison and instant damage effects, taking away half of your current health and then killing you slowly, slower than poison, but can actually kill you, not leave you at half a heart), special underwater armor, special fire-resistant suits (Not the same as fire protection), and special tools to dig through the bottom of \"The Mantle\". There would be \"soft spots\" in \"The Mantle\" that allow for quicker access to \"The Core\". The Core consists of a lot of lava, and a ton of metals. There would be a floating ball randomly placed in The Core that holds many precious metals. This also means that new gravity gameplay should be added too, such as magnets (lodestone in every over world dimension). The lower you go, the slower you go as gravity is stronger the closer you get to the source.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm a little lazy to split this into many suggestions so if anyone wants to split this up and put it on the right feedback page, please do, just credit the original ideas to me please.</p>",

I suggest that we add a new way of transportation in the caves to make an exciting time for players who are done with mining that's&nbsp;why I chose to add two things heavy boots and light boots.</p>\n<p>What are these items do first&nbsp;off they are enchantments which can change the player's movement.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Heavy&nbsp;boots these make the player sink faster down into&nbsp;the water and not be able to swim but instead&nbsp;be able to jump like if you were out of the water and combine this with depth strider you would move slightly&nbsp;slower than swimming however if you have a speed potion you will move faster. I believe this would be useful since underwater caves exist and its hard to navigate downwards this method&nbsp;this would increase&nbsp;peoples interest&nbsp;in going to underwater caves and going underwater in general. I also believe that this will give Minecraft&nbsp;mapmakers a way to have underwater parkour.</p>\n<p>Light boots these make you light as a feather with this you can run on water for 3 to 5 seconds and float back up to the top of a body of water this also allows&nbsp;the player to perform a double&nbsp;jump helping to cross those big gaps in a cave instead&nbsp;of using&nbsp;scaffolding&nbsp;blocks. I would choose to add this to the game for the same reasons&nbsp;as the heavy&nbsp;boots it allows&nbsp;the player to go throw caves and underwater quite differently&nbsp;than a normal play and obviously&nbsp;parkour.</p>\n<p>Overall I hope you consider adding these two new enchantments to bring life to old items so life to feel new. thanks for reading.</p>",

These springs can give regeneration, but you can't be in the water for too long, or else it will burn you. I also believe that the Nether and the End should also have more ores. Nether Quartz is cool, but what about a name like Netherite? A material stronger than diamonds, or Chorus Armor, where you find Chorus Ore on the End Islands. These pockets of ore can form from the plants decomposing. They can also be a rare material in the End. Again, this can be the new End game material, giving players a need to come to the End way more often. However, Diamond Armor has a full bar of Armor points, so I think the new armor sets should have special abilities. These are just some of my thoughts.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, Can we have more Minecraft Music? Like Underground sounds? That'd be AWSOME!</p>",

Some of those traps could be arrow traps that use fitting tipped arrows and another trap would make a new type of golem corresponding to the temple. Other traps could fit the temple theme like fire traps in the magma temple, suffocation traps in the sandstone temple, etc.</p>\n\n<p>The main loot of the temple would be an item used to make a boss summoning item. This boss would be multiple entities with attacks related to the different temples. I don't know what they would drop but I'm sure you guys and gals can figure out something cool. </p>\n\n<p>Random stuff</p>\n\n<p>Hookshot are cool and good for caving. It would just swoosh you towards where it landed.</p>\n\n<p>A big hole. Just a massive steep cone-shaped hole going almost to bedrock. It would be really rare.

The strength of these effects can be upgraded with enchanting. When a radium item is placed into an enchantment table a special enchantment called Radeon will show up, and this increase the effect by 1 or more depending on what level the enchantment is. For example, Radeon 3 increases the effect’s power by 3. Radium blocks will also have a new use in red stone.

        "body": "<p><strong>here are some of my ideas for&nbsp; \"The Underground\"!</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>aesthetics</strong></em>:</p>\n<p>Make lava pools on the surface have a new type of lava, cool lava. This lava flows much slower, and it's texture looks like it has pieces of obsidian in it while the lava under ground is the same lava we are used to, only you take more damage from it. Also, make any water near lava evaporate like in the real world.</p>\n<p><em><strong><span class=\"ILfuVd yZ8quc\">Repurposeable</span> aesthetics:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Stalactites and stalagmites:</em></p>\n<p>Forms from dripping water or lava and grows over time but is also naturally generated in caves. These can be new hazards for caves increasing fall damage 2x . They can also be mined and used for base defense, or death traps for multi player servers. these blocks can also be used to make a spear, witch in turn will introduce different spear strengths. For example: you can use 3 sticks to make the lowest grade, the wood spear, 2 sticks and a stalactite, or stalagmite, formed from calcium salts, witch comes from dripping water, to make a slightly stronger spear, 2 sticks and a stalactite, or stalagmite, made of obsidian, dripping lava, for the third strongest spear, then the strongest would be the trident. You can also use 2 of these blocks and thier full block counterpart to make a stone, or obsidian, pick axe.</p>\n<p>Native tribes around the world would that live, or lived, near volcainos colect, or colected, obsidian shards to make spiers and arrows so I think, if you add these blocks to minecraft, the addition of different levels of arrows would make sense.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>poisonous mushrooms:</em></p>\n<p>gives the poison effect first, then adds nausea, then slowness, then blindness and stops after 30 to 40 seconds when the player is at half a heart, dang, after reading this back, it sounds brutal lol. This mushroom can be brewed into a new potion and drank to get the new advancement; slow and painful, or smelted to remove the effects.</p>\n<p><em><strong>structures and caves:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Mine shaft improvements:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Break rooms. this it where miners went to smelt ores, take a break, or to fix their tools. This new room comes complete with loot, a map of the mine shaft, a crafting table, a furnace, and a skull! great for moments when you run out of food, tools, resources, and sanity!</li>\n<li>Replace gravel with wood planks to keep the mine shaft looking nice.</li>\n<li>Add occasional skulls laying on the floor here and there for dramatic effect.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Stronghold improvements:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increase endermen spawn rate in and around the stronghold's chunks, including inside the stronghold.</li>\n<li>Add a super rare loot room with 5 silverfish spawners under the lava below the portal. It's got to have good loot with that security!</li>\n<li>Add a bed room. If theirs a library, someone must have lived there.</li>\n<li>Make a new villager that spawns in the bedroom and has the normal player model. and let the skin be changeable using a command that searches for a skin in some folder, then has you choose the file name and auto saves it to the world's folder. This would be great for fan made maps!</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Hot springs:</em></p>\n<p>Hot springs can be found on the surface, attached to a cave system, or in it's own little pocket, but are rare. This special water can regenerate your health as you step into the warm, soothing, pool of relaxation. It will also cool into regular water when put it into a bucket or bottle, but can be reheated in a furnace. Now I want to take my own soothing bath!</p>\n<p><em><strong>Ores and other materials:</strong></em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>tip: </em>make diamonds and quartz capable of generating around lava pockets, tubes, and lava filed ravines. It only makes sense seeing as their formed as a result of intense heat and pressure in real life. diamonds should also generate in the nether because of the pressure and heat.</p>\n<p><em>Clear Quartz</em>:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/lGmQCCXQigZvfyPp9f_-lA.jpeg\"></p>\n<p>Can be found where ever normal quartz is found, sometimes mixed in with quartz veins. When made into a block and placed, hostile mobs will try to avoid it unless your right next to it. If you put the crystal in your off and, hostile mobs will hesitate to come near you, or try to get away if you sprint toward them. Clear quartz will clear any negative effects if the player is within 5 blocks of it, but reduces the effects of enchanted items as well to give it a fair balance. And, so it isn't too op in sea temples and the ender dragon fight, cause it to turn into regular quartz after a short time in and around those areas. the texture would almost as clear as glass but with scuff marks. and make it possible to turn then into panes as well, this could look good in builds! I got the ideas for this from the real life history of clear quartz crystals, witch people used to believe it was ice that didn't melt. it's said to be used to keep evil beings away, have healing properties, and block magic spells.</p>\n<p><em>Redstone:</em></p>\n<p>I know what your thinking \"redstone already exists in Minecraft!\" Well, just hear me out. Have redstone ore drop redstone instead of redstone dust, but can still be crafted into redstone dust. Red stones can be used to make these items:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>redstone torch</li>\n<li>redstone block</li>\n<li>redstone dust</li>\n<li>redstone charger (charges until it reaches level 30, twice the maximum redstone level, then releases it in a quick burst then starts recharging. The max charge can be changed in increments of 5 by right clicking the device.)</li>\n<li>piston (the redstone replaces the iron and the dust goes in the same slot. may need to change the texture for this one.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some new redstone dust recipes as well:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>piston</li>\n<li>red quartz dust (redstone dust mixed with clear quartz dust to increase the distance a redstone signal can travel by 20 blocks. great for large redstone contraptions, but you only get one dust per recipe. The clear quartz is is used to keep the signal from disbursing into the air, keeping it contained it the redstone.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>leaverite:</em></p>\n<p>An ore that you leave alone. Leaver' right there!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mobs:</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>Tip:</em></p>\n<p>remove the eyes from spiders that spawn in caves, they don't need them in the dark anyway.</p>\n<p><em>Hostile mobs:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>whip spider:</em> <img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/_ib7pnvbmqAMRTfgst0O3g.png\"> Spawns in caves, some mine shafts, and rare spawner rooms. the whip spider will use it's large pincer looking mouth to grip it's victim, immobilizing it while it feasts. can be killed like normal spiders.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Cave dweller:</em>A creature that has no eyes or pigmentation because it only lives in caves. It uses antennae to listen for it's pray. This strange creature also uses clicking sounds to hear the shape of the cave, like echo location.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;<em>Passive mobs:</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<em>Cave fish:</em><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/i_D1ZOCQkx8gJEe-L7syGg.jpeg\">A small fish built for a cave life stile. the lack of light means that they don't need eyes, or color for that matter, in fact those features use up too much energy, energy that they need to survive due to the small amount of food they find. They use moving water to feel any obstacles that may be present, similar to echo location.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>thanks for reading my post, I aprecimate it.</p>\n<p><em>(extra spacing removed&nbsp;~nb)</em></p>",

        "body": "<p>One of the things I think you should add to caves is limestone. Limestone is a stone that would only appear in a 15 block radius of a water source and can only spawn in caves, also limestone can’t spawn near water that the player places, it has to be natural water. Limestone can be mined with any pickaxe and when you break it you harvest it but when you break it water appears at the spot you broke it at,( the reason for this is because it spawns near water and water can get soaked up into the stone, that is why all my mentions of limestone will be water related, it’s because it has water inside it) Limestone can be turned into a decorative building block for structures. Also if limestone is touching dirt with seeds in it or with a sapling on it the plant on that block will grow 25% faster because of the minerals that are in the limestone, also instead of having water to grow you plants limestone can because it has water in it, also villages have a chance to spawn with limestone on the farms. You can’t place fire on limestone because of the water that’s in it. If you get an empty bottle you can fill it up with the water in limestone, but you can’t fill up a bucket with the water in limestone because there isn’t enough water in it. You should also add little underground rivers and small lakes so that limestone can spawn more frequently. In those rivers and small lakes you can find moss it can be mined with anything and give you half a hunger bar. Also blocks with moss will make you slide if your running because it’s slippery. Also the water in caves should have a slight darker color just for looks :) Another idea is stalagmites and stalactites. Water will drip from them and bats will also sleep on the tips of them, they can only be mined with a silk touch pickaxe, and limestone can spawn in a 5 block radius of them. Another idea is chains. It’s a simple feature to mainly make it look better, but chains can spawn in strongholds and other cave structures and you can mine them with any pickaxe, you can also climb them. They can hand on the walls like a 2D thing or hang from the ceiling as a 3D thing. Also mobs can climb the chains. Also chains can be smelted into iron ingots, but you can’t craft chains. Another idea I have is that mushrooms can spawn on the ceiling and you can place them on the ceiling. Those are all my ideas for now, I hope you like them and maybe even consider adding them. These are some changes that would make the game look better but also help it’s gameplay.</p>",

I want to consider this all one idea as it all revolves around the nether and&nbsp;optimizing it.&nbsp;I would now like to share my input on this month's theme:&nbsp;<em>The Underground</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>Looking through the comments under this thread, I've noticed that the nether is scarcely mentioned. I believe we need to refresh on the nether, and though changes have occurred back in 1.10, that never added any new flare to the nether. Which is why I propose this: What is preventing the nether from having microbiomes?</p>\n<p>I know the nether is supposed to be comprised of generally cavernous structures, with seas of lava and towering fortresses among them, but for what little stretches of land there are I could totally see crags of rock, perhaps a new one; grayish in tint and standing among other pillars of stone. Inside said microbiomes could have increased spawn rates of magma cubes, blazes, and perhaps even wither skeletons!</p>\n<p>Continuing to develop this idea on the nether, There are fruits to be found in the over world, and even the end too! What is stopping the nether from having a tasty crop of its own? You may be asking yourself, \"Well what about nether warts?\" I have not overlooked these ever-precious brewing ingredients. I propose another crop, or perhaps a snack crafted of nether warts, magma cream, and perhaps even undead flesh. I lean more towards a crop of some kind, but I still need to develop that portion of my idea.</p>\n<p>I suppose I'll add my concluding thoughts as I don't want this to be a monotonous, long, overlooked thought. Naturally generated structures. Let's be honest here. The nether is a little lack luster. Find a fortress, get some warts, farm blazes, head home in preparation of the end. In our vast oceans of lava, and especially following the Update Aquatic, there could totally be ships to be raided! There are already end pirates (those nasty levitating creatures) and soon to be fallen ships, in the over world oceans, perhaps throw some Illagers on board with heaps of loot, loot tables similar to that of end cities.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you so much for taking the time to read this!</strong></p>",

        "body": "<p>having played Minecraft for years now I have a few idea's for how to improve the underground locations.</p>\n<p><strong>Lighting Changes</strong></p>\n<p>so one of the big things I think that would improve the undergound. is dynamic lighting to the torch item you hold in your hand. adding the ability to mine with only one torch but doing so making it more risky. the light wouldn't prevent mobs from spawning but allows a more atmospheric feel to exploring cave systems.<br><br><strong>New Dungeons</strong></p>\n<p>so the old dungeons with the mob spawner are nice, but having more themed ones would be nice, especially in conjunction with a further suggestion. basically have the blocks be different. maybe have more underground structures that spawn different mobs. for example. the traditional dungeon spawns zombies. but if your in a desert and find a fossil there can be a change that it is hollow inside and it will spawn strays or husks. or even have something similar to the Keep where the end portal is but with each room presenting a new mob with another chance for good loot. how ever having only 2-3 rooms in total.</p>\n<p><strong>Underground Biomes</strong></p>\n<p>so this one is a BIG one. instead of just having dirt gravel water lava and a few stone varients. why not have biomes specific to under ground. they don't need to be huge. just have them scattered to change up the feel of the explroation of caves and ravines. an example. if your in a jungle have the ravines have a change to have vines and large trees at the bottom. maybe even have grass or cliff ruins built into the side. inside some of the ruins could be loot and mob spawners.&nbsp; while also serving the purpose of adding more variation to the underground pallet.</p>\n<p>Several mini underground biomes could be<br><br>Desert areas:<br><br>underground oasis ((a large opening with some trees and a large pool of water surrounded by grass. Vary rare and has floating sand that has a small opening leading to sunlight))</p>\n<p>Fossil Wastes ((Fossils are more common but smaller and without a distinct shape))</p>\n<p><br>Buried Pryamid ((basically like the pyramid above but has a spawner with husks or even a new zombie varient Mummy))</p>\n<p>Jungle Areas:</p>\n<p>City Runes ((Ravine))<br>Overgrown Cave ((more over grown. lots of grass and vines. even some leaves and small trees.))<br>Aztec mines ((more leaves and stone supports instead of wood))</p>\n<p>etc...<br><br><strong>Nether Portal Ruins</strong></p>\n<p>a type of small structure that would be fun to stumble upon is broke nether portals ((missing a few blocks)) with a rare chance of finding an active one. it would give players a reason to explore the nether more. and having random portals spawning in caves would make the world feel more alive. <br><br><strong>Stalagmites and Stalatites</strong><br><br>Simple and would add more atmopsphere. <br><br><strong>More Craftable Stone Blocks</strong></p>\n<p>this is kinda nitpicky at this point but as this is my last suggestion I will keep it short. while I love using many blocks for builds the one thing I feel is under appreciated is the lack of stone block crafting. especially around andesite diorite and granite. adding more crafting for them would make them more appealing. so for my last suggestion. add in Stair half slabs and pillar varients for all the stone blocks. it would bring more reason to the underground and even adds some freedom to making more structures underground.</p>\n<p>This concludes my suggestions, I hope that you don't find it too much and that at least one of my ideas has given you some fun ideas for the update. ^.=.^ either way I am looking forward to the underground update.</p>",

        "body": "<p>People that play minecraft probably had the problem of *being lost down in really vast cave systems*, and I really want caves to have *different looks from biome to biome*, or even have different biomes dedicated for caves! I have a few ideas.</p>\n\n<p>1. *Different Kind Of Stone In Different Areas*\n<br />  A lot of people would agree with me on this; Stone, Andesite, Diorite and Granite are just not enough. They don't help in navigation (like the main point of this suggestion) because they're scattered in different places, what you can do is create more varieties of stone in different areas (for example, limestone would be great in certain areas that are close to water.) the limestone could also be used for building, for it has a unique shade of gray, it sure will be useful for building, it could have associated limestone bricks, slabs, stairs or even walls maybe (I'm talking broken limestone, a limestone counterpart of cobblestone, or you can call it something else I guess.). Marble would also be a good addition, a rare block that would only show up in (I don't know) areas real deep down under sea level maybe. It could have a beautiful white color and have associating bricks, stairs, slabs, etc. with the block as well.</p>\n\n<p>2. *There should be some kind of map or compass or an escape rope that brings a player to the surface*\n<br />   It clearly says it, an *ESCAPE ROPE* would be perfect for desperate situations when you're in immediate need to reach the surface, but it would be a challenge to craft. It could be crafted using a different kind of string dropped by some different kind of spider, a string that would be more sturdy than the normal string the spider drops. A Giant Huntsman Spider (a legitimately real creature) could appear *rarely* (making escape ropes really challenging to work on) in very dark places underground and boast a larger size than the typical spider, he could walk slower but deal so much more damage and cause nausea or something, when killed he could drop 1-4 spider eyes and 1-5 \"Cursed String\" or something like \"Hunter String\" or \"Sturdy String\" or whatever. Then a lot should be gathered (like 6) to craft a typical rope, the rope will be useful too because it will act like a ladder, but every block doesn't need a barrier block to hold on to, just like vines but you can climb them smoothly, they will only need one block to hang onto and they could be built down to be a climbing rope. But when you collect a lot of these ropes you can grab yourself something like a blaze rod or a potion of night vidion, I don't know and put it in a crafting table then put many ropes with it then ta-da! You have an escape rope! </p>\n\n<p>3. *Special ores in special places underground*\n<br />  Minecraft clearly needs more ores than it already has, an overgrown cave could randomly generate under jungle biomes and contain a huge amount of gold and a new ore *copper* that can be used to craft armory and weaponry but can be used most effectively in redstone for they can be crafted into blocks and *can transmit redstone signal through itself*, this would be useful for redstone contraptions, for it would remove random holes that are way too hard to patch up, there should be more ores of different varieties that can transmit redstone signal, but in different colors and textures so players can fit these kind of blocks in builds really easily, but these ores should still be available for crafting weaponry and armory. Ores like aluminum could appear in very low temperature biomes, like ice spikes or things like that. A made-up ore special for minecraft should be created as well. </p>\n\n<p>4. *I would like to have Titanium in the game as well :D*\n<br />   Titanium could be an extremely rare ore (rarer than diamonds) that would be stronger than diamonds. A full set of Titanium armor could have more armor points than the maximum can provide, there should be like more sprites of armor points made specially for more armory like titanium, it should also have tools and weaponry that could reach amazing heights (lolwut) a titanium pickaxe could break obsidian like how an iron pickaxe breaks cobble walls. It can also have a total of 5000+ uses. The titanium axe could break 2 blocks of wood at a time for it's impact. A titanium shovel could dig as fast as you can dig in creative, and a diamond sword could deal around 9 or 10 damage.</p>\n\n<p>upvote this please</p>",

        "body": "<p>There are a TON of things that could be added to the underground aspects of Minecraft, here are all my ideas that I want for the underground.</p>\n<p>A Cave Update: This is probably something people have wanted for years. The games more \"Craft\" than \"Mine\". If this were to happen, I have some ideas for the title of the update.</p>\n<p>1. The Wonderous Underground update</p>\n<p>2. The Cave Update</p>\n<p>3. The Underground Expansion Update</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cave Biomes: This needs to be added. There are a ton of biomes that could be added to caves for instance...</p>\n<p>1. Desert caves: These caves would consist of sandstone and sand. The dungeons in them would be made of different types of sandstone</p>\n<p>2. Sone variant caves: Caves should have the chance to be made of mostly granite, diorite, andesite, marble, and limestone (More on marble and limestone later)</p>\n<p>3. Jungle Caves: The caves would be found in jungles, and would have cobblestone on the walls instead of stone. These caves would be \"Overgrown\" and would have grass, vines, and sometimes even melons scattered about these caves. Bats would spawn more often in them as well.</p>\n<p>4. Icy Caves: In freezing/cold biomes caves should consist of ice, packed ice, blue ice, and snow.</p>\n<p>5. Prismarine Caves: Underwater, there should be a rare chance that a cave is made of prismarine and dark prismarine.</p>\n<p>Tar: This is just something, that I think is a good idea. Tar would generate below Y=40. When you stand on tar, it gives you slowness 5 and takes away your ability to jump. They would also be perfect for traps!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Azurite: A new ore that's a little purple, and a little blue. It cannot be made into armor or tools but would be overworlds equivalent&nbsp;to quartz.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Prismarine ore: This ore can only be found in ocean caves, it is slightly rarer than iron, but when you mine it you have a chance to get 2 different materials. Sometimes when you mine it you get 2 prismarine shards, others you'll get 2 prismarine crystals, and if you're lucky, you could get 1 of each.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stalagmites: These would make caves more alive. There are different types of stalagmites, for each biome. There would be sandstone, red sandstone, ice, stone, granite, diorite, andesite, cobblestone, limestone, and marble variants of the stalagmite.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Limestone/Marble: These would be new types of stone similar to granite, diorite, and andesite. They could be made into polished versions as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stone variant slabs/stairs/walls: This one's simple Polished stone variants, and regular stone variants should have slabs, stairs, and walls.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stone variant bricks: Granite, andesite, diorite, marble, and limestone should have bricks, chisled, cracked bricks, and mossy bricks variants. These would also have slab, and stair variants.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Torch Lever: Is it a torch? Is it a lever? BOTH! The torch lever is a lever that looks like a torch but acts like a&nbsp;lever. This would be great for hiding things.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bone Torch: A new type of torch that's made from a bone. It would also have a lever variant.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cave Creepers: These creepers would act like normal creepers, but would spawn below Y=50, and would have a different texture depending on what biome that they&nbsp;are in. They would take the texture of a surrounding cave block, for instance, snow for the icy caves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More Dungeon Variants: Dungeons should come in different variants depending on the biome they are in, and come in different sizes. The first one I don't need to explain, but the second one I do. The dungeons we have now should be considered, small dungeons, but they could also be medium and large as well. The medium and large ones would have more loot, more rooms, more secrets, more spawners, and maybe even better loot. They should have 1-3 torches/bone torches in them, but there should be a torch lever inside it as well. The torch lever should open up a secret door, to 2 different things, a ton of mob spawners, or a bunch of loot. The torch lever thing&nbsp;is only for large dungeons.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mossy Sandstone: A new mossy version of sandstone, that's all it is.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mineshaft Variants: Mineshafts should be made of different types of wood, depending on the biome above it. For instance, acacia wood, for an acacia biome.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Stronghold Variants: Strongholds should be made of granite bricks, andesite bricks, diorite bricks, marble bricks, or limestone bricks, and prismarine bricks depending on the biome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Miner Villagers: These villagers would spawn in villages. These villagers would actually have good trades. You could trade for loot from dungeons, ores, maybe even some blocks, or stalagmites. Similar to the farmer, this villager actually does something! The villager would leave the village for 0.5-3 Minecraft days, and would go mining! This villager would also have its own building. In this building, there is a chest, and in that chest, there could be minecarts, rails, pickaxes, maybe even ores. The building would also look like a mixture between a mineshaft, a village home, and a blacksmith. If there's no cave near the village, the villager would mine under it's home. It would also spread the wealth, or the ores it finds with fellow villagers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nautilus Shell Fossils: This is more like an ore than a fossil. It's a single block and it's more rare than diamond. It's only found in ocean caves, plus when you smelt it you get a nautilus shell.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Nether and End caves: Caves in the Nether, and in the End. The Nether caves would have quartz, and gold ore inside of it, and the End the caves would have purpur ore inside of it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Purpur ore: This is a new ore that spawns in the End, and when mined gives you a material that is used to make purpur blocks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ore Background Changes: Ores, before mined, would take the texture of the block that surrounds it the most. For instance, if there's sandstone surrounding it, you would find an ore block that has the texture in the background of it that looks like sandstone. When mined though, it would keep the background texture it had when mined. In the creative inventory, there are two types of the different ores, the original stone background, and one with no background. The one with the stone background would have the same name, but the one without a background would be called the environmentally friendly version. The environmentally friendly version would do the background texture thing, but if they are in the air they have the stone texture.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Instant Furnace Enchantment: This enchantment is for pickaxes, axes, and shovels,&nbsp; and would instantly smelt any block that can be smelted. For instance, it would turn sand into glass, or iron ore to iron ingots, even logs to charcoal. This enchantment would be very useful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Gold ore in the Nether: Gold ore should spawn in the Nether, it would explain how zombie pigmen get their golden tools.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bone Fossil: Another block fossil. This one is as rare as gold, and when smelted it gives you a bone.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More Fossil Types: In the End, there should be a dragon fossil, and in the nether, there should be a ghast fossil.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Underground Witch Huts: It's a witch hut that's underground, and looks a little different. It's bigger, has loot, and has more witches.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Large open areas: In caves, there should be large open areas, great for underground building.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Silverfish Infested areas: Inside caves, there should be random spots that have a bunch of silverfish in them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bat Caves: These are caves infested with a bunch of bats.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drill Power Enchantment: This is an enchantment for shovels and pickaxes when used, it mines a 3x3 area.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ore Compasses: This is a rare compass that's only found in large dungeons, and very rarely in miner huts in villages. it has variants for almost every ore. It comes in gold, emerald, diamond, prismarine, nautilus shell, redstone, lapis, azurite, and quartz variants. The rarest being emerald, and the most common being prismarine. These would come in handy when mining.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dark Prismarine Bricks: This a block for the prismarine themed stronghold that's found underwater, and can also be crafted. It would be a really cool decoration block as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Furnace Minecart Uses: Furnace minecarts need a use, and you should be able to use them to smelt things, and when it is smelting, it would give you a speed boost slightly faster than an activator rail and would go even faster when on an activator rail.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Rails Underwater: Rails should work underwater, but they would move the minecart much slower, and furnace minecarts wouldn't work.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Hot Blocks Deep Underground: When you are really deep underground you should find magma blocks, lava, obsidian, and warm obsidian scattered about.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Warm Obsidian: This is a type of obsidian that has an orange tint to it instead of a purple. When you step on it you deal damage as well.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Underground Villages: These would be villages that are underground, made of entirely stone, and rarer than normal villages. They would have a lot of miner villagers, around 5 per village, and would have&nbsp;the other villager types as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are all of my ideas for the underground! Hopefully at least one of these gets added to Minecraft! ;)</p>",

        "body": "<p>A lot of the new ores and crafting sound like various mods already available.&nbsp; But the resistor idea sounds good as a new crafting block.... 3x3 of bottom three a base (either Stone or cobble or even planks) a Redstone dust in middle #5 position and one to five resisted value blocks in any place of the remaining empty spaces&nbsp; &nbsp;i suggest two values (1, 3)which gives a 1 to 13 range plus 15 which could be cheated to 14 since a resistance of 15 is always 0&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;..&nbsp; This has a benefit of never worrying if too many blocks are in resist slots because if second value were 4 or 5 then values of 20 or 25 would be possible and possible coding bugs could ensue.&nbsp; &nbsp; The main question would be which blocks to use .&nbsp; That depends on how expensive/cheap one wants to make the resistor. I'd even think allowing ANY slab and stair to be used, as long as they match block type&nbsp; with slabs = 1 and stairs = 3 this fits Minecraft lore/theme since a slab is half a block and crafting stairs uses three half blocks each ... If the base is&nbsp; whole blocks of the same material, then you even have the ability to visually change resisters by making the look according to the type of slabs, stairs and blocks used .&nbsp; Just like the various doors, trapdoors, slabs and&nbsp; stairs already in vanilla.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I also think the vanilla resistor should have symbols on it to indicate it's resistance.

The normal ore texture isn't going to mix well with sand-or other stone types and adding ore for all of them is going to be annoying. (How would they even stack?)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So I suggest the ore texture changes atleast with the biome (like grass) or even better, if possible, with the surrounding blocks. The way it would work would be, when an ore generates next to a different stone type it uses that stones texture.(If it's next to multiple it's random)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>When building, if you put a stone down next to a stone type it will change to that texture and stay that way, but if you put a stone type next to an ore nothing happens.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Adding this would make room for many possibilities.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You could make granite, diorite, andesite and other new stone type pockets (Marble, limestone and basalt) rarer and way bigger. So you could have caves made of these stones and still have ore in them. This would already add more variety.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This would be amazing for the underground cave biomes. A frozen cave would be made of frozen looking, slidy stone blocks, ice and snow. The ore would generate touching this icy stone and would turn to that texture. For hotter magma caves the stone texture would have magma veins going through and the ore would change. Overgrown caves would have stone coverd in vines and the ore would change. Etc.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other suggestions I have.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spider cave. Just full of cobwebs,spiders and loot.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Dragon cave. Way to finally add the red dragon to the game.&nbsp;</p>",

These lakes and rivers would be in big caverns and would be filled with unique animals, eg: blind cave fish and cave lobsters. They would also have luminous plants growing.</li>\n<li>Cave Centipedes. These would crawl around caves and underground passages and would try to \"bite\" people and the \"bite\" would poison the player.</li>\n<li>Health Gems. Deep underground, players could find the ore to this rare gem. When mined it will drop one health gem, more with a fortune enchanted pick-axe. When your health is low you could \"eat\" this gem and your health would go up significantly.</li>\n<li>Collapsing Mine Shafts. These would be generated structures that could only be found in deserts. They would be like normal mine shafts but with a sand roof which would collapse when a players walks over a hidden tripwire hook.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Update Aquatic Suggestions&nbsp;<em>(removed- please stay on topic ~nb)&nbsp;</em></strong></p>\n<p>I would love if my ideas were considered and would be thrilled if my ideas were made into actual game content.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Both can be up to 3 blocks high and if you break the \"base\", other blocks will break too (kinda like cactus).</p>\n<h2>2. New mobs</h2>\n<p>1. \"The Lost (soul)\". It spawns in mineshafts and other underground structures. It looks like a ghost, it is pretty quick, but weak and gives mining fatigue or slowness when hit by it. It drops a soul fragment, which can be used to craft souls. Meanwhile, if you surround a seed with 4 souls, it will make a nether wart and if you surround sand with 4 souls, it will make soul sand.</p>\n<p>2. \"Void Monster\". It spawns in caves near bedrock.&nbsp;It is strong and burn in sunlight. When killed, Void Monster drops an item which can be used for haste potions.</p>\n<p>3. \"Undead Miner\". This mob can be met in mineshafts or in other (maybe new) structures and is a mini-boss. When player gets close to the miner, they receive blindness effect (similar to Elder Guardian giving mining fatigue). Also, when hit, miner teleports behind the player and/or he throws pickaxes at player.</p>\n<p>4. \"Miner\". This is just another variation of villager. They will sell some stuff from underground, like diamonds, lapis, etc. The last trade can be a map of stronghold or another underground structure.</p>\n<p>5. I think that bats need to have some more use, not just exist. They can be hostile and/or drop something useful, for example, a bat wing, which can be used for levitation potions.</p>\n<h2>3. Miscellaneous</h2>\n<p>1. Foggy weather. idk, just y not.</p>\n<p>2. New enchantment. I still didn't some up with the name, so let's call it \"potato\".&nbsp;It can only be found in dungeons. \"potato\" can be put on pickaxes and (maybe) shovels. This enchantment can break 3x3 area. Also \"potato\" can break only stone (including diorite, etc.), ores and netherrack (for pickaxes), sand (all 3 variants), [coarse] dirt and gravel (for shovels). This enchantment is not&nbsp;compatible with efficiency.</p>\n<p>3. Coloured light souces. Colored crystals or redstone lamps would be cool.</p>\n<p>that's all.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Ever since i started playing Minecraft (Beta 1.6.6), i haven't seen&nbsp;many improvements on the Underground and the Ores with their respective Tools, with the exception of Emeralds, which at the moment still only serve the purpose of currency in Minecraft. I always wished there was more to mining/caving than looking for these very few ores that Minecraft, after all these years, still has.</p>\n<p>The easiest way in my opinion to make mining more interesting again would be adding <strong>New Ores and Tools</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>rebalance the current ores</strong> to fit with the new ones. My vision for the ores would look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Copper</strong> [Speed:&nbsp;5&nbsp;| Harvest Level: 2&nbsp;| Required Harvest Level: 1 | Durability: 192&nbsp;| Armor Points: 10]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Iron</strong> [Speed: 6 | Harvest Lv: 3 | Required Harvest Lv: 2 | Durability: 256&nbsp;| Armor Points: 12]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Topaz</strong> [Speed: 7 | Harvest Lv: 3 | Required Harvest Lv: 2 | Durability: 384&nbsp;| Armor Points: 13]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Silver</strong> [Speed: 8 | Harvest Lv: 4 | Required Harvest Lv: 3 | Durability: 512&nbsp;| Armor Points: 14]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Amethyst</strong> [Speed: 9 | Harvest Lv: 4 | Required Harvest Lv:&nbsp;3 | Durability: 640&nbsp;| Armor Points: 15]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Gold</strong> [Speed:&nbsp;10 | Harvest Lv: 5 | Required Harvest Lv:&nbsp;4 | Durability: 768&nbsp;| Armor Points: 16]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sapphire</strong> [Speed:&nbsp;11&nbsp;| Harvest Lvl: 5 | Required Harvest Lv: 4 | Durability:&nbsp;896 | Armor Points: 17]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Platinum</strong> [Speed:&nbsp;12&nbsp;| Harvest Lv: 6 | Required Harvest Lv: 5 | Durability: 1024 | Armor Points: 18]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Ruby</strong> [Speed: 14 | Harvest Lvl: 6 | Required Harvest Lv: 5 | Durability:&nbsp;1280 | Armor Points: 19]</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Diamond</strong> [Speed: 16 | Harvest Lv: 7 | Required Harvest Lv: 6 | Durability: 1536 | Armor Points: 20]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obsidian would then require a Pickaxe with mining Level 7, so you still need diamond tools to mine it. Also this way, the progression to diamond takes a lot longer and you can't skip many ores since you always need a pickaxe with the right Mining Level so you can progress further to Diamond.</p>\n<p>The gems between each of the standard ores from the list (<strong>Topaz</strong>, <strong>Amethyst</strong>, <strong>Sapphire</strong>, <strong>Ruby</strong>) serve as a much rarer alternative to the standard ores which always first need to be smelt, while the gems don't. Like Diamond you only need to mine the gem ore and you get a gem which you can immediately use to craft new tools. Great for long mining trips where you don't have much&nbsp;inventory space to carry a furnace with lots of coal to smelt all the stuff you found.</p>\n<p>The gems are almost as strong as their ore counterparts. Only slightly stronger in durability, mining speed, damage output with swords/axes, etc. And since they're much harder to find than the metal ores, they also should have a much higher enchantability. Like Iron has for example an enchantability of 10, while Topaz has 15, so always <strong>50% better enchantability than their metal ore counterparts</strong> while being <strong>50% rarer than their metal ore counterpart</strong>.</p>\n<p>The next thing would be way more complicated and harder to make, but i think it still is something very important that Minecraft needs, and that would be <strong>Underground</strong> <strong>Biomes</strong>.<br>Ever since the release update 1.7, which added all those biomes that made Minecrafts overworld much more interesting again, having caves that fit those biomes is a great addition. It would make seeking out for specific biomes way more worth it, especially since you also would have those cool looking caves in these biomes.<br>My suggested underground biomes would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Overgrown Caves</strong>, which generates in forests, birch forests and roofed forests and the ground is mostly covered in coarse dirt, new moss dirt, some grass here and moss stone. There are also trees spawning in and their leaves would cover almost the entire top of these caves.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Jungle Caves</strong>, which of course would only generate in jungles and consist mostly of vines, moss dirt, moss stone, some special underground jungle trees here and there, many mushrooms, etc. grass can also grow there.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Swamp Caves</strong>, which are mostly flooded and have new mud blocks which make you sink and suffocate. These blocks can only spawn in swamp biomes and their respective caves and nowhere else. The caves are also like the jungle caves mostly covered in vines.&nbsp;Giant Mushrooms can also spawn in these caves but only when they have enough space.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Sandstone Caves</strong>, which would generate in Deserts and as the name says, consists mostly of Sandstone and Sand. Tombs, ruins,&nbsp; and dungeons generate here and fossil structures are way more common to find.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Terracotta</strong> or <strong>Red Sandstone Caves</strong> which generate in Mesas, mostly made out of Red Sandstone, Red Sand and all kinds of Terracotta that can be found in Mesa Biomes. Just like the normal sandstone caves they generate ruins, tombs, dungeons and more fossil structures than other biomes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Icy Caves</strong>, which generate in cold areas such as ice plains/mountains, cold taigas and ice plains spikes, and consist mostly of packed ice and new ice cobblestone and such. Strays spawn way more often in these caves.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Volcanic</strong>/<strong>Magma Caves</strong>, which generate where lava would normally be. It consists mostly of magma cobblestone, magma blocks and of course lava. The magma cobblestone blocks emit light and you can stand on them without taking damage unlike on magma blocks</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Crystal Caves</strong>, a rare cave biome which consists mostly of Crystal Blocks, a new Block only for that Biome which can be used for decoration, the crystals glow slightly too. Maybe the crystals can be used for other stuff too?</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Glowy Mushroom Caves</strong>, also a rare cave biome where huge and small glowing mushrooms grow, the ground is covered in blue glowing mycelium, which can only be found in this rare biome. The glowing mushrooms can only grow on the mycelium found in that biome and they glow bright enough, so that no monsters can spawn in these caves. The glowing blue mushrooms could serve as a new brewing ingredient.</li>\n<li>More <strong>technical caves</strong> like <strong>underground rivers</strong> and <strong>underwater waterfalls</strong> which can lead to enormous <strong>underwater lakes</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these underground biomes i listed here, should be rather rare and not too big in size. They can't generate beyond their biome border, so you can't find small portions of a jungle cave in a desert biome for example. They're completely bound to their biome they spawn in.</p>\n<p>That's all for now, i could come up with way more than this, but then i would sit here for several hours. And sorry if this post is way too long. xD</p>",

        "body": "<p>Large caves should be added to Minecraft. But it wouldn't fit under 64 (if not, less) blocks. They need to lift up the space between the surface and bedrock to about 100 and expand the and double the height limit. Another idea is that Mojang has confirmed the addition of a \"<strong><em>Red Dragon</em></strong>\" coming to Minecraft as a new boss in the future. A large cave filled with stalagmites and stalactites would be perfect with a pedestal around a radius of 10 blocks in the center. On that podium should stand treasure which consists of iron, gold, emerald, and diamond blocks, along with a new block:&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong><em>Ruby</em></strong> block, which is the first time the player encounters this block as ruby ores don't spawn. The player should be ready for a serious battle. As they approach the pedestal, when they are just about to get within mining range of the precious gems, the ruby block, which one of them stands on top of the pile of crystals and gems, emits a light which sends a beam up towards the top of the cave, and then stops, and around the cave, on 10 carefully placed stalagmites and stalactites (facing each other, stalagmites on the bottom and stalactites on the top of the cave) shoot a beam of light to each other and stops in between them, causing something like an end crystal, but slightly different and red instead of purple&nbsp;to spawn. They all shoot light towards the center of the room,&nbsp;all in sync and then when all have shot the center, the ruby once again shoots a light towards the ceiling and stops going forward half-way there, and it emits an explosion which gives the player blindness for 3 seconds. When the player looks up, it now sees the \"<em><strong>Red Dragon</strong></em>\" soaring through the cavern. The precious blocks are now encased in a cylinder of red glass, which is unbreakable, and that won't disappear until the dragon has been slain</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Red Dragon Statistics:</p>\n<p>Health: 250 HP (125 Hearts)</p>\n<p>By the way, the crystals heal the dragon, so take those out first if you want a chance at beating this beast.</p>\n<p>Attacks:</p>\n<p>-Fire Breath. It will launch a fire&nbsp;ball at you.</p>\n<p>-Fire Barrage. It will fly to the center of the cave, and spin and launch fireballs in many areas. It is a modified version of Fire Breath.</p>\n<p>-Claw Grab. It will fly down to you and you will be carried by it to the highest point in the cave, and then you will be dropped and fall, likely to your death if you aren't equipped with armor with serious enchantments. Also, when it is carrying you, you will take half a heart damage every 5 seconds it is carrying you (like it's claws are hurting you while you are in them).</p>\n<p>-Rapid Charge. It will come down to you at a fast speed and deal a lot of damage if it manages to hit you.</p>\n<p>It will cycle through these attacks, using Fire Breath most of the time. It will use its more powerful attacks when low it is at low health.</p>\n<p>Drops: Tremendous amount of experience, and a Red Dragon Egg (they should change the current dragon egg to Ender Dragon Egg) which has a red texture. You will also be rewarded with the blocks.</p>\n<p>Ruby Block: It can be used in the base of a beacon and also to power one, and can be used to make Ruby Tools and a Sword (no armor). They are stronger than iron but weaker than diamond in both strength and durability, leaning closer to diamond in stats.</p>\n<p>Red Dragon Egg: Like its cousin, the Ender Dragon Egg, it is useless and it is only used for display.</p>\n<p>Red Crystals: Can be crafted like an Ender Crystal, but in stead of an eye of ender use a ruby (9 from a ruby block).</p>\n<p>Re-Summoning of the Red Dragon: It will give you more than enough rubies for more than 10 rubies, and just place them on the stalagmites. It will use the same processs as when first encountered.</p>\n<p>I left this here to just say it, but there is the exact same post somewhere.

        "body": "<p>A few days ago I posted two topics; one which was unfairly told to be put in another section (even though it was already posted to the section they asked me to post it to) and another that they told me to post here for easier access to it. It refers to \"The Underground\" as a brand new dimension and could bring RPG players to the minecraft scene. Here is the full article I posted:</p>\n<header class=\"post-header\">\n<div class=\"post-title\">\n<h2 title=\"Additional Story Elements (Hardcore) with Underground Overhaul (was: Sandbox Story)\">Additional Story Elements (Hardcore) with Underground Overhaul (was: Sandbox Story)</h2>\n</div>\n</header>\n<div class=\"post-content\">\n<div class=\"post-body\">\n<p>Am I the first to come up with this idea? Very well, I'll have to make this really good if I want y'all on my side. The idea I am thinking of is just a small one, but it will change the game in a very big way. I simply want some sort of story and character to minecraft. You can make your own using mods or commands, but I want a built in story.</p>\n<p>You were created by magic and have to level up in order to gain the strength to carry certain items. Your first set of items you may carry is anything that is wood or less. Coal is impossible to pick up and stone is still a little too heavy for you, but with the experience of mining the coal you'll gain the strength to pick it up.</p>\n<p>With your new tool (stone) you will be strong enough to break harder ores. As you mine coal ore it will slowly give you pieces of coal that you can carry. You must craft these into the bigger coal which can be turned into your most valuable tool; the torch.</p>\n<p>The torch has given you the ability to keep mobs at bay (hostile mobs are afraid of light level 8+) and gives you sight as you wander the terrifying depths of caves. You must begin to build a home, but try not to make it out of too much wood or else it may burn down from your best tool's unknown ability. After building your new home you'll have to hide there and store away some goods for the time being.</p>\n<p>Once you have slept a night away you may then head below the coal line. You have gathered enough strength to gather some iron pieces which need to be turned into ingots. After you have created your first set of ingots; you must make an iron tool and weapon. Having these will keep you safe in \"The Underground.\"</p>\n<p>The Underground is a very scary dimension that was created by placing torches in a cross and setting fire to the most central block. The rift will only be open for a few days, so gather all you can before hauling back home with your new gems.</p>\n<p>The gems you have just acquired will aid you in crafting better gear. The&nbsp;<em>better gear</em>&nbsp;will make you able to move faster and break things easier. There are five gemstones that give you these new abilities, but each have their own way of doing it.</p>\n<p>Amethysts will slowly drain the life of passive mobs in order to give you stronger arms and higher movement speed.</p>\n<p>Rubies will slowly drain away your own life to give you a much higher strength and movement speed. (Ruby is the best, because it harms you to make you stronger.)</p>\n<p>Topazes will slowly decay random items (or stacks of items) to give you a weaker version of the ruby improvements.</p>\n<p>Emeralds will remove random ores around you to make your arm strength higher and your feet move faster.</p>\n<p>Diamonds will kill hostile mobs swiftly at the cost of half life and will make you faster if you are moving on the surface of water.</p>\n<p>Once you have conquered that dimension; it is time to head onto the next one. The Nether is a very scary place, because it has five creatures that you will only see there. (Endermen no longer spawn in the overworld.) If you conquer this one, you may have to take a very long break.</p>\n<p>Your strength needs to be at its highest and you'll need several different gems before you head off to the final dimension and beat the final boss. You will receive a random letter in a random chest that tells you to walk in a specific direction for 500 meters. (east, west, north, south) When you do so, you'll be greeted by a guardian.</p>\n<p>This guardian won't be too happy to see you, but he will not attack you; unless you attack him. Descend into this guardians cave temple and be greeted by the corruption portal. (Changing the name of the End to the Corrupted Islands.) If you can defeat the dragon and win the day, you are free to roam and explore forever.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is more-so a change for the way Hardcore is played. If Hardcore mode was like this then you would get a lot more RPG players to want to play this. It'll be one life and one epic story.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

Adding \"rifts\" instead of portals would make the game a bit more fun. We could use specific underground elements to make these rifts and they would only last from 10-60 minutes. Another thing is the rift could close if you leave the minecraft world and hop onto a new one. Just saying that making rifts instead of actual portals would make the game have a more dynamic setting. Unless you were in creative of course.</p>",

They would have no cobwebs, functioning rail lines, minecarts everywhere, and a new mob (The Miner) which actually expands the mine. The Miners would ride minecarts to the center of the Mineshaft, and put the loot in chests. There would be different types of Miners:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Guards: Guard Miners protect the central area, which is where ll the mined items reside</li>\n<li>Crafters: Crafters make tools, furnaces, crafting tables, chests, and ore blocks, as well as smelting ores</li>\n<li>Builders: Builders make the wooden supports, as well as the central mine areas with storage, The crafters would actually give them the items</li>\n<li>Miners: Armed with pickaxes (Iron), these are the ones who actually do the mining</li>\n</ul>\n<p>During world generation, 13 by 13 rooms would be generated. These would be 2 stories. The first floor would be 2 blocks tall. Each wall would have a 5 block wide tunnel for mining, and a double chest centered in the 4-block area between the tunnel and the wall. These chests would be double-stacked, making a total of 16 double chests. In the center would be a 1 by 1 pillar, with ladders on every side. There would be torches throughout the room. On the upper story, the walls would be surrounded with furnaces and crafting tables. The Mining Camps would generate with 1 guard, 4 miners (One per tunnel), one crafter, and 1 builder. The miners start with 1 iron pickaxe, 32 torches, and 1 stone sword. As they mine, they collect materials which are deposited into the chests. The crafter makes new pickaxes, torches, and swords using these. Hostile mobs would attack Miners, so the miners get stone swords to defend themselves. Every 100 blocks of tunnel, the builder would make a new Mining Camp, which would spawn 3 more miners, 1 crafter, and 1 guard. The guards would have iron swords, and become hostile to anything that harms a Miner or the Mining Camp. Miners would only have 8 slots for mined items, and would return to base to place items back in chests often. Minecarts and rails wpuld be the main transportation method, and the Builder would place them along every new 100-block tunnel. Unfinished tunnels would not be equipped with rails.</p>",

        "id": 360001587471,
        "body": "<p>Here is my suggestion, changes to how furnace minecarts work and a new minecart, plus crafting table changes and 4 new machine type blocks! right now the furnace minecart is pretty useless unless you can't find gold, which is pretty easy to get and most people just make powered rails first before even thinking about furnace minecarts anyway, but i think we should change them to act like furnaces, kind of like how minecart chests act like normal chests. this would allow you to smelt items on the go, and like chests furnace minecarts would work with hoppers, a hopper on the top will put items into its input slot, a hopper on the side will put items into its fuel slot, and a hopper below the track will take items out of the output slot, pretty much like how non-minecart furnaces work. this would allow you to compact automatic systems, so you no longer have to have a giant auto smeltry connected to a chest minecart, but the furnace minecart will smelt and transport the items at the same time. now for the new minecart, the crafting minecart! it could as be called the workbench minecart, as crafting table minecart doesn't really roll off the tounge that well. at first it might seem pointless, why would you need to move a crafting table around? well it is because this would not work like a crafting table would, atleast the crafting tables we have now. no, but its about time to make minecart fully automatic, so both workbench minecart and crafting tables will have a new button which will toggle on and off \"imprinting mode\" this mode will make it so items you place will stay in the crafting grid but won't go out of your inventory, but when click on them like you would pick them up they would stop being in the inventory, kind of like a blueprint and like how alot of automation mods handle auto-crafting tables. while it is in this mode you are not able to craft anything with it by hand, but connecting hoppers into it will automatically craft, how will this work? well in \"imprinting mode\" 2 inventories will also pop up on the crafting table, you can place items in one and the crafting table will use them to auto craft items, and it will output into the other inventory, i don't feel like this is overpowered because the recipe book does the same thing practically in a single click and it is toggleable like the recipe book. hoppers connected to the top and sides will take items out of chests and put them in the input inventory in the table, a hopper connected to the bottom will take outputs from the crafting table. i don't feel like this is very diffrent from minecraft because brewing stand and furnaces already do this, so why not crafting tables? it is also not neccesary to do this in any way so if you don't want to use the feature you don't have to. and this is where the workbench minecart comes in, you can automatically pick up raw items from the mine, craft them on the go automatically, and have your finished goods stored safely in the chest. the last 4 items are the most risky to be added and will also enable you to fully automatically automate the game, the first item is what i call a \"harvester\" and they could be diffrent based on what job they do, I.E treecutter, farmer, miner, etc. they would be expensive to make and could also possibly require you to give them new tools or they will stop working, and could also need fuel to run. this is another place where the auto-crafters could come in, the harvesters will harvest materials and then the auto crafter system&nbsp; will turn them into tools for them to use, and the harvesters could mine coal to fuel themselves, it could be possible to also upgrade them into \"robotic harvesters\" which use diamond tools instead of iron, which the normal harvesters could use, which means the robotic miner is the only one that can mine obsidian. these upgraded harvesters can be really expensive but they will be able to move to the recources and can be set using a new type of item like a \"programming device\". this device would also be fairly expensive to craft. you can use this to set a \"gathering point\" for the robot harvesters with by left clicking one point and left clicking again on a diffrent point that will make a square, all harvesters will harvest blocks from right in front of them to 3 blocks higher than themselves, but the robotic ones could detect if there is valuables, i.e extra wood on a tree, coal, 4 tall sugarcane, and harvest them aswell. so keep your robotic harvesters away from your floating log hut or coal ore mansion. once the robotic harvesters harvest something, and their inventory gets full (1 chest worth) they will go to a hopper or chest you set to them by right clicking it with a programming device, by the way you could bind a programming device to a robotic harvester by right clicking it while the programming device is unbound and left click on empty air to unbind it. the next item is some form of redstone wiring to replace redstone that can go up walls vertically, or just allowing redstone to go up walls vertically, the redstone wire could take extra recources and redstone dust itself would be unplaceabe and only used in recipes, but redstone dust could also just go up walls, its a more simple edition but it would make redstone so much easier to do. the next one is a pipe, either to replace a hopper, or make it to where pipes can only work if conencted to a machine and you cant drop things directly into a pipe, and a hopper can be connected to a pipe. aswell as hoppers still used for redstone contraption purposes. pipes are basically hoppers but they have the ability to make items (and maybe fluids if a pump is added into the game, and a drain block is used to let it out. showers, anyone?) to travel up the pipe upwards. hoppers will still work so as to not break existing redstone machines, but pipes will allow things to be more compact and (as with the pump and drain suggestion) could make things possible that just can't be done yet. droppers will also directly dispense into pipes like hoppers. this last one goes with the pipe idea, a filter pipe. filters are not impossible in minecraft right now, but they are really hard to do, clicking on a filter pipe will allow you to set a list of all items that can go through, and will have buttons that allow you to allow all types of that item, i.e all planks, both types of sand. as long as if they are put in a crafting recipe they work the same way. this pipe would also not allow fluids to flow through it, as fluids are impossible to put in the whitelist, unless they are inside of a bucket. one last suggestion is if a cow stands on a pump milk will go through the pipe and if there is a chest with buckets in it connected to that pipe with milk it will fill up the buckets, this would also work with other fluids and other buckets.</p>",

They rarely generate in every biome, but each biome can only generate one particular colour! Crystals are sparkling in the dark. The crystals could be a crafting material for a new type of Item: Magic rings! You can place these rings in a new equipment slot (maybe you can wear two at a time in two slots). The rings can get you effects like doing more damage, getting more resistance (fire, fall damage, explosion etc.), greater distance with sword and shootable/throwable objects (arrows, snowballs, trident) faster swimming/running/mining speed, getting 10% more experience, the player will emit a light, bigger inventory and such effects.</p>\n<p>-Echoes and cave ambiance is kind of missing. No, not the cave sounds, more like a permanent thing, when you are deep enough and there is no sunlight.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-Cave exclusive mobs! There need to be some more than cave spiders and silverfishes in my opinion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-A Dungeon like structure (not the Minecraft dungeon, more like RPG dungeons) with traps, new monsters, a maze-like construction, chests and attacking mimic chests. There could be different obstacles to challenge you to pass. similar like the water temple, you can't destroy blocks, but you also can't place any! At the end there is a bossmonster waiting for you. after defeating it, you will be able to destroy the blocks and place blocks in the area of the dungeon. I would call it \"big dungeon\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;-There is a mooshroom. Now how about a gray \"cave pig\". You can feed it the \"cave truffel\" that only generates in caves. The truffel takes really long to reproduce (like the other mushrooms, but there is no big variant of that mushroom) so it takes longer to breed the cave pigs. It drops iron and gold nuggets and rarely an iron ingot, gold ingot, emerald, diamond, redstone, lapis lazuli or coal. They get 3x more damage from picaxes. The cave pigs can only be found in a rare type of cave (truffel cave).</p>",

You have, lets say, three objectives, and completing one gives you a new one. Based on the number you complete, you get more rolls for effects. (Rolls being tries, like if certain potion effects had a 20% chance of occurring, rolling twice would check for that 20% two times).</p>\n<p>I've always wanted an update like this, it'd be really fun :)</p>",

The animation will come to an end when you reach the star at the end of the field (i.e. the Minecraft sun), and then you will wake up.</p>\n<p>When you sleep with preparation (potion effect X, or carrying X item in your hotbar, wearing X, etc), the zooming effect will begin as normal, but partway through you will veer off to an unremarkable star to the side and arrive there instead. When you wake up, you are in the new dimension.</p>\n<p>Multiplayer functionality: If a player has prepared (potion effect, item, block X), and they go to sleep on a multi-player server, instead of waiting for other players to sleep, they should just start the sleep animation, and go to the other world since the time of day does not need to change. if they have not \"prepared\", they will have to wait for other players. Once everyone is in bed (without \"preparation\"), they will all get the sleep animation, and then wake up as normal in the morning.</p>\n<p>I think this dimension should be real, and not part of the player's imagination or dreams (living IRL is the dream in Minecraft!), so the dimension this could lead to could be any of the great ideas posted in this section!</p>\n<p>Some examples that this entrace would suit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360011221631--Dimension-Sky-lands-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360011221631--Dimension-Sky-lands-</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360011645452-The-Spirit-World\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360011645452-The-Spirit-World</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360014048292-The-Autrom-Dimension-a-Golem-Dimension-and-some-opening-tips-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360014048292-The-Autrom-Dimension-a-Golem-Dimension-and-some-opening-tips-</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I think there are better ways to leave, rather than have a limited time in the dream. If you died you'd \"wake up\" and go back, or you could go to sleep while in the dream to go back. These are actual real tricks to waking up in a dream that can often work. (It's not reccomended to try option one if you plan on keeping any items from the dream)</p>\n<p>As for mobs, structures, etc, let's just see what else the devs and community can come up with for the dreams!</p>\n<p>For those who think it would be better to have separate inventories between the real world and dreams, an ender chest is a good method of transporting items back and forth. There would just have to be loot somewhere that would allow the creation of them.</p>",

I also think that it would be a good idea if this Dream Dimension was not only accessible through Sleep but also maybe accessible through a potion. Probably some potion thats reminiscent of a suspicious stew. It’ll be a very very interesting potion due to the fact that it can send you to a Dream Dimension that can give you both either negative or positive potion effects depending on the ores you mine in the Dream Dimension. It’ll make it a kind of randomized potion but also based on the players resources. Also it would probably be a good idea if some of these Dream fantasy biomes were limited in the kind of potion effects it could give a player from its resources. And it might be fun seeing some kind of Nightmare fantasy Biome. I think the experience to join the Dream Dimention through sleep should be a rare occurrence, but when it does happen its also a choice buy clicking a button to send you to the Dream Dimension because I don’t think many players will want to constantly bother with when they are just trying to pass the night.</p>",

Also, I think that the dream dimension should be unpredictable and mystical. Maybe sometimes you could get random nausea, night vision, or speed/slowness. Also, maybe in a rare occurrence, you will spawn with an elytra (just like when you have a flying dream IRL), but when you wake up you do not keep it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I also think that every time you go into the dimension, it should be different. Maybe different colored beds could change the biome or gameplay in the dimension. And I do not agree with gathering enough dream resources to have abilities when you wake up.

Since I've been thinking about this all night, here are a few things I would like to see if Mojang decided to add this as the fourth dimension:</p>\n<p>1. More phantom lore. The phantoms exist. Why? Why on this sweet earth do phantoms exist? Anyways, they exist, and there isn't really an in-game explanation. Their spawning is related to your sleep, so they obviously have a connection to this new dream dimension.</p>\n<p>2. Chaotic disjointed structures, mashed together into a strange dream world. You think you're in a stronghold, but you turn left, and it's a woodland mansion, you turn right and it's an abandoned mineshaft, you walk down a village path into an ocean monument, and come out on top of a pillager outpost. Everything is mashed together.</p>\n<p>3. Dimension populated by Steve's nightmares. What are Steve's nightmares? That's for Jeb to decide. I know he's coming up with some sort of story behind this game, and I want more clues as to what it is.</p>\n<p>4. A community contest to come up with bizarre disjointed biomes to fill this dream world. I know people will come up with great stuff.</p>\n<p>5. Because the dream dimension isn't exactly a new place like the nether or end, but a realm inside the minds of the players, I think instead of a portal, you should build a magical altar around a bed. When using the bed, you can enter the dream dimension by going inside your characters mind.</p>\n<p>So those are my ideas. Thanks!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I agree with most of that, but I think that instead of different dimensions, you just wake up on a bunch of islands in the sky, except there's nothing below them--if you fall, you die.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There's a small chance to have a dream every time you sleep but the Dream Potion guarantees it. It can be three minutes long or eight minutes long. Once you drink the potion and go to sleep, it fades to black like usual, but you wake up in the dream dimension. Every additional dream potion you drink during the dream extends it by three or eight minutes, and the effect countdown shows how much longer the dream lasts. Usually, it's daytime and the islands are peaceful, but there's a one-third chance for it to be a nightmare, where it's night and monsters spawn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In both kinds of dreams, you wake up with no equipment and when you leave the dream you keep any materials you gathered during the dream. Chests of equipment and materials are scattered throughout the dimension, and ores are much more common.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In normal dreams, it's just a race to collect as much as possible in the time you have, and it also breaks up the late game monotony because you don't have any gear. It might be cool for there to be cloud creatures, maybe about the size of a phantom but passive.</p>\n<p>In nightmares, monsters and phantoms are everywhere but there is more loot, and the ultimate objective is to kill the boss, which isn't super powerful but keeps you in the dream until it dies.</p>",

Maybe they could drop a totem of dreams that you could use a certain amount of times to enter \"Dreamland\" sort of like having a durability bar. You just hop into a bed with the totem in your hands, and poof! You are in Dreamland. If you want to wake up, you just make a bed and sleep in it in the dream and you wake up with the items you collected in your dream / nightmare. Once you are in the dreamland, everything is either in really saturated colors or kind of grayed out depending on if you are in a dream or a nightmare. This would be an easy was for people to see which one they are in, and prepare. The nightmare mobs should come in waves, and not right away. The chances of having a nightmare are equal to the ones of having a dream. Again, this is a really cool idea!</p>",

As other suggestions have said, it'd be much better if you had to craft a special bed/item to go to the dream world, as it'd be annoying going to it every time you sleep. Getting killed in the dream world should wake you up, but you won't lose any items. There should be an item called the 'dreamcatcher' or something like that, like somebody else suggested. With this, you'd be able to keep the items and materials you find in the dream, normally being unable to. In Multiplayer, this item should also allow other players to 'enter' your dream, however if they die in the dream, they actually die and lose their items. Phantoms should be very prevalent in the dream world as they ARE based around insomnia/sleeping. Overall, this would add a whole new dimension(no pun intended) to sleeping, while otherwise just being there to avoid the night.</p>",

That would give players something to do while waiting for other players to sleep too. It could be activated the same way as the Open Chat and Leave Bed options, a Dream button. That way you can skip the night if you want to, or play a little game until the sun comes up. Explore a dream biome in a 2D platformer and collect XP instead of ores, so its less OP.</p>",

The floor is bedrock and the trees are just obsidian pillars. Occasionally finding a bush that provides a stick, a chest not so full of moss, a lonely redstone contraption, and a diamond block you'll never have the stone or iron to obtain.

Then, you would have to enchant it (Again, with a mystery enchantment that came up only in the enchanting language) And hang it up over your bed!

I would suggest that when you go to sleep three buttons appear on the screen; one that says \"Leave Bed\" to leave the bed and wake up during the night, one that says \"Sleep through the night\" to sleep normally, and one that says \"Start Dreaming\" or \"Sleep Deeper\" which takes you into the Dream Dimension. This would require that just waiting for the next day wakes you up normally and doesn't take you to the new dimension, players who do go in must be able to leave at any time in a logical and clear way, again, to not confuse anyone who goes in by mistake, and making the sleeping animation longer to allow players more time to choose. I also see a possible issue with parity as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A phone screen would be too small for more than one button without making it confusing.</li>\n<li>An exponential mob spawning system breaks the current system with bedrock having more mobs to accomodate the different combat system, too few mobs would be too easy, too many too overwhelming.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>",

I think mechanically it would be really interesting to execute this by implementing an erosion value to water. when bodies of water are first generated(and not afterwards as to not ruin builds or anything like that), they could destroy blocks that they are flowing into, potentially more depending on the fall height or something like that. this could solve the waterfall thing by creating a divot in the mountain they are on in order to create a path for it to flow down</p>",

Na verdade, acho que todo o bioma de Jungles deve ter uma geração diferente, algo mais parecido com florestas tropicais tipo em filmes do que apenas uma geração elaborada sem pé nem cabeça, e acho que as caixeiras definitivamente devem ser uma dessas gerações. Talvez eu fale sobre isso mais tarde no meu perfil, mas publiquei uma ideia também bem interessante que envolve uma selva e um novo bioma, ajude lá se vocês querem que esse bioma chegue no Minecraft, se chama Karst Peaks</span></span></p>",

Possibly, the frame blocks are made from crafting 8 coral blocks and a Nautilus shell together, and you need to right click the frame with a heart of the sea to light it (the item, I think, shouldn't be consumed).</p>\n<p>I didn't really think that much about Guardians when I was writing this idea, and I think that maybe if a Guardian does shoot at you, maybe you could absorb the energy and then release it later as faster swimming and thorns (This effect would be temporary, and it would lengthen in the amount of time it's active in respect to how many Guardians have shot at you, not how many time's you have been shot). The pearl armor would have this same ability, but the energy stored per Guardian shooting at you is multiplied by 1.5x and the effects given from releasing the energy would be 2x more effective. The pearl armor and tools would be about 2x more durable than their diamond counterparts.</p>\n<p>Soon, I will be adding the ideas from the comments and adding them into the main article. Credit to you guys will be inside the article. Thanks! :D</p>",

I like the idea if it duplicating after it is killed, but how many levels of duplication does it have? Also, if they attack like Zombie Pigman, how many SlimeFish spawn in one pack? These are minor, but essential to have a better mob. This mob is an outstanding idea and needs to be added. Whether in the Abyss Dimension or whether it just spawns regularly in the oceans of the overworld.</p>\n<p>Aquatic Labyrinth- This maze type structure is a weird, but amazing idea. Only question is; does the labyrinth have some type of roof? If not, the eels could just swim right out!</p>\n<p>Pearls/Pearl Dust- An alternative to Redstone would be great, but how does Pearl Dust act as Redstone? Anyway, I'm glad you gave the Pearl item another use besides Pearl Dust because if the only item you could make out of Pearl's was Pearl Dust, no one would bother to get Pearl's because redstone is way easier to get. Adding pearl armour and tools makes the player want/crave the Pearl's, just like how players want all the diamonds, they will want all the Pearl's too.</p>\n<p>I had more thoughts on this, but these are the essentials I wanted to cover. This dimension would be a perfect addition to the game. It's really creative, but not too creative to the point that it seems ridiculous and unnecessary. You did a good job at this, and I want to hear more of your amazing ideas:)</p>",

Would it seek out the nearest large enough source of water, and you’d have to do some portal linking? Would it generate water around it?\n<br />I have two possible solutions:\n<br />1. The Abyss would only generate where there is a sufficient amount of water in the overworld, and cannot be moved through outside of that area\n<br />2. Portals can only be built when there is sufficient space in the overworld (5x5x2 submerged, maybe a small margin of error would be accepted?). In the Abyss, it would replace whatever blocks needed with the portal/water blocks.\n<br />I apologize again if you already brought this up, and I fully support this idea! I just thought it needed to be addressed since I didn’t see it.</p>",

I like the idea of a more powerful armor than diamond, but it should be almost not worth the trouble to procure. It should be D*** near impossible to get it. But if you agree with me, than would you mind changing pearls to another material because I always thought of pearls as brittle and fragile. I would be okay with pearls being implemented as the material with redstone qualities, but not for the armor.&nbsp;</p>",

Like for example the hurricanes showing up near or in ocean biomes, and volcano should be it's own biome entirely.

So it doesn't burn down your entire forest and crash your game. \n<br />A tsunami would be really hard to implement with the way Minecraft's water physics work, but it might be cool if water gets much harder to swim or boat through when it's stormy.\n<br />tornadoes could potentially work if it only could affect certain blocks like break crops, turn grass to dirt blocks, and open doors and gates.

Once u have the weather machine you wouldn't just have the freedom to cause a Natural Disaster. You would have to use ore or rare items to get the weather machine working. Depending on the ore or item will determine what Natural Disaster will take place. And depending on the quantity ore or item will allow you to have a strong version and longer duration on that specific Natural Disaster. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weather Machine would be like a different version of a beacon in a way. &nbsp;Instead of giving potions effects it would give you weather effects. You would have 4-6 options to pick from that would be blizzards, tornados, earthquakes, heavy storms hail/floods, and Firestorms/Volcanos.</p>\n<p>I want these effects to take similar like the raid effect as well. You might have to travel if u want a specific natural disaster to take place. Once u step in a certain biome the natural disaster effect will take place. For example, if u enter a snowy biome or cold one a blizzard would take a place. Or if you enter a plain biome a Tornado will be take place.</p>\n<p>I think adding a trophy item for each natural disaster. Would make a player want to cause a disaster not just for fun and dare of it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

You drop the lava bucket on the crying obsidian and your portal will be lit. The portal color is going to be black.\n<br />After your in the depths youll notice there is ancient debris in the ceiling as well as some purple vines. There would be a new mob called the nether rabbit. The nether rabbit is hostile on sight and drops 1 of each ore upon death. Exploring further into the depths you will find ruins that contain chests and has a menacing giant in front of it made entirely of ancient debris. This giant has 1000 health but it will be worth it if you kill him. He drops 3 nether stars, 60 ancient debris, and he drops a stack of each ore. Poroceed futrher to find a village that is made out of obsidian and a rare new plant called superwheat. Superwheat drops 10 bread per growth stage. Don't think about trying to steal the supetwheat though. The villagers reincarnated and made of gold have very good attack speed and they have the same health as durability on a golden tool. It does 2 hearts of damage without armor on. If you are able to kill all of the villagers you can have all the superwheat to yourself. You can also trade with them give them simple items like something from the such as dirt or sand and you could get your hands on some ancient debris. Nice!\n<br /> </p>\n\n<p>.</p>",

The dead tree would be a new type of tree that generates in the biome. Ideally it would be renewable somehow. The wood itself would be a silvery greyish color. The bark would have a kind of shabby, mottled, dilapidated look (making it useful in builds wherea tree or forests look damaged or dying). The result would be a single set of a new wood type, keeping things simple. Water in this biome could have a sickly looking color. Cobwebs could be found generating on occasion. I think because its dry it can be classified as a hot biome, and would compliment deserts and especially mesas, and could even include fossils. There is plenty of room for new flora and mobs that are idiosyncratic to Minecraft here, as well as a structure. The game could certainly use unique biomes that are evil/creepy looking in the Overworld. Would make for a great halloween theme, or another home for witches or a new mob. In the future, if they add 3D biomes, the caves underneath would have some interesting options. Overall a great idea.</p>",

I may include some ideas alredy said, but this is what I was thinking.<br>- Snow should accumulate under trees. This would work by alowing snow to accumulate under leaves, but &nbsp;accumulation would be 10% less likely per a tick for every leaf block above the area of accumulation. This would ignore snow that has accumulated on top of leaves above it. Nobody likes seeing bare patches under trees, its a real eye sore.<br>- Snow can accumulate on top of stairs and slabs. Upside down stairs and top slabs would accumulate just like normal blocks. Regular stairs and down slabs would become \"snowlogged, and accumulate snow inside of their empty space and the regular stairs would accumulate part of a snow layer on top of them in the corresponding shape. Collecting the snow layer would remove the snow from both inside the stain and on top of it.<br>-Snow can accumulate inside of other non full blocks such as fences, glass pains, walls, doors, open trapdoors, tall plants, etc.</p>\n<p>-Snow can accumulate under overhangs, but much slower, and the sky would have to be visible above a certain angle of elevation. The lower the angle of elevation to the nearest visible sky, the less likely it is for snow to accumulate. Maybe the lowest angle of elevation for snow to accumulate at would be 45°.<br>-Make grass blocks with no snow on top gradually turn white just like leaves, and make is so they won't start accumulating snow until they have turned white. Grass that does have accumulation will stay white as normal.<br>-Snow on a block that has a vertical side exposed can only accumulate 2 layers of snow, but blocks that are adjacent to a block that has a block on top of it can accumulate up to 6 layers of snow. Blocks that meet both criteria can accumulate up to 4 layers a usual. This will help create the smoother slopes that are characteristic of real snowfall. <br>All of these changes will allow for a much smoother snow cover.</p>",

Sea Lanterns and Shroomlights, as well as soulfire lights, should be sufficient for cold biomes, and requires only a change to their values. A lot of this is a parity issue as some of these are present in Bedrock, so simply bringing snow biomes to parity with Bedrock would solve most of this. Even just having snow texture grass and leaves would help. I dont think snowlogging stairs and slabs will ever be viable though (warm homes melt snow on roofs anyway). What is truly needed is the ability for snow to grow around fences, walls and plants. This will result in builds looking \"snowed in\" and would be incredible due to the incremental nature of snow layers. I really dont like the idea of things dying or withering due to temperature though, as this will severely limit terraforming options and add needlessly complex mechanics. Overall this is sorely needed for immersion and aesthetics and I hope we will see this someday.</p>",

I find very few rivers, if any, to be little more than a creek.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) Get rid of that annoying tapering. A lot of rivers, especially inland and away from oceans, simply aren't rivers but long lakes. A \"dry riverbed\" is cool, but at the moment that's not a feature, its just a side effect of poor generation</p>\n<p>3) Biome diversification. There are many types of rivers in real life, there should be some for Minecraft also. Deltas, Rapids, Deep Canyon Rivers, Waterfalls, etc etc.</p>\n<p>4) Structures. Bridges, dams, sunken riverboats like gondolas or barges. a canal that can connect rivers.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall rivers are very... mediocre. They tend not to get noticed.<br><br>Related to this, I'd request a new build-your-own-ship game mechanic, much like Archimedes ship mod. I understand its a very niche request but I don't see why not.</p>\n<p>Lastly, an idea I've had for a while ever since the first \"Fix the oceans\" update (Elder Guardians and Ocean Monuments). But I've noticed that Minecraft has taken a very ecological stance with many of their new mobs and gameplay. What about a pollution mechanic. Throwing \"litter\" (any discarded items) into the water (or ground) can create areas that are dead zones more or less. Fish swim along and choke and die on the items dropped. Could be for in the water just as much as on land.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyway thanks for reading this paragraph (or two)</p>",

But I definitely agree, current rivers aren't really much different than a narrow, shallower ocean. Often, the only way I know I'm in a river is that there's no kelp around. I feel like having it actually flow downhill might be a bit difficult for them to figure out how to randomly generate, but if they at least added some rules for where they originate and end, then that would massively improve their aesthetic and 'realisticness'. I've seen some rivers where they just cut across a small section of land, connecting two bits of ocean together, which is not very realistic at all. Now that they added all these new mountain biomes, particularly the icy and snowy ones, I feel like there's some real opportunity for them to improve river generation</p>",

They don't even necessarily come from mountains. They create when a large area of terrain is sloping : rain water usually fills the dirt like a sponge, and trickles down from it.

But why would players want to travel here? Well, why do they want to travel anywhere? One reason is the scenery.</p>\n<p>This biome is so awe-inspiring that any who stumble upon it when mining probably won't want to leave. The trees are giant with beautiful leaves weeping down from the branches. On the trunks of the trees you can find Foxfire Fungi - clusters of small green glowing mushrooms. The floor of the biome is made up of Alien Soil. On the floor of the forest, Ghost Mushrooms can be found. Hanging from the ceiling of the cave are glow worm threads.</p>\n<p>Another reason to go here is to gather the various items of the peculiar forest. Foxfire fungi, obtainable with silk touch, can be used in brewing to make a potion of emitting light. Ghost Mushrooms can glow pink, orange, teal, or green and are good decorations for lighting. Fissured Concrete, crafted from bioluminescence, has cracks that emit light and can serve as a good path. Silk from cocoons can be used to craft parachutes.</p>\n<p>Even without mobs, this forest sounds amazing, right? To make things better, here are some of my ideas for mobs of the forest:</p>\n<p>Crystal Fox</p>\n<p>Butterflies and Caterpillars</p>\n<p>Fireflies</p>\n<p>Jellyfish</p>\n<p>Bright Tree Villagers</p>\n<p>Tree Golem</p>",

Like a blue forest, a golden-yellow one, a blue one, an aqua one and so on.</p>\n<p>I would also like the idea of the plants being so special that if you try to mine them, all you get is 'dead foliage' or something to avoid the issue of having to add 1000 different coloured leaves. The forest is only alive and beautiful if it's left intact - that would give it a magical aura too.</p>\n<p>Maybe there would be a new light source to be found, something like 'glow balls' (imagine floating light bulbs) and they're the seeds of glow flowers (which would die if you pluck them) but the glow balls can be collected and used in builds.</p>\n<p>Also the trees ('chromatic birch') would have a new wood type. For example an olive colour (since we do not have one yet), kinda on the birchy side but more olive so it's usable too. Or a grey wood colour ('weathered chromatic birch'). This happens if the wood is 'treated' with a specific lacquer that is specially crafted. The chromatic birch leaves would be randomly coloured, hence the name, and essentially non-harvestable - you can basically only get 'dead foliage' (like with corals). The chromatic birch seeds can be harvested and planted wherever, though.</p>",
