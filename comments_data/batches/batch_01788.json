It would solve the frustrations many have when listening to newer / older soundtracks by allowing them to customise their game experience more easily. It allows for more music to be added to the game by the developers very easily too allowing for more wiggle room for error (If there is a large dislike to a soundtrack, rather than developers needing to remove it, players can simply turn off that specific soundtrack).</p>\n<p>This feature should increase player happiness too which should prevent players from permanently muting the game's soundtrack. I have noticed many players muting all of their music due to their frustrations with music they do not enjoy hearing, this then causes them to become unhappy because they cannot hear the music they want to hear but cannot do so without hearing music they do not want to, implementing this feature should stop this from happening.</p>\n<p>This is a great idea which does not affect the balance or stability of the gameplay be it in survival or creative while also increasing enjoyment of the game, this will keep the Minecraft community more happy if implemented and has no negative side effects.</p>",
