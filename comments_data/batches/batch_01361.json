When playing \"Spleef,\" for example, players could slide around on the ice like a penguin. it made “<strong><em>Penguin Wars</em></strong>” an enjoyable memory, now lost to time. water slides and waterparks were also an enjoyable point in Minecraft history now lost to time.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition, if a player was caught by the the water flow streams of a&nbsp;<strong>mob grinder</strong>, or another form of trap, all they had to do was sprint forward, and they could swim them themselves out of&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>mob grinder</strong>&nbsp;contraption, into a one block gap that did or didn't contained water in it, to safety. [You mentioned these articles: (<a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-101928\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong><em>MCPE-101928</em></strong></a>).] This allowed players to create escape holes, similar to and in conjunction with various redstone productions in Minecraft.</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The previous comments are about a feature of Minecraft, that/while removed, at the time made sense from a commercial and community standpoint. It stands to reason that the more invested players are in the community, the more crazy interactions with the game that they (players) talk about, the more people with buy the game and addons, both. The article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-46796\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong><em>One Block Swimming</em></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-38751\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Swimming can be activated in shallow water (MCPE-38751)</em></a>, and the article:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MCPE-47261\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong><em>Swim Problem (MCPE-47261)</em></strong></a>&nbsp;are focusing on the negative sides of things on this feature. However, it looked cool, made Minecraft more fun, and enough people knew about it that it became more of a feature rather than a problem. Please bring it back, one form or another.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
