However, I take your point about reducing the damage, which I think makes sense, so I would propose throwing deals 2HP (1 heart) less damage than wielding. On the stacking, once a cooldown is introduced there is no real difference between them and a bow, so I personally don't feel that 16 in unreasonable. However, I do agree that people shouldn't just be able to spam them, so if the cooldown isn't enough to prevent this then maye reducing the stack size is worthwhile.</p>",

Partially.</p>\n<p>If I'm honest part of the cost is just because I wanted to make the crafting recipe vaguely resemble what I had in mind. But yes, I was aware at the time and factored that in. I actually had two thoughts on that myself.</p>\n<p>1) Multiple twinblades. The crafting recipe could actually make 4 twinblades instead of 1, so therefore they would actually be individually cheaper than swords.</p>\n<p>2) Their relative power. Whilst they do -1/-2 damage compared to a sword, the fact that they can be thrown makes them more versatile. I also intended them to have a different function to the sword, which is represented by their 'slicing' ability to ignore armour (which would prove interesting when introduced to a PvP server/minigame) and their unique enchantments, in particular 'grounding', making them the first real weapon aimed at flying mobs.</p>\n<p>Effectively I envision the twinblade as an alternative to arrows. For me at least, making arrows is an excessively exhausting process, requiring me to kill a chicken and dig through lots of gravel. So to have an alternative would be appealing, despite the relative expense of a weapon. In addition, the stackability and faster-than-arrow cooldown make them a potentially lethal ranged weapon.</p>",

Or at least offer more fish species in the game (both fresh and salt) to give more variety. Perhaps add a function to gravel so when you use the crafting table you can dye the gravel, add glow ink if you want flourescent gravel, to make an aquarium substrate. Or maybe the Totem of Undying could be put into a fishtank (since some of the totems look like cute fishtank decorations).</p>\n\n<p>Why do you want something done?</p>\n\n<p>Minecraft is a limitless game. Not only can we take great adventures in the game, but we can also make homes that some ofus cannot have in the real world. Getting to even have an aquarium is not an option for some of us.</p>\n\n<p>How do you want something done?</p>\n\n<p>As was aforementioned, having another crafting option for gravel would be great, perhaps an aquarium block type, and maybe even some more fish species (both fresh and salt).</p>",

They could have a dark purple or blue texture to contrast the brown and red mushrooms already in game avoiding green since the pickles already are greeen. Orange and yellow could look too close to the current brown or red mushrooms or netherwart.  The mushrooms could stack up to 4 in a single block space, like turtle eggs and pickles.</p>",
