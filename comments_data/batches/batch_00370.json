Of invisibility would instead of giving everyone inside it the effect of invisibility it would make everyone on the outside not be able to see what's inside of the effect but everyone on the inside of the effect be able to see everything on the inside and outside which could allow for some pretty cool things I think how this could work is their vision would be like if everything inside of it was made of air they would just see everything on the opposite side of it and on their side of it.
