I come with an idea for Minecraft, which would be a new dimension called \"The Beginning\" This new dimension would be very similar to the end, and if, if I'm talking about the sky, in this dimension would be found all kinds of animals that would run out as you approached and there would be a big, majestic red dragon that would be flying all over the place, it would be harmless unless you stole their treasure that would be hidden in a mountain , by defeating him this would become harmless and we could assemble it and try to tame it by giving it cod. This would serve to give Minecraft a little more lore, and you could see in achievements: When going to this dimension there would be an achievement that would say \"The Home? And by defeating the dragon we would get the achievement \"The Beginning of the End\" by implying that this would have bad consequences.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;\">- Translated by&nbsp;Admin</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

This may be the solution there. Also a good idea is to have a mountainous version of the steppe called the Buttes biome. So much can be done with this.</p>",

There could be small waterfalls streaming down the sides, and a rare chance for glaciers to generate at the beginning point of the fjord. If it’s possible, the can be a rare snowy variant of the biome, with a frozen over river. If the fjord opens up to an ocean, there could be a chance for a village to generate there. As for structures, there could be stone tower ruins, and possibly Viking style villages and/or taiga villages, and for mobs, seagulls would make a great addition.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I like this idea very much, however I think that instead of a secret recipe the boss will drop a rare ingredient that is required to make the potions in the idea, and can only be obtained by defeating this boss. Maybe instead of having one giant mad scientist villager, there will be one in every giant laboratory. Also I think that this dimension should have several biomes, maybe redstone valley filled with redstone contraptions, distortion forests filled a new kind of trees with _jeb sheep but maybe without the name tag and maybe other weird looking mobs like cowlins (like the piglin only as a cow instead of a pig) and sheeplins. There should be more biomes but I can’t think of more good ideas now. Also, I think this biome should be harder to get to, maybe by placing 2 colors of wool on the floor in a 5*5 checker pattern, placing a dragon egg in the middle and then with flint and steal light fire on each corner and you have to use the flint and steal fast enough so that the wool won’t have time to burn. Once you go through the portal, you get back you dragon egg. Because this dimension will give the player so many useful things I don’t think it should be available at the early stages of the game. Maybe requiring the player to use a dragon egg is too difficult and instead a wither skull should be used or another way to require the player to go to the nether, maybe warped wood. Maybe the portal will be made using a checker board of crimson and warped planks.</p>",
