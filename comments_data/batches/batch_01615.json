With a bow under water we’ll that’s useless. So how would you be able to beat it? I mean a trident would work. Though you would go through so many tridents that it would not be fun. So I came up with a vary similar idea but not as hard!</p>\n\n<p>Well you know those under water temples? Well have one huge one and have guardians surrounding the thing. Though in the middle there’s a portal. That portal will lead you to like the end only it’s the water kingdom or something. Then have it so you are on like a platform. Then have this long snake like Leviathan that bolts into you and you have to jump out of the way. It has 500 health even. Then after 4 bolts it uses a tornado like thing and you have to run from that. Then it shoots like a Crystal thing and you have to deflect it like a Gast fire ball and then it floats down and you have 4 seconds to Attack it with your weapons and then it repeats the attacks until it gets down to 200 health then it follows you and try’s to suck you in witch then you have to use tnt and light the tnt and it sucks it in and you have to do that 5 times to make it so you can attack it!</p>\n\n<p>That’s my idea!

The loot thing, although cobblestone, roads and land, it would be logical and with more sense, the players need something that is new and more a new mob that is strong should release something that is not yet in the game, For example, my idea to complement yours is to give a 4-leaf clover that allows us to create the effect of a potion of luck. An effect that cannot be obtained in survivability and that would give the game an air if it were added in that way. too. I think the percentage of that item is very low so you get excited when you get one and not break the game if that was exaggerated. Thank you</p>",
