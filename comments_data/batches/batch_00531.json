Anyways, I like the idea of upgrading the bundles but I'd rather see a storage upgrade (maybe netherite bundles hold 2 stacks) over the ability to withstand lava. After all, you run into a similar problem that the players in late-game (the players with netherite and shulkers) will most likely be carrying 9+ bundles, re-introducing the problem of making lava deaths like any other death, just to a smaller degree, as 1/4 of their inventory will be protected, and you may even be able to put shulkers into bundles regardless.</p>",

Since this is the End's Netherite, you should either have to upgrade your Netherite gear to Purpurine gear, making it a tier above Netherite, or you should have to upgrade to it from diamond gear, making Purpurine a mutually exclusive counterpart to Netherite. If this were the case, you would have to choose between the fire resistance from Netherite or the benefits of the new armor type (maybe protection from fall damage or End mobs). Either way, the progression should make use of the Smithing Table. Maybe we would have to find Purpurine Upgrade Templates in End Ships or something.</p>",

I wanted to use the plain ones as decoration around my house, but the string method was way too awkward looking, and I'm kind of a perfectionist. I thought it could be crafted from a common drop from wither skeletons, possibly from \"withered bones\" instead of regular bones, to make \"withered bonemeal.\" Or maybe you could combine bonemeal and coal in the crafting menu to get the \"charred bonemeal\" as you suggested. It would be especially useful on saplings, sugar cane, and cacti, because those are the items that the string really stands out on. After a plant is stunted with this item, the only way to revert it to its natural state could be to either \"regular\" bonemeal it, or break it and place it back down. A stunted plant would have no visible differences between itself and its un-stunted counterparts because that would mostly defeat the purpose; but rather, it would be recognizable by the fact that it hasn't grown. Alternatively, the \"anti-bonemeal\" could be somehow related to the new powdered snow, as some form of that item could be used to craft a freezing device of sorts that stunts plant growth that way. Either way, it's a great idea and I'd love to see it eventually added to the game!</p>",

Because the end is rather lacking in exciting resources, perhaps a new ore, called \"Enderite\" could be found rarely by mining in end islands. In addition, there could be lapis lazuli end ores and potentially others. This would add another exciting reason to go to the end, and a good mining challenge because while ancient debris is rare, the low blast resistance of netherack makes obtaining it fairly easy, since beds produce such large explosions. Being that endstone is quite blast resistant, this would make it hard to mine for it. The end islands also provide logistical challenges for mining, because you have to be careful to not fall in the void, and the end islands are fairly small, so you will have to go from one to another. \"Enderite\" could be a deep blue-violet and would look very pretty.</p>",
