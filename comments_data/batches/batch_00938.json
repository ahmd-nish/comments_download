A subtropical desert will be hot and dry year round, while a temperate desert will be cold in the winter and hot in the summer. I’m guessing Minecraft’s desert is a temperate desert given the cacti and the dead bushes. The desert is not flooded with rain in spring and autumn. In fact, Minecraft’s whole temperature system is a bit flawed and will need to be changed if sasons were to be implemented.</p>",

I would advocate for leaf textures simply turning white, as if the snow was coating any remaining leaves. I think, along with snow on the ground, biomes would truly become a winter wonderland of sorts. Also, the only biomes to not see snow should be: deserts, jungles, savannahs, and mesa biomes. The rest should all see snow! Swamps should perhaps not see snow, but maybe experience occasional ice, with the water and ponds freezing up?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ideas for the other seasons I have seen sound spectacular, especially autumn.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As seasons has become more and more relevant in the Minecraft community, many people have expressed their interest in this idea. Seasons youtube videos have garnered thousands of likes with many people expressing their love of this idea. I hope Mojang listens!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I sincerely hope Mojang puts seasons into the game in 1.15. I do not believe that seasons should take up an entire update themselves, but should be added to an update that's planned in the future (hopefully 1.15 so we get them soon!)</p>",

        "body": "<p>I think seasons could definitely work if done carefully and correctly, here’s how I’d do it. Each season would have a smooth transition for the changing textures of the grass and the leaves, each seasonal phase lasting about 200 minutes or 10 minecraft days. Player placed leaves would not change, however saplings planted by the player (once grown into trees) would change. TL;DR at bottom<br>_________________________________________________________________________<br>**Winter:** Most tree leaves (except spruce ones) would take on a branchy texture (dropping only sticks) in most biomes except jungle and hot biomes and grass could appear frosty and have slippy properties in most biomes (except hot ones or jungle) Snowfall could occur in cool biomes, be heavier in snowy ones and eventually melt in spring (snow layers already melt in biomes that arent cold in bedrock edition, however there are no actual seasons so it’s not the most useful feature for now). Crops wouldn’t grow at all without bonemeal, hunger would go down 1.5 times quicker in winter unless you’re next to a heat source, perhaps cooked foods would provide greater saturation in winter than non cooked foods? Husks could also be prevented from spawning in winter and maybe snow golems could spawn in random places too? Water would also freeze over except in hot biomes and jungle.</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________ <br>**Spring:** Currently Minecraft is in eternal spring, the only differences to current minecraft could be blossom on most trees (pink or white) (not jungle and spruce ones, nor ones in deserts.) Creepers could be strongest in spring, their damage dealt increasing by 1 or even 2 hearts. More passive animals would spawn in every biome and crops could grow faster and have a chance of not using up bonemeal when bonemealed.</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________ <br>**Summer:** Creepers (being plants) could burn in daylight (except in cold biomes) and strays would be rarer due to the heat but husks could have a chance of spawning in most biomes except for cold ones. In cold biomes it would rain instead of snow and Steve’s hunger would not go down as quick but getting set on fire would last longer. The leaves on trees could be a vibrant green (alpha minecraft green) and the grass a wheaty colour in most biomes except cold and hot ones. Maybe in hot biomes sudden fires could occur and thunderstorms be more common.</p>\n<p>___________________________________________________________________________ <br>**Autumn:** Rain would be far more common and so would all the monsters seeing as it is the month of Halloween, endermen would rarely spawn however due to it being a wetter month. Crops would start to grow slower (an early sign of winter approaching) harvest season and leaves could break and disappear faster after chopping all the wood on a tree. The grass could gain a brownish muddy top texture and if under certain trees a leafy overlay.</p>\n<p>**TL;DR:** Essentially the only thing really changing each season would be certain mob spawning rates, the colour and/or texture of grass and leaves, the chance and location of downfall (snow/rain) and the rate at which hunger or saturation goes down.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Here's a comment I already wrote under an AntVenom's Video</p>\n<p>\"To throw my ideas in the box:<br>First of all, to give it a little bit of realism, we should seperate between \"seasonable\" and \"unseasonable\" biomes. Areas like the jungle, deserts, mesas, snow plains, oceans an stuff like that are actually consistent in real life. Yes, african jungles, asian deserts and the poles (okay, except the poles) acutally have seasons but they aren't as notable as seasons in countries like the USA, Germany or the UK. Plains, forests, mountains and all the other biomes are \"seasonable\". That means that they change in roughly a three-month-cycle.<br>The compromise of starting with Spring actually is pretty good. Having a lot of flowers spreadingall over the lanf actually would be very pretty and you could farm plants every year without having to worry about the limitations of that resource. Having like cold flowers in snow biomes or cactees blooming would be cool too (yeah, I just denied seasons in these biomes but I'm talking about the big stuff there like snowfall). Spring would also be perfect to fix the (at least in my point of view) ugly grass color of the plains and make it more green. Animals start to come out in Spring and start... \"watching the braking bed\"...<br>Summer would be even more colorful and brighter than spring with having the sun shining. More animals are starting to come out and fill the land. We could even add glaciers in normal mountains/extreme mountains that melt in Summer. Standing in the sun with an iron helmet for too long would be bad of course, so let's add a random, not too often appearing, nausea effect if this happens.<br>In Fall, leaves starting to change their color to more brown- and red-ish tones. The grass around the trees also is full of a podzol-like structure and a leaf particle (like in the better foliage mod) start fallin off. Mushrooms start to grow and witches get more active. Also, the weather is changing and we'll get a lot rains and storms. All kind of animals are preparing - as well as you are - for the winter.<br>Now, we are going into the REAL surviving-aspect (okay, not really). The trees still would have snowy treetops but just because I have no Idea how to let minecraft trees look good without leaves. Winter is very cold so it's hard to let your plants grow and it's almost impssible to find animals for your meals, so you have to prepare in Fall. Lakes are freezing and snow is falling down to leave a layer of snow (to give you the real feeling of winter \"^\". Also, stairs and slabs would need to work with snow). Swimming in icy water gives you a frosting effect, slows your movement and kills you slowly and painfully. Leaving your house without a cozy leather armor let's you shake so it's harder to look around. Having Villagers changin their clothes would actually be really cool. Integrating them to the features of the hard winter could bring warehouses into the villages to store food.<br>While the warm biomes aren't affected that much, cold biomes could get very dangerous. Letting you freeze to death (without swimming in water) and summoning snowstorms (that actually could contain a great boss) makes you either avoid these biomes in winter stepping into them for the right challenge. But igloos still keep you warm. In these cold biomes, snow could actually layer by itself like if you would put snow on top of each other, to create snowy hills and to make it harder to walk.<br>In general, it also would be really cool if there's a chance of having torches getting turned off by the weather. But you could turn them back on with a lighter. To avoid this, you rather should craft lanterns to lighten your way through the heavy blizzards of the snowy plains.<br>Caves - just like in real life - are warm in winter and cold in summer. Actually, they would stay at one specific temperature because there neither is a sun to warm it up, nor coulds to keep the sun away.</p>\n<p>(I'm very sorry for potential grammatical mistakes, my English kinda rosted over time)</p>\n<p>uwu\"</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

What would be the length of the seasonal year?</li>\n<li>Are seasons tied to the moon cycle?</li>\n<li>Would this include modifications to the behaviour of the sun and moon so seasons have a visual indication?</li>\n<li>Would new items be added to aid the tracking of seasons such as a calendar item?</li>\n<li>Would seasons be optional per world?</li>\n<li>Can seasons be controlled by game rules?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Effects on crops and animals</strong></p>\n<p>Seasonal effects have been discussed in depth by others so I'll touch on this lightly.</p>\n<p>I expect a prominent part of seasons would be differences in crop growing speed and the breeding of animals. Animals might breed more easily in spring, such as a shorter breeding cooldown, better chances of multiple births (twin lambs, litters of pigs) or higher chances of chicks from eggs. Breeding cooldown could be longer in winter. Crop plots go dormant in winter: they grow clops slowly and they don't dry out.</p>\n<p><strong>Effect on the player</strong></p>\n<p>I don't expect any detrimental effects on the player, except incidental effects. Example: Blizzards could have reduced visibility (as low as 2 chunks) but the cold won't actually harm the player.</p>\n<p><strong>Weather model</strong></p>\n<p>Overhauling the weather model would be required. Apart from snow/rain depending on the time of the year, other changes would be required. Biome-dependent rain in specific seasons: Jungles could get more rain in wet seasons, deserts could get rain in summer from storms. Savannahs could get wet seasons that turn them green. Overcast weather could be added as a separate weather type instead of just being the manifestation of rain in deserts.</p>\n<p><strong>Length of the year</strong></p>\n<p>This needs some discussion. Some people have put out their ideas for the season length without any explanation and this isn't convincing. Why must seasons have a particular length? 24 hours of gameplay give 72 Minecraft days. How many seasons would pass in that time?</p>\n<p>I think it's a bad idea to have short seasonal year lengths. Eight or 10 days for a season is too short. A player could go mining underground for a few hours and miss multiple seasons before they resurface.</p>\n<p>It is also a very bad idea to tie the seasons to real-world months. Not only does that give a year is that too long (potentially thousands of days), it also fails to consider that not everyone experiences the same seasons at the same time of year. In some parts of the world, October is a <em>spring</em> month. In others, it's in the dry or wet season.</p>\n<p>Finally, all months and seasons should be the same length. Why complicate things needlessly?</p>\n<p>So what would be a reasonable year length? Some possible ideas:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>one Minecraft seasonal month = 1 lunar month (8 days), 12 seasonal months per year. This gives seasons of 24 days and a Minecraft year of 96 days. This is the shortest year length that is plausible.</li>\n<li>one Minecraft seasonal month = 24 days, one season = 72 days, a year = 288 days. This allows players to log on to a server once a day and log in during a different season. (Ignoring beds.)</li>\n<li>One seasonal month = 32 days, a season = 96 days, one year = 384 days. This is the closest approximation to the 365-day year that preserves Minecraft's tendency to use powers of 2 to count things. This is perhaps the longest plausible year length.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of these have seasonal months that are multiples of 8, to match the current lunar cycle. However, the lunar cycle can be changed.</p>\n<p><strong>Sun and Moon</strong></p>\n<p>In the real world, the seasons are driven by the length of the day and the height of the sun. This could be incorporated into Minecraft with the sun taking a tilted path across the sky and the sun having a different altitude in the sky over a year. The Minecraft world could have a \"latitude\" that controls the motion of the sun. The sun could pass to the north or the south, and high world latitudes could allow the midnight sun to occur at midsummer. This would give a visual indication of the seasons by the motion of the sun. Players may have a lot of fun tracking this and building their version of Stonehenge.</p>\n<p>The moon would also need to follow the same path as the sun. Not only does this mean the moon would have a tilted path too, this implies that the moon may need to be altered so it's correctly placed in the sky in relation to the sun at all times. Crescent moons would be near the sun, and only full moons would be opposite the sun.</p>\n<p>The moon cycle need not remain at eight days. It can be altered if desired.</p>\n<p>Would eclipses occur?</p>\n<p><strong>New items</strong></p>\n<p>If seasons are added, it may require the addition of a calendar item. This would be similar to a clock item except for seasons.</p>\n<p>A similar item for tracking the moon phases may be helpful too.</p>\n<p><strong>Game rules</strong></p>\n<p>Seasons should be controlled by a small set of game rules. It should be possible to turn them on or off and configure various parameters.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This can truly make minecraft for all ages knowing since time is at the essence but the seasons are there to know you would freeze to death in real life LOL.

A cool idea for creative role play worlds would be letting the player choose the length of each season. Spring should be very green. At the start of spring all the plants (including trees) should be recovering from winter but towards the end of spring plant life should be flourishing. Some trees in spring should be pink. Summer should make the grass a brighter tint of green than spring and still have plant life but no pink trees. Crops should grow best in spring and summer. Autumn should make all the trees leaves go brown, orange and gold over the course of days. Spruce trees should remain dark green. At the end of autumn there should be not a lot of leaves left on the trees. The grass should be more yellow in autumn. Winter should make farming hard or impossible without bone meal. The grass should be a cold blue/green and some lakes and rivers should freeze. Some animal could hibernate. There should be no leaves left on trees (except spruce trees). Hail stones could be a new weather type and it could snow sometimes as well. (In spring it should rain a lot). The Jungle, Savannah, desert and snowy biomes should not be effected by seasons, crop growth in snowy biomes should be slow. Jungles biomes should make crops grow at the normal speed. Please add seasons to the game.</p>",

For example, the only trees you might find in winter can be spruce trees, and other trees loose their leaves, or their leaves turn white.</p>\n<p>In spring, you can find cherry blossom trees, and double tall grass and flowers, because the weather is suitable for them. Trees start to grow leaves. White leaves change to green (this can be similar to the dirt turning into grass animation)</p>\n<p>In summer, there can be green grass, and small flowers like poppies and dandelions can grow. Also fruit trees.</p>\n<p>In fall, the tree colours change, and there can be particles to imitate falling leaves. It can be like falling snow that piles up under the tree, but with leaves instead.</p>\n<p>Also I think there should be a warmth bar. In winter if you stay out too much your warmth starts to reduce and if it gets to 0, then you start to loose hearts. Just like when underwater.</p>\n<p>In spring summer and fall, it reduces slowly.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A chestplate can imitate a winter jacket,&nbsp; and keep your warmth up for a while.

The spruce will only have its original and the the snowy texture because it still snows in the taiga. But I still think crop effect should happen in all biomes. The snowy ones should be always the way they are. Also villages in these biomes would have some sort of green house (or maybe a glass roof overtop there farms) and villagers should change clothes through the seasons. I still think mobs should be harder to find in winter because most of them go hibernate in the winter. This will give players a challenge teaching them to collect as much food as they can before winter comes. Also when you create a world you spawn in summer.</p>",

For instance, Polar Bears could spawn more commonly when it's winter, and not just in the ice mountains biome. When it's summer, a variant of polar bears (Brown Bears) could spawn in forests, and near lakes. Another idea is that maybe winter could add some more functionality to leather. When it's cold in winter, you could wear a leather coat, or maybe just plain leather armor, to not catch hypothermia. Minecraft could also make it so that you need something like campfires to keep you warm. Overall, this is an extremely good idea, and I look forward to Minecraft implementing Seasons in the game, however they seem fit to do it.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Seasons shouldn't be based purely on boreal climates where snow is common in winter and not common at other times. There should be more variety. This variety can be managed adequately by introducing a few new biomes. Some example biomes:</p>\n<p><strong>Oceanic Forest</strong> - Does not usually snow in winter, storms are more frequent in summer, small temperature range during the year. This biome only occurs next to oceans. (The oceans moderate the temperatures so the summers are cooler and winters are warmer.) Example: New Zealand.</p>\n<p><strong>Cold Desert</strong> - Similar to a normal desert, but has a different vegetation mix and occasional cobblestone outcrops. Cold winters. Strays can spawn in winter instead of skeletons. This desert can be placed next to an icy biome instead of a regular desert, making it somewhat rare. Example: Gobi Desert, Mongolia.</p>\n<p>Existing biomes need consideration as to frequency of snowfall, if any, and which seasons have rain or snow, if any.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<p><strong>Taiga</strong> gets snow in winter. <strong>Cold taiga</strong> gets snow in spring and autumn as well, and the snow melts only in summer. <strong>Savannas</strong> get rain in summer (wet season) and turn green in summer. <strong>Deserts</strong> get rain only in summer and only in storms. <strong>Plains</strong> get less rain than <strong>forests.</strong></p>\n<p>It is clear that if seasons are implemented, the weather model must be changed as well, to permit more variable weather. A possible weather model can use 1D Perlin noise to simulate precipitation, and a simple sine wave for the temperature, adjusted as needed.</p>",

This could introduce more cloud textures for incoming \"fronts\" seen in the distance. The sizes of these systems could vary from just a few clouds to a hurricane, multiple-biome sized storm.</p>\n<p>The rain could also create tiny water sources over a long period of time, much like snow appears in snowy biomes, but would take much longer and would not flow as far. Or blocks could have a puddle texture that makes it look like the rain has accumulated on it after a while.</p>\n<p>Flowing rivers would also be a nice addition that fits well in this update. In winter certain rivers could freeze over, assuming it is in between 2 biomes like a forest and taiga, and not adjacent to a desert. Maybe wider rivers could be introduced because as of now they are typically only a few blocks wide. Even features like deltas and biomes like wetlands could be added!</p>",

Any snow layers out in the open will melt and crops will grow very fast.</p>\n<p>Summer: more rain and husks will occasionally spawn at night. Enemies spawn at a rate of 60% as opposed to default (spring).</p>\n<p>Fall: Less rain and grass appears darker green. Leaves on trees appear brownish as well. Crops will also begin to grow 50% slower than they usually do. Mob spawning is increased by 50% as opposed to default (spring)</p>\n<p>Winter: Snow starts falling and water will become frozen, unless there is a light source near it. Any oceans or rivers that aren't \"warm\" will be completely frozen as well. Crops will stop growing completely and mob spawning is significantly increased. Strays will also be able to spawn at night as well as zombies and will not burn in daylight. Only sheep can spawn in the winter as they have wool on their bodies to keep themselves warm.&nbsp;</p>",

Maybe with tundra biomes and mountains snow piles could only slightly reduce, but in other lush biomes all snow could completely melt away in the spring. Maybe I’m crazy idk lol</p>",

Adding to the tree idea, it would be nice if the leaves looked different throughout the minecraft year. Spring they would have tiny sprigs of leaves, and maybe even some cherry blossoms. In summer they would be the generic ones that we have right now, but maybe see some apples hanging from the trees. During fall they would turn orange, red and yellow, and maybe add a tiny particle that looks like a leaves that could fall from the trees. Finally in winter there we be no leaves, and it would snow everywhere, not just mountains and ice spikes, ect. (Excluding of course beaches and desserts, mesa). Pumpkins maybe could only grow in fall and summer, and melons could be a summer thing too, like watermelon. Also to the side I think it would look very nice if Constellations were added too. Maybe a creeper face, or the enderdragon, that would also change as the year went on. Finally, if the days were longer or shorter depending on the season it would add a nice touch. A version of the clock could be used to determine exactly what part of the year it was. Thanks!</p>",

I my self have always wanted snow and stuff at my base but I usually don't live in any snowy biomes. This would also be amazing for gathering of powdered snow so you can get it in any biome (almost). If this would be added I definitly agree with what you said about the mobs and crops but I also think it should be a little darker in the winter and autumn and shorter days which would also technically mean more mobs. Days in minecraft are currently 10 minutes long and same goes for the nights. What if the autumn had 11 for nights and 8 for days and winter had it be 12 for nights and 8 for days instead? That's just my oppinion and I really hope this gets added to the actual game!</p>",

I love this game, but the world can sometimes feel stale, like I'm truly the only one progressing in the game. It would be nice to see the world change around me with seasons.</p>\n<p>It would also be awesome for winter time to make the rivers and lakes turn into ice, and for the skies to have northern lights, and have high spawn rates of Endermen (since I've always envisioned Endermen and The End to be cold and icy, since there is no Sun or fire in The End), lower spawn rates of spiders (since IRL spiders typically die in the winter), and even rare chances of polar bears spawning in the Winter time for plains biomes and such. This seasons update could also give an excuse to add the Iceologer (or better named the Chillager) and have them spawn during the winter time. It would be awesome for spring and summer to have higher bee and dolphin spawns. The autumn season could have effects where the leaves fall off trees and also turn red, orange, yellow, and so on.</p>\n<p>There's so many possibilities with a Seasons Update in Minecraft. I really do hope Mojang considers this update.</p>",

In winter it would introduce a new challenge for mid game players as the winter would only come once they had sunk in say 20 hours. The winter would need to be shorter than the summer as it would be a pain for late game players. Also introducing tobogganing would be interesting.&nbsp;</p>",

They also would trade backpacks leather armor , and a random cooked meat or bread. All of it would sell for emeralds these guys would not naturaly despawn. They would wander in mountains hiding from mobs at night and traveling in the day time. They also would spawn in camps at the foot of mountains very rarely. The tents would contain chests with random loot the tents would be made out of white wool as the top and fences as decorative supporters. The floor would be made out of oak planks. The chest could generate in the center or off to the side in the tent. This would just be an opportunity to get a hold of some quick hiking gear while on the road</p>",

Crops would grow slower, oak trees wouldn't have leaves so no apples, and animals might die if not fed properly with wheat. So the game would be much harder on the food front in winter. To conpensate this, there would be less hostile mobs spawning in winter, and more hostile mobs would spawn in summer. The super cold biomes (literal ice and snow) are always like in winter, the super hot biomes (deserts) would always be like in summer. For other biomes, the changes would be more or less intense, depending on the biome. Spring and autumn would have the mob spawning normal and food is also normal. Leaves would fall in autumn, and they would grow back in spring, and more flowers would grow in spring. Also bees would produce more honey in spring.</p>",

(<strong>unless it's an icy-looking biome or one that has a lot of flowers already</strong>)</em></p>\n<p><em>Summer, there's still the flowers that appeared in spring and it's much sunnier than before, it also looks brighter outside for a little bit longer. (<strong>if it is a biome that looks cold it doesn't apply or it doesn't show much</strong>)</em></p>\n<p><em>Fall/Autumn, trees become a little bit orange and a leaf effect gets added to make it look like leaves are falling off of the tree's and the ground becomes a lil' bit orange (<strong>depending on what biome</strong>)</em></p>\n<p><em>Winter, Chance of snowing, water will freeze over and it gets darker earlier (<strong>unless it's a desert or something like that</strong>)</em></p>\n<p>Whoever sees this you can add to this idea!</p>",

Growing seasons maybe can vary on temperature and biome, like deserts only grow crops in winter and early spring, and in plains perhaps that is when no crops grow. Humid biomes like jungles might have only a dry and rainy season. Also, I imagine that seasons could affect mobs. For example, a mob might change skin during summer and winter (no animals currently in the game do this that I can think of. Maybe in some seasons, animals spawn in different places, like they spawn in hotter biomes in winter and colder biomes in summer. Also, what if some animals hibernated? Animals like frogs could hibernate. Just some suggestions to build onto this.</p>",

Seasons should change gradually every 4 moon cycles EG winter-4 moon cycles-spring-4 moon cycles...ect.</p>\n<p>Then in all other biomes the seasons only effect: the weather like fog, rain, sun, snow cloudyness and sand storms.

How about we have this seasonal update be a part of a new difficulty, called “realism mode”. We already have the easy, medium, hard, hardcore, and adventure modes. Why not add one more name to the roster, to have the features of seasons and survival like gameplay with more realistic features like larger biomes, as well as adding certain passive animals like cows become neutral like wolves so they may attack if provoked. This way it adds new variety to the game and gives a new and fresh experience to players looking for a new challenge with changes to scenery and a harsher survival experience with the cold and affected crop growth. While not harming other players who want the game to stay as it is. The “seasonal update” can also be really beneficial to builders looking to spruce up their custom builds with a few new seasonal blocks, these blocks would obviously be available in the creative menu but also be only obtainable in the “realism difficulty” thus giving an incentive to try out the new feature. I think this way everyone can get the things they look for in Minecraft, and not have this change infringe on the enjoyment of other players who don’t want it. This way both parties benefit and Minecraft gains a brand new brilliant feature to go along with the “beautiful nature” changes Agnes mentioned, in Mojang’s plans for the Wild Update.</p>",

The focus being that some resources may appear more frequently during a specific season for example, would add a 'Minecraft appropriate' level of strategy to resource collection. Also a factor of adding a seasonal efficiency aspect to farming could excite some of the redstone community without freezing all of their item collection systems or snowing all over their observers lol<br><br>Also, Copper introduced the passage of time as a building aspect, and I believe seasons can do that too. Just to mention that as a side note.<br><br>However, I would rather see changes too resources strategy like plant growth time, animal breeding cooldowns, weather pattern frequency per biome (for snow cauldrons and tridents for example), and mob spawning rules. These three examples could easily express the passage of time in Minecraft without resorting to block state changes like the popular leaf color change suggestion or the freezing water suggestions I have seen in the past.&nbsp;<br><br>Lots more comes to mind, but wanted to share my thoughts on how seasons could impact strategy similarly to how changing ore distribution impacted the strategy of mining.

There are some MC players who play 8 hours a day and I feel like if the seasons changed within that time range it’d be too jarring. There is also something to consider- streamers, or MC multiplayer servers. In servers where players are on nearly 24/7 I think its then it makes sense this really needs to be drawn out.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I am not sure what would be a good time range, but I think it should take several real life days.

Snow blocks should turn into stacked snow layers that decrease as the snow melts. Puddles could be added, too, which will produce steam particles if it is even hotter and could even disappear if it is too hot. Puddles could stack up to a full water source block. This will make the spring season full of ambiance because there will be melting snow and puddles scattered across the ground. Any grass blocks next to a water source or puddle will grow grass, tall grass, and flowers. Or, puddles could seep into the ground, forming a moist version for any soil block, and moist soil will grow grass or flowers. Overall, this would make a beautiful spring scene.</p>",

Seasons and seasonal variants to biomes would immerse the wilds update even more than before.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>and it doesn't have to be the 4 seasons in the traditional sense. Jungle biomes can have a rainy season where it's constantly raining and thundering. Snowy Biomes can have snowstorms that may spawn more snow carpet layers. Of course, the traditional seasons for Common biomes but the idea of months and years in Minecraft sounds incredibly fun. I think people who play on servers would enjoy that a lot because you can set up in world holidays for you and your friends.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>Some feedback regarding this suggestion, based on my personal experiences with a modded form of seasons:<br><br>- Make the seasons toggleable, as well as the crop growth. The look of a biome post-building can detract some players from certain locations in a later season like autumn.<br>- If toggleable, it should be possible to configure season duration, and make it function for multiple players who use Multisleep.<br>- If crop growth will be affected by seasons, there has to be a workaround (such as building a greenhouse)<br>- Tropical biomes can have a 'wet/dry' cycle rather than summer/winter cycle.<br>- If seasons affect biome temperature and weather, that should also be toggleable. A border between cold/moderate biomes can appear really harsh with snow and rain as you jump borders (worse if you actually built there before knowing any of this..)<br>- If a biome's temperature drops for winter, snow should form in the biome and water should freeze.<br>- If weather becomes dependent on season, it should rain more in the spring/autumn, and thunderstorms should be more common in the spring/summer.<br><br>Because seasons would affect more than looks in a world, I feel it should be tied to an update to both weather, and potentially crops and farming as a whole. An outlier to this outfit would be the coloration of trees dependent on biomes (I was pretty awed by Terralith and wish elements of it were vanilla)</p>",

I think that there should be different crop nerfs and buffs depending on the season. For example harvest out put us double in autumn or growth rate is double in summer and half in winter. Sometimes like that where you are still able to grow anytime of the year.

Allow me to explain. This would largely center around farming, as a large portion of the game is dependent upon food, yet there are always ways to automate it (something I'm not against, but it removes the survival aspect to me). Have there be a planting/light growth season (to plant crops), a growing season (for the crops to grow), and then a harvest season (to harvest the crops). Perhaps if you didn't harvest them in time, you would get items such as poisonous potatoes much more frequently. And these seasons can last a very large amount of time too while providing the players with something new to do. You could also farm animals as an alternate to crops during food shortages, but remember, you still need crops to breed them, so choose wisely. Villagers may also trade crops, but in seasons of planting, at a higher price.</p>\n<p>I also believe that there should be some structure/tool/device that is a physical representation of what farming season the game is in at any given time.</p>",

Winters should be colder, wetter, and darker with shorter days, summers should be hotter, drier, brighter with longer days. Obviously this would be relative to the base biome temperature, so ice spikes would vary between normal cold and dangerously cold, deserts between normal hot and dangerously hot. More temperate biomes could vary from hot summers to cold snowy winters, with tropical biomes having wet and dry seasons.</p>\n\n<p>Individual seasons could last anywhere between 30 and 90 days. Initial spawn should occur in spring to allow players plenty of time to explore, collect resources and build a base ahead of winter. In future updates, season specific items, mobs and challenges could be introduced.</p>\n\n<p> To complement this, a temperature management bar should be added to survival mode. If players are too cold or too hot for an extended period, they receive health damage. Being outside in cold biomes, and particularly getting wet, causes cold exposure which can be relieved with proximity to heat sauces or new fur insulated armour; exertion and being in the direct sun in hot biomes causes heat exposure, which must be relieved through resting in the shade, drinking or eating watery foods, or immersion in water. </p>\n\n<p>In combination, these would really add to the unique and fun challenges of different biomes</p>",

This would set a long-term rhythm to the game that players would enjoy the challenge of adapting to (or if not they could just turn it off!).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other than day length, the main changes would be visual (colouration of leaves, grass, etc); weather, crop growing time, mob spawning probabilities; and temperature effects, that could be simultaneously introduced.</p>\n<p>Hot arid biomes (desert, badlands etc) would cycle between warm winters and very hot summers</p>\n<p>Other tropical biomes (savanna, jungle etc) would cycle between warm, dry winters, and hot, wet summers</p>\n<p>Temperature biomes (plains, forests, etc) would have a full 4 season cycle, with some snow in winter</p>\n<p>Cold biomes (taiga, meadow, grove) would have a full 4 season cycle, but with snow remaining into the spring</p>\n<p>Frozen biomes (plains, peaks, slopes) would have a wet snowy summer and a freezing cold winter</p>",

The pig with the crown in the launcher was great but now that it has been removed is saddening. Also, the \"Technoblade never dies\" splash text has around a 1/433 chance of showing! Maybe increase the chance of that happening too? Mojang, if you do infact read these comments and take them into consideration, please, please, add this tribute. Technoblade never dies.</p>",

In my opinion, building on top of the nether in Java is a glitch, much like TNT duplication is a glitch (also a Java parity issue). If Mojang is serious about parity, this needs to be addressed. Another thought would be to remove the ceiling of the nether entirely and just put a hard 256 or 128 build limit the same way the end and over world dimensions have. I understand having floating islands without a ceiling makes the nether look weird so, if having a ceiling helps with that feel. Perhaps just keeping the current nether with a ceiling at 128 and still adding a hard build limit at 128 ceiling would 'fix' the bug in Java.</p>",

Overpowered farms, easy safe transport, and it just looks so out of place. You aren't supposed to be able to get up there, breaking bedrock is a bug, and the Nether roof on Java is ALSO a bug, it was never fixed because the community would just get upset about it. If the Nether roof were to be updated for survival, I want it to ACTUALLY be a feature. Holes in the bedrock leading to a new biome that spawns nothing. No structures, no mobs, mostly baren. The Nether roof is too over-powered, and it has no real function unless you just want to make easy ice boat roads or massive mob farms. If you want a big plot of land for creative mode, flat worlds exist for that express reason.&nbsp;</p>",

The Hermitcraft server has just gotten so much livelier with people able to just start chatting whenever they encounter each other. Used to be they'd go, \"oh hey that's so and so over there I wonder what they're doing\" and just keep going. Now they'll actually wonder over and go, hey what are you doing, or in some cases sneak up on them and creepily look over their shoulder before speaking... hehehehe.<br><br>Now the counter, like it or not, bedrock edition is very clearly targeted at the under 18 demographic, especially realms. Thus voice chat is going to need to be an opt in feature, both for the servers and the users, and it will have to run through Xbox services in order for control to be maintained, especially if you want to see this available on private servers (I sure as heck do). That means, lots of dev work for the Xbox services team as well as Mojang. But... with 700+ votes at time of writing... my bet is, someone, somewhere is working on this, but it's going to take at least 6 months before it's ready for testing let alone ready to roll out to the public.<br><br>That being said, Minecraft isn't the only game in the \"Xbox\" ecosystem that would benefit from proximity chat so maybe that side of things has been in progress for awhile and they're just waiting for game devs to implement it.</p>",

It should be the same as the other voice chat. Only way you hear them if they are unmuted and you have a setting turned on for proximity. If it’s ticked off you can’t hear them when they are within a certain range, making the proximity setting useful if you are close to the player and if you aren’t. Most people would keep both settings turned on, unless they are nearby someone noisy. Each player should have their personal mute. That way other players can still be heard.</p>",

Just not a major difference. Anyway, I see this more being an issue in Multiplayer than I do Singleplayer.

A reoccurring event could also be a good opportunity to get good items or something rare, and maybe even fight something rare (or just a cool variant of the current mobs). Maybe even a wave system, similar to the raid system. I feel that once I get good armor and weapons the combat becomes trivial and stale, even.</p>\n<p>However, I do agree with the others who are suggesting a random event instead of an event every single new moon. Also, I think one of 2 things should happen when you try to sleep: You either get a message saying you can't sleep now or you get a warning message informing you that, if you go to sleep, you will be skipping the event. They could also make it to where if you sleep and skip the event, it happens again the next night and so on.</p>",

(The moon's phase does not influence the normal spawning of slimes in designated chunks at altitudes below y=40.)</li>\n<li>The fuller the moon, the higher the chance skeletons and zombies have the ability to pick up items and spawn with weapons and armor. Furthermore, there is a higher chance for their equipment to be enchanted, and if it is, the enchantment levels are higher. A fuller moon also gives spiders a greater chance to spawn with random beneficial status effects, including invisibility. All of these effects combine with the world's difficulty; with higher difficulty levels increasing the chance of mob buffs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Taken from the wiki.

It would be cool if we could see a new wave based event in the 1.17 update maybe incorporating one or more of the mobs teased in the Minecraft live 2020 advert. An idea for this could be a moon rabbit event including two possible options for summoning, one being putting a carrot on a beacon in a mountain biome at night which spawns a more passive event where the rabbits are friendly. The other being putting a rabbit foot on a beacon in a mountain biome at night which spawns a wave based angry rabbit army with large, medium and small(normal) sized rabbits and some sort of weapon. perhaps the small rabbits ride on the backs of goats(if they are added in the update). I just thought this would be a fun side event to add to the game that would maybe add a new item or two to the game. Please vote if you like the idea.</p>",

The only thing that would be remotely possible to run would be 10 or so wave particle effects per chunk. This couldn't actually interact with the player but would simulate a current that changed through out the day in deep water biomes. This is already kinda bad and probably couldn't look particularly good.</p>\n<p>That being said, why tho? It's not very necessary and I don't think that it would add to the game, even then you would have to argue the hundreds of hours spent on a feature in a place that got one of the biggest updates yet very recently was the best choice in place of a Cave or an End update.</p>",

The waves would be tied to a line of these special water blocks that are teleporting in a specific direction/angle over the water. To keep the waves moving, the water has to flow away from the source blocks fast enough to extend to the furthest block it can before the source block line teleports again. This would be easy to impliment for one-block high waves (would mainly just be tweaking values in a water source copy), but I'm not sure how they would accomplish going any higher than that. They could possibly utilize the new feature of local water levels in caves and impliment it for waves? If they make boats able to float/row up flowing water, then it would be great.

Perhaps these could be wave-like-mobs, mobs that look a lot like waves and could push you out onto shore.</p>\n<p>Admittedly this does have some visual problems, such as how would it look if you had a bunch of waves just randomly moving? Wouldn't look right. So maybe these \"Waves\" (Wakes) would try to target the shore? And then despawn at the shore. Though if they weren't that common, about as common as Dolphins or Pufferfish (in a warm ocean biome), then I think there wouldn't be as many issues with it. As a bonus, this would give a player added reason to get in a boat, as they would be unaffected by the Wakes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I don't think they should be hostile if this was to become a thing, however, it could be made so that the Wakes become aggressive during thunderstorms. During a thunderstorm they should try and drag you under the water instead of push you to the shore. Not very far under the water, just a few blocks under.</p>",

Just detach the joy cons, add a second player, and there you have it, but the texts in the split screen when the console is in handheld mode will be hard to read.

Is the only reason you have not put in Split Screen For Windows is because on Console you can login to 2 Separate accounts at the same time Via Console options? and with Windows you can only be in one account at a time? If this is it. maybe you should put in sign in Options right in the game so Player 2 can just login on there side of the screen M+KB doesn't have to be a player 1 dedication.. also using a Xbox Controller Dongle you can have up to 10 Controllers connected at at time. M+KB wouldn't even be required or needed while playing. making it where everyone can just sit back with a controller and relax.</p>",

I just cannot fathom why they are not pushing for this. My only assumption is they think that couch coop is for consoles hooked up to TVs.

However, the lack of split-screen support prevents this possibility, making the Windows 11 experience inferior without any clear justification.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1013\" data-end=\"1279\">Adding split-screen support would make the Windows 11 experience more complete and accessible, allowing more players to enjoy the game in the same way it is already available on consoles.

        "body": "<p>Recently Mojang has been pushing both Bedrock and Java as a combined package deal to sell the game. However, for MacOS users they may buy the same package and yet are only capable of using Minecraft Java Edition. Seeing as how both games are being pushed as a package deal, Minecraft would likely sell more if both games were actually offered to MacOS users. I would also like to make it apparent that Minecraft Bedrock Edition is available on IOS rather than Java (due to system compatibility issues), making Bedrock popular. In the past this might have been incentivized by users buying both versions, but seeing as how now both editions are being sold together this no longer holds any incentive. Rather, there are many disincentives that come along with Bedrock Edition not being available. Bedrock players would like to play MC on their Macs and will pay for it. These audiences are likely to buy the packaged deal if Minecraft Bedrock Edition is made available on MacOS. This is true because they’re able to maintain their communities and groups they play with on Bedrock Edition, while also exploring Minecraft Java Edition. Moving forward I see MC Bedrock Edition being made available to MacOS users as both a legitimate way to make money for Mojang, along with a way for longtime Bedrock players to enjoy the version they are used to. Both interests align and therefore pursuing the release of MC Bedrock Edition on MacOS will be in the best interest of players and developers alike. </p>",

However, I feel like it is cruel if you are paying the same amount of money as somebody who has a windows PC for a game, that over half of it, you cannot use. I also think as well, many Apple products such as the ipad as well as the iphone have decided to make cross play accessible by using Bedrock edition. I think this issue however lies inside of Apple, as well as Mojang. I think minecraft is one of those games that it should be on every single device, with crossplay being a major must when being able to play minecraft. When you think about how diverse the minecraft community is, and how popular Bedrock is in comparsion to Java, it just does not make a lot of sense for them to do Java instead of Bedrock. I do not think a lot of people would be complaining if it was the other way around. Bedrock edition just seems more useful for somebody who would for example, play on macbook. When we think about people who play on macbook, they are usually not game intensive and do not need things like mods and texture packs, most are going to be people who just wanna play with other people.&nbsp;</p>",

A voice chat button could be added so that players playing with their friends can communicate easily without having to type in the chat.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve played many multiplayer games that already include built-in voice chat, and it really improves the overall gaming experience.</p>\n\n<p>If, for some reason, this feature can’t be added directly, then at least an official voice chat add-on could be created. That way, players who want to use voice chat would still have the optio</p>",

But right now, the most critical upgrade MCPE needs isn't a new block; it's basic, functional communication.\n<br />We need built-in, cross-platform voice chat more than any other feature.\n<br />While a new structure is a temporary novelty, voice chat is the foundation of modern, collaborative multiplayer.\n<br />Why VC is a Higher Priority:\n<br /> * True Cross-Play: We play on Bedrock so we can connect with friends on PC, console, and mobile. But connecting isn't enough; we need to communicate efficiently. Typing on a small screen or pausing the game to type a complex message breaks the flow and puts us at a huge disadvantage against PC players who can type almost instantly. VC levels the playing field.\n<br /> * Seamless Collaboration: Imagine building a massive project, fighting the Warden, or setting up a complex Redstone circuit. Trying to coordinate this with text chat is slow, clunky, and often leads to mistakes. Voice chat enables real-time strategy, quick directions, and instant teamwork.\n<br /> * Community and Connection: Minecraft is a social game. VC makes the multiplayer experience more engaging, fun, and personal. It fosters genuine community on servers and lets us feel closer to our friends, no matter what device they're using.\n<br />A new mob is cool, but voice chat is what truly modernizes the Bedrock experience and unlocks the full potential of cross-play. Let's prioritize the feature that enables </p>",

It should be added as an official feature in a future minor update, so players can talk to each other directly without needing any external apps or mods.</p>\n\n<p>The voice chat option could appear in the Settings menu, just like other accessibility or audio settings. There could also be a push-to-talk button or an automatic voice detection option for easier communication on mobile, console, and Windows.</p>\n\n<p>Many multiplayer games already include built-in voice chat, and it makes the overall gaming experience much more social and enjoyable. Being able to talk while building, exploring, or surviving together would make Minecraft even better for friends and community players.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, Minecraft Bedrock players have no safe or official way to use voice chat, unlike Java players who have mods for it. That’s why it would be amazing if Mojang officially adds built-in voice chat to Bedrock Edition in an upcoming minor update.</p>\n\n<p>This would greatly improve teamwork, communication, and fun for millions of players worldwide!</p>",

So what if you could maybe put shulker boxes or ender chests on a boat? Maybe it doesn't seem like it fits like the chest boat does, but just throwing it out there. The only problem with this, is if you have shulker boxes, you likely have an elytra, and boats wouldn't be the most convenient mode of transportation. So this throws out another idea: what if there was some kind of late game incentive to use boats? Perhaps caves that generate with a local water level will likely have a variation where a long stretch of water will be safe to traverse via boats, but not enough space to safely fly through with an elytra.</p>",

You still lie in the bed (like you're sleeping in), until you click \"Leave Bed\".

Why not lay down in bed without sleeping and maybe have a slow health regeneration affect.&nbsp;<br><br>Why do this at night?<br>Maybe you need to go AFK or something and rather than standing while mobs spawn, just lay in the bed. (Which you can do in MP. You can lay in bed and get the eyes closed animation and \"sleep but not sleep\")&nbsp;<br><br>To make either more useful and effective, rather than \"skipping the night\" this alternate use can simply make it so mobs do not spawn in X radios around you. Or, you can make this the normal function and in the event you are in SP or everyone on the server sleeps, the game can prompt all players asking if they want to sleep through the night before progressing to do so. Both are simple, and they give the bed a dynamic use outside of just \"skip the night\".<br><br>As someone above stated and I agree with, this is also useful for Role Playing (if your into that sort of thing, I wont judge).

Which could also make for a nice opportunity to add a sort of makeshift alarm clock, the recipe could be 2 bells opposite of each other at the top of the crafting matrix, a clock in the center with redstone on either side of it and gold ingots filling in the top and bottom center areas with sticks being in the bottom left and right corners. Right-clicking on it will bring up a little UI allowing you to set the time the clock will wake you up at. The UI could allow you to set the time via a simplified or complicated method, simplified being the 24-hour format and the complicated one being set via the tick you want to be awoken at.</p>",

This way, all player can lay on bed without skipping the night and maybe enable the lay on bed action at day but without the vote button (or maybe just add it too so players can skip the day). And if there's only one player online, it would be 1 vote out of 1 (number of player online, which currently there's only one) needed. The vote progress (or whatever) will be showed in the chat but that could turn into a spam so maybe show it like the text when you play a music disc (on top of the hotbar).</p>\n<p>This way, old features (like the all player must sleep to skip the night) will still be there while adding more options for players.</p>",

If we were to change the fact that you can only sleep at night I think it would take away from a nostalgic part about this game. And his game has been around for a very long time and I think it has nostalgia for most everyone who plays it. And I think that would take away a piece of the nostalgia</p>",

(Which the game would keep track of from the beginning of this \"time update\" if the game doesn't already somehow memorize entire states or track time). Since Minecraft mostly autosaves now and there's no way to turn it off, this could be a great way to revisit destroyed structures or bring back the dead (if named with a nametag), and undo whatever the players wished. It wouldn't have to be too complex at first, and I mean that as if it wouldn't need to track the position of every mob (unless maybe they were named with a nametag). Just mostly block placement and world states over time.</p>",

Metal could increase the range of effect though. The best way to do this is to have a lightning entity spawn and it searches for the closest block within ~32 meters. if it fails then it spawns 1 to 2 lightning entities in a semi random location below it withing this 63 meter sphere/cube. If it touches ground all of the lightning entities will be connected with a blinding whiteish streak. Full metal armor would also completely block lightning damage as it will redirect the electricity, i won't get into details, because I really should have done this as a different post, but i have seen this done many times, including people touching cages that were struck by lightning at the same time.</p>",

It would be best if the tree fell away from the player so as not to cause damage from chopping wood. For trees with a base wider than 1 block, the tree should fall after the last base block is chopped. Only half of the treetop should be left after the tree falls so the tree can lay horizontally against the ground. This would make clearing the top of the tree possible without building scaffolding or setting a block staircase next to the tree to get to the top of it. You would still need to chop the rest of the wood blocks with the axe and clear the treetop if so desired. This would keep the game balanced but make chopping down a tree more reasonable and not leave tree tops floating in the sky.</p>",

This would probably take a lot of changes to fix how the world generate, save, and may not be viable for weaker systems like phones.

Quickly identifying the next opaque block millions of blocks away really doesn't require the engine to search every block.</p>\n<p>Honestly the world doesn't need to be millions of blocks tall, but within this methodology alone, you would be able to find the next opaque block to any location in 8 lookups to a world 262,144 blocks tall.

New oceans should make use of this new space and stretch to barely above bedrock at the deepest parts.<br>- New content to fill the much more expansive underground *cough* <strong>cave update</strong> *cough*<br>- Taller mountains making use of the new vertical space.

I think this tends to be mostly due to the lack of variance between the structures created and the size of them. Just some examples are the single - room desert temple (which is a classic, not necessarily complaining), the 3x3x3 tunnels of the stronghold, and the ocean temple (which was an improvement, but always generates the same way with hardly any important details in the structure. I just feel that new structures added (and possibly pre-existing ones too) should have larger size and grandeur. I think Minecraft tends to struggle with making something ominous and grand. They end up being somewhat hard to find and not worth finding twice (jungle temple.) To complement this change and the larger structures it would bring, it would make sense to increase the build limit, but probably not by just making mountains taller. I think either increasing the space underground for these new structures to generate or increasing space above ground would be a much appreciated change for many players (mostly builders) that play in Vanilla Minecraft. I wouldn't consider the extra space \"wasted\" either because it makes for a great canvas for many great builders.</p>",

The developers are actually starting to implement it on the Java Edition, since they lowered the void from -1 and below to -64 and below and allowed players to control build height using custom worlds in the snapshots, according to the Minecraft Wiki. I'm sure the challenge would be trying to implement a new height limit that all operating Bedrock devices could handle; they already set up the performance limit and gave up on some devices including Gear VR, so they are working towards that. I'm sure that if this manages to get implemented, the height limit would be increased to 384, and the lowering they've done to the void also suggests that they are going decrease the level of bedrock (the block) in order to give more space to the underground. I'm sure the undergound would severely need that with the new cave generation and biomes coming up, so that's why the new height limit might be necessary, as well as raising up mountains.</p>",

On Saturday I just finished up terraforming the right tower with my friend. I am also going to put full interior on it but it will not be finished for a long time but I am hoping I can get it done by august. If we can get 512 build limit or more, that will mean I could build even higher. Although I would assume the tallest I could make on a regular world would be 443 meters tall or 1453 ft which would be pretty high. So I am really hoping that they can increase the limit to 512 or higher so I can but even higher, which you wouldn't think I would be doing in survival, but I would still do it because I would really like to be able to make a skyscraper as high as possible in my survival world. So Mojang really should increase the limit to atleast 512. Also I cant believe that cant even build anything above 1000 ft.</p>",

I'd really love to see you keeping this April Fool as some kind of option during world generation. You could for example add the 'Infinite Dimensions' button right besides the 'Cheats: On/Off' button. As this may be very op, this seems like the right place for this button to be. Pro's: We may experience items, blocks and mobs from coming updates in the infinite amount of generations. Which wouldn't be possible otherwise. As the worlds are not random, we may experience the upbringing of an art, where people who know how to code dimensions generate some for the community. Literally everything will be possible. This may be the birth of a new mechanic for knowledge exchange, right besides redstone, building and pvp metas. Why spend years on building worlds, which are limited anyway, if you could generate them (given that you have the patience to learn the seed-language)? Cons: As this'd be optional, there aren't any. About bugfixing: So long everything outside of the Plain of Infinite Worlds works, there are no bugs. Only features. Please remove Herobrine during the next snapshot, instead of this genuinely awesome feature. The next update may hold the potential for the player to ultimately generate worlds by the exact way he wants them to be.</p>",

You can earn succulent rewards or special achievements by completing quests that include the books. You will have to complete the events within the different dimensions, but do not get too attached to what you see, because once you return to the overworld the inventory will not be preserved.</p>\n<p>Dimensions can be completely random and completely meaningless.

You should not be able to write your own Ender Tome because it would be too easy to simply find a seed that has infinite diamond blocks or ancient debris.

It can be in almost all biomes and profundities. It would be very big (100 x 30 x 100 blocks), made of stone bricks and its variants. Its shape is like a dome, and in ruins. The inside resembles a castle and it is full of hostile mobs (except illagers) and complex redstone traps. There is a good loot in chests, but the most valuable thing there is the portal, in the center of the building.</p>\n<p>The portal room has walls and ceiling of obsidian, and the portal isn’t lit. To charge it, players have to craft the power sphere(I already said I’m bad with names?) with a dragon egg in the center, four nether stars in the corners, one block of netherite in the top, one block of diamond in the bottom, and two eternity totems in the sides. The only use of the power sphere is to light the portal (sorry for everyone who thought in making a sword with it). And after you light the portal, something goes <strong>out</strong>&nbsp;of it...</p>\n<p>The final boss, Superior Level. And this time, you won’t win easily, because your opponent... is <strong>YOU!</strong></p>\n<p>Superior level has Steve’s or Alex’s skin, if the player uses one of those. Otherwise&nbsp;it is randomly decided. (And can it have white glowing eyes too?)</p>\n<p>It uses a obsidian armor (enchanted) and can teleport, mine blocks very quickly with obsidian tools (also enchanted) and give 10 hearts of damage with the obsidian sword (enchanted too). It also has a bow(enchanted), powerful effects(regeneration, resistance, strength and others, depending on the difficulty) and can place blocks. He has 20 hearts of health and attack everything (but will prioritize the player and won’t attack anything until the player is dead or something is attacking it.</p>\n<p>If killed, the portal’s color will change to white (or another color that fits better) and won’t change, no matter what. When the player enters it, they will be in a castle or mansion (Superior Level’s lair). This dimension is similar to the overworld, but is always night and thunderstorm, and no mobs will spawn there. Then, a piston door will open and Superior Level will be at the other side, and destroy the return portal when see the player (it respawned), but with netherite armor, weapons and tools, and potions instead of effects. It will try to protect a blue block, called respawning block, which makes it respawn when killed, but with worse equipment. If the block is destroyed, Superior Level can be killed for good. When it is finally killed, the return portal will reappear and the player will have the infinity portal.</p>\n<p>Oh, and instead of using normal books, the portal is changed with special books that need to be signed with a kind of enchanted table for books, that costs some levels of Xp.</p>\n<p>I think this will be a great challenge.</p>\n<p>These are my ideas, hope you liked!</p>",

It seems like it is a combination of the same x components all the time and many dimensions share features like no caves or insane daylight-night-cycles. That strains my PC a LOT. Why not make any duration for a day kinda equally likely based on a logarithmic function? so that 1/10 of the usual cycle is as likely as 10x the usual cycle and so on?

I watch my young kids play all day in creative mode and infinite access to stuff doesn’t ruin the game for them, instead it actually makes the game accessible to them. So based on that, I counter the argument that it would destroy the nature of Minecraft.</p>\n\n<p>Let Minecraft survival endgame stay sane, but add this feature for fun, via cheats.</p>\n\n<p>As for the bloat it would cause for mobile users... well yes and no. An infinite overworld has the same potential to bloat, albeit quite a bit slower. But I know that I could create 100 new worlds on my device for the thrill of adventuring and discovery and I would end up running out of space. There would need to be a cloud offloading management feature added perhaps.</p>\n\n<p>Bloat could also be mitigated by making dimension worlds limited to a certain number of chunks if they are to be persistent rather than transient dimensions. This could be determined by the user (as it currently is, with the create world type selector [flat/infinite/old]) or by device resource limitations.</p>\n\n<p>I also like the “dual seed” idea. Instead of just having the text directly seed the dimension, have the book text hash with the world seed (or perhaps the portal coordinates/geometry/any combination of variables to salt the hash)</p>\n\n<p>Doing so would add an astonishing intrigue that would make for countless experiences.</p>",

I do not think it a bad idea, in survival elytra are hard enough to find and get as well as being extremely easy to lose. even without a chest piece potions and enchantments can make you pretty OP. no matter how op it is though one miss step and the elytra and all the enchanted gear finds its self under a large pool of lava or at the bottom of the Abbys. the added armor is just going to lure people into a false sense of security which will more often than, causing them to miss step and lose all their gear anyway.&nbsp; If you add in having to beat some boss to get some special item to unlock that back slot on top of that, with some extremely difficult or expensive recipe. I do not see it has a bad idea at all or broken. - maybe a reason to add in a Lava Cracken in the Nether?&nbsp; whats an expanded inventory or some back bling really going to hurt? the more players can customize the look of their character the better, helps keep the players invested.&nbsp; By the time you are farming out the End regular mobs stop being much of a worry anyway.&nbsp; I like the Idea &nbsp;</p>",

Picking up silver fish doesn't seem neccessary, but why not, one more item to collect and probably cool to have something besides chicken eggs to store mobs in chests.</p>\n<p>Picking up spawners is the big one, which people might disagree on, but spawners are never going to be a top tier farm, they are super rare, super manual and highly unreliable to \"farm\". All of that said, it would be incredibly cool to have spawners to show off and use creatively. I never break spawners, but building around them is such a hassle and their density is just too low, to do anything cool with them by default. I saw some guys use single spawners for PvE arenas, but that's not great.</p>\n<p>I would love to have this, even if you had to repair the spawner on the anvil and use a lot of xp and maybe some material. To me even netherite would be worth it, ghast tears or nether stars. Something from the nether would feel right for some reason.</p>",

Then make a 16x16x3 farm and farm and sell too get emeralds now you have emeralds too buy the books</p>",

        "body": "<p>I don't understand the hesitation when it comes to spawners. The only things they would be decent for would be larger scale blaze, drowned and skeleton farms. Skeleton farms are practically useless because crimson nylium flower farms give stupidly high amounts of bone meal, and bows and low tier armour aren't really worth farming. Drowned farms are useful for copper but to make a semi efficient farm with spawners would make the structure huge, not really worth it for anything else. Larger blaze farms would be pretty useful though, but not overpowered. There are much more efficient ways of gaining XP without the use of spawners (guardian farms, gold farms, even furnaces), and fuel is extremely easy to farm in multiple different ways (wither skeletons, kelp, bamboo, trees). My point being, the idea is good and silk touch II doesn't need to be insanely rare for it to be balanced, at least in the way OP has set it up. Having an enchantment that allows players to obtain breakable unobtainable items is just a cool thing to have imo. Not gamebreaking but not entirely useless either</p>",

I don't think it makes sense to me to limit both console and PC bedrock players with this feature because it's a hard problem to solve for touch screens. Please let us use off-hand, this feature alone would make bedrock edition 10x better and maybe even better than Java, nostalgia aside.</p>",

Right now, the offhand slot in Bedrock is very limited and can only hold a few specific items like shields or totems.</p>\n\n<p>It would be great if Bedrock players could use the offhand for more items, such as torches, food, maps, and arrows. This would make survival and exploration much easier and more balanced between Java and Bedrock editions.</p>\n\n<p>Also, please consider adding new customizable button options, especially for mobile and console players. For example, a separate button to use or switch offhand items, and the ability to rearrange or resize buttons freely on the screen.</p>\n\n<p>These changes would make gameplay more flexible, comfortable, and fair for all Bedrock players.\n<br />Thank you for reading and for continuing to make Minecraft better! 💚</p>",

For a good Cave Update, underground should be layered and the depth of it should at least be quadrupled. What I mean by layered is that blocks should be harder to break and the difficulty level of caves should also increase (with traps, with environmental hazards such as lava, poisonous plants, blocks that slow you down etc. and most importantly with new and strong hostile mobs!) as the player digs down. If this is not done correctly, the update will be very disappointing. P.S if someone from Mojang is reading this, Terraria's underground is a perfect example for you to be inspired by.</p>",

In older worlds it could be retrofitted by generating in negative y coordinates, and the bedrock-layer is exchanged by a different block while converting the world to the new format. It just seems so logical to do. And at the same time, having much taller mountains would help a lot too with the new cliffs!

While this would not allow for more room to dig, it would still be very satisfying for large scale build projects and also leave room for larger mountain generation.
