I stop paying attention for a couple of days on a build project or adventure and they all fly off north into the desert. North is desert, south and east is the rest of the town and west is the sea. They consistently can be found wandering the desert, famous for its flowers and then drowning in the rivers, sometimes even on the way back following me with a flower.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'd love them to be able to remember where their hive is, or even for a way to feed a single bee a honey block to make it a queen which can spawn babies on its own so long as there is an available space. That'd be great and so much less tedious effort. They're super cute and useful, but the thought of keeping them indoors instead of flying around the town into the flowerbeds is tragic :(</p>",

You can’t tame the leader. You can only tame non-hostile gorillas, and some gorillas will spawn hostile.\n<br />- when you breed them, they are automatically tame\n<br />- when you kill them, you can get leather as well as wool\n<br />- you can ride tamed gorillas with a saddle\n<br />- a tamed gorilla will always follow you, but will have different traits (ex: some can be ridden, some can protect you, some can carry a chest)\n<br />- you can befriend a pack of gorillas by befriending the leader, they won’t be tame but they won’t be hostile and there is a chance they will bring you bananas\n<br />- some packs protect temples, and those packs are all instantly hostile\n<br />I know that some of this might be a bit complex or chance based for the game, but any of these ideas cherry picked would be awesome!</p>",

It makes sense, seeing as other \"obscure pet-like mobs\" are being added (axolotl), Terraria has also decided to add it (Eucalyptus Sap item), and there is only parrots/bats/bees as passive/neutral flying mobs.</p>\n<p>Sugar gliders are an insectivore who gets their name from their sweet tooth, as they love eating berries, but they also like to eat small bugs such as spiders, beetles, etc, and will move to more plant-based foods again as fall arrives. They are about the size of an axolotl. These critters also love to climb, which would bring more life to the skies of Minecraft.</p>\n<p>Having more life to the skies of Minecraft that a sugar glider can give both in the jungle and other forested areas is helpful while each biome is currently being renovated. They also can take the new crops to eat (shown in Minecon live as being worked on in the future). Cannot be tamed but only friended, as they aren't domesticated. While cute, gliders are very timid and take a lot of space to remotely get them to trust you, so it would also be a means to help encourage players to make animal spaces other than the \"traditional\" small, fenced area for breeding massive amounts of cows and the lone fence-with-a-lead for the poor horse. Having it also be a means to promote more berries/trees without destruction would be nice, seeing as the first thing you do in Minecraft is deforest.</p>",
