However if its connected by a copper wire to a lightning rod it will actually have the ability to beam the lightning in another direction. This could possibly be steered by insulators or by other nearby lightning rods it would be attracted to. Basically the lightning rod would receive lightning while the tesla coils will output it. If there aren't any lightning rods nearby then it may instead head to the nearest mob so long as its touching the ground. And if both multiple lightning rods or mobs are nearby it may split into smaller weaker versions of lightning to each of them. If it's in the water then I stead will get an area effect around it where it does damage withing a certain radius, when lightning powered the radius and damage increases for that short second.</p>",

Also the tesla coils will only focus their electricity at each other if they are 4 blocks apart any further from that they will not focus their electricity.</p>",

The wandering trader is cool, but i never buy anything from them, i usually just kill them and the Llammas for the leads and the chance of extra leather. Maybe add a chance for them to sell some redstone components, other than slimeballs. If a new villager is added he should not be in every village. Villages he is in would have things like redstone defenses and automatic lights, etc and be rarer than the abandoned villages. I like the idea of a new table as well and even a guidebook to go with it, that is only accessible through the tables UI. This table could also open up later features that are more complicated and require the table to be powered to use. I hope more people share their ideas on this. Good thinking.</p>",

Ziel von diesem ist es bei z.b. Redstone Bepowerung ein Vorher eingestelltes Craftingrezept automatisch auszuführen. Die Items werden mit einem Hopper in den Block geführt,und sobald die benötigten Items da sind wird etwas gecraften. Dazu könnte man zum einstellen evt. das gewünschte Rezept dort einfügen. Also einmal alle Items in der benötigten Formation einfügen. Ich denke über diesen Block würden sich sehr viele Spieler freuen. Außerdem würde er die Farming-Scene extrem pushen.</p>\n<p>Lg Ben</p>",

However, there would have to be some more limitations - you could send and item to the nether, transport it into another one right next to it and then send it back to the overworld in a totally different location... To solve this issue, I think that you should have to place the dragon egg on top of the sending Ender Hopper in order for it to work. This would mean that only one connection can be used (unless you dupe the dragon egg.... but lets just imagine they fix every duping glitch). The system would be useful for sending items back home when your inventory is full - you could just place the hopper and dragon egg, and then throw items into it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Alternatively, to provide more than one set of hoppers being used, you could replace the dragon egg with a live shulker. It would be very difficult to get one to sit on top, but would make sense as shulkers are an end mob.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I also think that the hole in the top of the hopper should look like the end portal inside :)</p>",
