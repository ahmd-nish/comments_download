Only when everything is fully repair, should the exp go to the player.<br><br>So far, all the youtubers and twichers I've watched, do something in common! Every single time they want to repair their items, they remove those that are already full so that the exp doesn't go automaticaly to the player's exp. And removing the gear, they expose themselfs and risk to die. I think they should just change it. No need for chosing the lowest durability item or split 50-50 something.

        "body": "<p>How about a tool to sculpt a special material? very similar to the block of cheese on the moon, which you can \"sculpt\" using your hand into interesting shapes.</p>\n<p>The tool can be made with 1 copper bar and a stick. It could be carved in limited blocks, for example quartz, gold, stone, rock, andesite, granite, barkless logs, copper, polished sandstone, and undyed terracotta. They could take advantage of the fact that the theme of 1.20 is about expressing yourself and customizing everything in a more dynamic way. It may not be so complicated to do, since it would only be using the configuration given to the blocks of cheese but in the materials already mentioned. The detail would be that you cannot save or chop the sculpture and store it in your inventory, but you could move it using pistons, or using carts as if they were an entity. If you poke the sculpture it breaks without releasing an item.</p>\n<p>I'm using traslator to write haha sorry if there´s any misurestanding.</p>",

Maybe throwing it in fire or lava creates a small pillar of flame, as the fire ignites the trapped air.
