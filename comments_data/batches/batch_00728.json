Right now, even if you have a setup that only allows certain signal strengths through, simply walking nearby it still activates the sculk sensor which means that it can't detect anything else for 2 seconds, so sculk sensors are still very susceptible to interference that might cause it to miss the vibration you're actually looking for.</p>\n<p>For example, what if you wanted to detect when someone shot a projectile? Well, they would have to walk into the sculk sensor's range, which would activate it, leaving you with 2 full seconds of absolutely no detection every time they took a step in it's radius. You would have to manually try to stop the interference by standing still for 2 seconds then shooting, which kinda defeats the purpose. And it will be pretty much impossible to use in mob farms because the overwhelming amount of walking vibrations will keep it constantly activated even if that signal is going nowhere.</p>\n<p>Walking is the big problem here but I think it should also muffle the Hit Ground and Projectile Land events.</p>",

This way when you load areas it loads the 16 blocks above and below you until you hit 8x8 chunks (for example number could change)&nbsp; around you. Only after that number got hit would it start generating or loading up and down another 16 blocks.</p>\n<p>I know it would probably be much harder than my quick example but i think it would have the potential for a substantial performance increase.</p>",

It seemed like most of the developers were hoping for the iceologer to win anyways, and yet a useless mob won. It would make a lot more people happy if they just added it with this update anyways. There would also be a lot less hate in the community that boiled within those weeks. Many people were afraid the iceologer would be another phantom, but it <em>just</em> has to be developed right. It doesn't even fly. That would be a real nice thing from the developers to the community.</p>",
