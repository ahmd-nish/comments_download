        "body": "<p>I was going to do another article on items but I guess talking about one won't hurt...</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Totem of Exanimate is somewhat rare item that has a not-very decent durability (yes, I said durability) of 153 points (this may be changed). When you hold the Totem of Exanimate it loses one point of durability every 20 seconds when a Undead mob is around. When a Undead mob is around, they don't attack you, instead, if there's a alive hostile mob it'll help you fight them. This list will show all the mobs this includes (one of them are (I guess) alive): Zombie, Drowned, Husk, Zombie Villager, Skeleton, Stray, Wither Skeleton, Zombie Pigman, Phantom, and Ghast. However, the more Undead mobs there are the faster the durability goes, since with one mob it takes 15 seconds to lose one durability point, if you add one it drops to 14 seconds and so on, until you get to 15 where then it just loses one durability point every second.&nbsp;Also, if you place a Totem of Exanimate in a Item Frame, it will deter undead mobs without losing durability. The range is 15 blocks. Just a bit of trivia, if a fox has a Totem of Exanimate and a zombie pigman is nearby and you attack the fox, the pigman will become aggro. I hope this answers your question AridPluto91. I hoping this will become a thing, however, I need A LOT of support so it's very unlikely. Anyways, thanks for asking, I had fun typing, have a nice day! :)</p>",

One day, an severally harmed adventurer, Mill, fainted in a dark forest from his injuries. A kind medium (That magic doesn't create warts, but it does turn the skin unnaturally pale), Saria, saw him collapse, and healed him. He thanked her, paid her, and then left. 2 months later, this happened again, only Mill walked to her house and asked. This became normal, and they soon became close. 4 years later, Mill secretly married Saria and built a vast mansion for her and her expected children. They had twins, named Piller and Eve. Eve learned all she could about magic from her mother, while Piller set out to explore. Piller soon found a village, where he was nearly stoned to death. Piller tried another village. Same thing. Piller and Eve were furious. As the years turned into decades, and the decades into centuries, the Villagers forgot their wrongs, but the Pillagers and the Evokers never forgot.</p>",

Curators would reward you for finding unusual materials from other dimensions (and now from archeological and fossil digs), as well as for adding to museum exhibits (I wanted a nether exhibit where players would build an incomplete altar, an item frame to display a nether star in, a place to build a small obsidian pillar with and end crystal on top, odd quests like that). In addition, they would sell uncraftable bobbles like <a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360055862791-Storm-Globe-Small-Magical-Control-of-Weather-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">storm globes</a> to the player, ideally at ridiculous prices.

First, new mechanics. When aggravated, it could teleport the player at some blocks of height so it also recieves fall damage. But even with cooldown, endermen farms would be broken, since lots of them would teleport you at a time.</p>\n<p>They could increase - but a little bit - health and damage, kind of 48 health and 8 damage in normal difficulty. I'm not such a big fan, because their power would assimilate the enderdragon's and they'd be very hard to deal in warped forests, for example.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But endermen would be awesome with these ideas. You have my vote.</p>\n<p>Another thing: You pointed out \"regenerate a bit of health\". Only a few mobs can do this and it would be a nice addition to the game.&nbsp;</p>",

So I did wanted to replace him with new one from creative using the egg, I did placed stone cutter and spawned him next to it - surprise - he was fisherman .. ugh .. as barels are everywhere in my area because nice decoration being it also job block is so problematic ... same with cauldrons ... ok so that did not worked so I did moved like 200 blocks away from everything, created dirt room with 3 block high walls, put stone cutter inside, spawned villager - surprise - he was cartographer .. what the hell .. that is not that common block and the only one I knew was like 300 blocks away and breaking it did not helped .. I have no idea where he got that idea. I had to spawn like 10 of them until one finally picked the stone cutter next to it (the only block they had access to), separate him and lava the rest. I did also had to install iron doors and buttons to not loose any of them anymore and they still tend to get stuck in their houses (I guess problems with stairs and top slab floors?) not finding bed or their workstation and those houses are not that complicated (plain noodle or L shape with ground level, one floor and basement undecorated yet). Those mechanics should not bring that much frustration :/</p>",
