You think that progression in Minecraft is very easy, but a lot of casual Survival players have never even laid their hands on Diamonds. Only about 10% of Bedrock players have ever gone through the End. The Bundle is meant to be for those exploring the world around them in the early game, not really bothering about the progression. Late-game and mid-game players already have Shulker boxes, and the Bundle is not meant to be a substitute for that. For early and mid-game players, which is the majority of people, the Bundle would be very valuable.</p>",
