It’s essentially “smart routing”, which I can see why people would say it doesn’t feel vanilla or why it might be difficult to implement, though I do know a Plugin that implemented this well, but I'm not sure whether or not it would actually work in vanilla.<br><br>Maybe instead it would be better to make it so that you can simply switch tracks by pressing W A S D on your keyboard. For instance, you’re starting at stop A, and there is a junction ahead of you; the left side goes to stop B and the right side goes to stop C. You want to go to stop C, so you simply press “D” (or whatever your keybind for going right is), and it switches you to that track.<br><br>I can see this becoming an issue with larger railway systems however, where you could have several junctions after one another, essentially forcing you to play <em>Where’s Wally</em> with less than 2 seconds of reaction time between junctions, or worse.<br><br>I suppose one way to mitigate this is my <em>Better Furnace Carts</em> idea, which would allow you to slow-down ahead of junctions, so perhaps it wouldn’t be that big a problem.</p>",

The current order is 'Bamboo Planks, Bamboo Mosaic, Bamboo Stairs, Bamboo Mosaic Stairs, Bamboo Slab, Bamboo Mosaic Slab'. I would change it to 'Bamboo Planks, Bamboo Stairs, Bamboo Slab, Bamboo Mosaic, Bamboo Mosaic Stairs, Bamboo Mosaic Slab'. This way, the two are a bit more separated. The current \"overlapping\" layout just confuses me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Secondly, I'd like to see the saturation of the new Block of Bamboo boosted a bit, to match actual bamboo a bit more closely. Not all the way, but a bit.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thirdly, and lastly, now that there's a Block of Stripped Bamboo, I'd change Bamboo Planks to have the same texture as other planks, since the two are currently indistinguishable from the side. I also think slabs and stairs for stripped bamboo (directional, and with the ends visible) would be cool, but that's quite besides the point.&nbsp;<br><br>All in all, I'm really happy with the new update cycle. Keep up the good work!</p>",

The current order is 'Bamboo Planks, Bamboo Mosaic, Bamboo Stairs, Bamboo Mosaic Stairs, Bamboo Slab, Bamboo Mosaic Slab'. I would change it to 'Bamboo Planks, Bamboo Stairs, Bamboo Slab, Bamboo Mosaic, Bamboo Mosaic Stairs, Bamboo Mosaic Slab'. This way, the two are a bit more separated. The current \"overlapping\" layout just confuses me.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><span class=\"bedrock-server\">The 'snowAccumulationHeight' game rule is great! But I'd increase the upper limit to 16 or 32, just for the possibility of some extreme weather over time. I'd also make negative values allow snow to fall on full blocks of snow layers, effectively allowing snow to pile up forever. Obviously not a very practical use, but a fun one.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span class=\"bedrock-server\">Lastly, I think the 'waterSourceConversion' and 'lavaSourceConversion' game rules be dimension-specific, allowing, for example, the Nether to renew lava but not the Overworld. Perhaps an additional field after the true/false for the dimension. If no dimension is specified, it applies the change to all 3, or just the current one.&nbsp;</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span class=\"bedrock-server\">Lastly, I just want to say that this snapshot is amazing. I especially like the explosion-related game rules. I can finally make creepers give me back that wall they blew up!</span></p>",

Netherite to encourage exploration, bastions and brutes as challenge, new beautiful biomes, piglins as nether villagers... I'm hoping that future updates can be just as good, rivalling the best of Minecraft mods. Right now the Deep Dark doesn't have a unique, enticing reward. Recovery compass and music disc feels too much like a novelty collectible and not actually useful like netherite or elytra.

We can't have shiny new equipment, mobs and d1mensions because it's too \"modlike\", but I strongly disagree with that stance. It's necessary to stray from the minecraft vanilla formula to make a better game that remains relevant for decades to come. Minecraft gained a surge of popularity after these modlike changes like update aquatic and raids.</p>\n\n<p>The reasoning for not adding vertic@ s1abs, sh@@rks and @l1igators have always been weak. Limiting creativity? They increase creativity by adding more options, if anything. Teaching kids that these animals are nice? Minecraft shouldn't be a PETA education game, it should stay as a survival game where you do what you gotta do to survive. </p>\n\n<p>This perfectionist stance is holding minecraft back. Hytale is adding all these features that minecraft players have always wanted, and they get praise for it. Mojang will eventually lose to competitors if they're too stubborn with these.</p>\n\n<p>If updates are slow because of lag and bug fixes, then I can understand that.

Creativity is a very rare thing as most players don't know how to make a good-looking house. If players prefer to live in generated structures like castles, or have an NPC build them a good house, please let them. \"One block at a time\" seems like a questionable principle, as instant gratification is what make games fun. Having to google and learn how to build houses is not fun for a lot of players, and it's painfully slow too.</p>\n<p>There's also an issue with furrn1ture in minecraft.

As it is now, I feel the enchantment's uses are pretty limited: dealing with ancient cities, hiding from people in multiplayer, building walls and elevated paths. It would be a whole lot more powerful and a huge QOL improvement to other areas of the game if you could eat and drink and block and aim faster as well rather than just sneaking. I don't know whether I agree about it also affecting crawl speed but I guess I don't really have an opinion.</p>",
