But I thought it was best to start with trying to build a bit of interest in adding a new race to the game.</p>\n<p>In regards to goblins potentially spawning in the Deep Dark, I never took away any impression that the Deep Dark would never get anything other than the Warden; just that the Warden dominates the Deep Dark. I'm looking forward past the introduction of the Deep Dark to suggest some things to enrich the space.</p>\n<p>I posted a comment explaining how I would expect Goblins to be implemented, but that comment was rejected without explanation. Maybe I provided too much specific info that time.</p>\n<p>The core idea of the race is that there would be two separate classes: Common Goblins and Rogue Goblins. The common goblins would always stay in the Dark. You would never see them or they would be very difficult to see. They don't attack the player. They rob the player and make it harder to explore Ancient Cities with impunity.</p>\n<p>Rogue goblins would be more of an adventurer class. They are well armed, travel in bands (similar to pillagers) they can be found above the Deep Dark in caves and very rarely on the surface of the Overworld.</p>\n<p>If these were added, there are many additional things that could be done with them.</p>\n<p>But the Caves don't have any curated hostiles; they're just the same hostiles as everywhere else. Making goblins roam the caves and the Deep would enliven the space.</p>",

As an upkeep requirement in automation of systems, plus could give some very interesting statues.

Everyone has to gather materials though, spend time planting and harvesting in a very repetitive cycle. Now to balance the may require some unique treasure loot from the deep dark or end, however, worth it in most players mind as a reward.&nbsp;</p>",

Having to essentially break the game to farm the enchanted books you want from villagers is really frustrating, it really needs to be reworked to feel more rewarding.<br>The fact that on a server someone always has to be the one that makes a villager trading hall to sell items to everyone else so they don't have to go through the experience themselves says a lot about how fun this part of the game is. When I play on a singleplayer world I dread having to mess with villagers to get the books I want to get a proper \"end game\" loadout.<br><br>There are so many ways for this problem to be fixed. Your idea of villagers changing trades daily seems great. I'm not sure what the broader community would think but basically anything is better than the current state of villager trading and getting the enchantments you want in the game right now.<br><br>I could give so many ideas but I don't think I'd even have the room in this comment to list them all. I think the most important thing here is for Mojang to recognize how badly this area of the game needs to be fixed and get the community's ideas through something similar to the combat snapshots.</p>",
