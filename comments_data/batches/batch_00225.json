So, if this comment is what you are suggesting, please disregard... with the exception of the changing texture based on number of books, which I don't think you mentioned.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What I am envisioning is an empty bookshelf with all wood variants&nbsp;as you describe that has a UI similar to that of the dropper and dispenser (which is the portion that I think is a little unclear).</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;empty bookshelf could have two rows of three empty slots, to correspond to the two \"shelves\" visible on the current bookshelf texture, or maybe it could have three rows of three instead because that UI already exists in the game in the form of droppers and dispensers.</p>\n<p>This is the part I think might be an addition to your post --&gt; The texture of the block could change slightly based on the number of books, enchanted books, or other written books in the bookshelf. That way a library full of books would look different from a library without any books, which could further allow builders to make their builds more detailed and immersive. Minecraft has a few examples of blocks that change texture based on items in the UI, most notably, the texture of brewing stands with and without bottles, and the texture of furnaces showing or not showing flames.</p>\n<p>Finding&nbsp;the random enchanted books in a library&nbsp;as you suggest could be as simple as opening the UI and actually searching through the books&nbsp;in the bookshelf, or breaking the bookshelf with an axe, which would drop all of the books therein.</p>",

However, I was indeed envisioning a texture similar in style to the brewing stand, whereby the textures would be slightly different depending on if the bookshelf has one book, two books, three books, or is empty. By extension, perhaps each slot in naturally generated bookshelves should have a chance to spawn empty, which would vary the look of naturally generated libraries a fair bit.</p>\n<p>The GUI as I imagined it would&nbsp;consist of nothing more than three slots, each of which hold exactly one book. This is simply to parallel the current crafting recipe for bookshelves, and so as to not drastically affect the cost of making a full enchantment setup. I'd be open to arguments in favor of a different GUI - it's not the most crucial&nbsp;component of my post.</p>\n<p>Again, thank you so much for the feedback. I'd very much value this kind of feedback on my other ideas if you happen to have the time.</p>",

But their name does not reflect what they do, and what they&nbsp;potentially COULD do, in our game.&nbsp;<strong>Let's fix this!</strong></em><br><br><strong>Bookshelves should hold and store our books for us!</strong>&nbsp;Like real bookshelves, they beg to be filled with written books! From an EDU point of view, I have seen that children are more interested in writing into their book and quill when they know they have a safe place for them. We can then create libraries in our game, share our stories, and learn from one another. It could be pretty awesome!<br><br><strong>How could we make this change?</strong>&nbsp;It's simple! Our bookshelf doesn't change at all, but when you right-click it, it opens-up an inventory, just like our chests do, but they ONLY accept written books and enchanted books. Yep. It's THAT simple.&nbsp;<br><br><em>My prediction?</em>&nbsp;It would be a&nbsp;game-changer for thousands of kids out there with 'written-output' difficulties. I've seen if first-hand. We have used a plugin on our Vanilla servers (and on some of our earlier modded ones) to encourage children to express themselves and become the story-tellers they never knew they were.

Enchanting Table effects - totally agree with this.&nbsp; if the current configuration is considered the 'base', and any enchanted books placed around the table increases chances from that base point, then this is a great idea!!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

That is a great offer.<br>I would like to mention that there are new types of nether wood. Are there any ideas of textures for them?<br><br>Also there is an important issue concerning the slots for bookshelves: for builders it would be much more tough to fulfil the big amounts of bookshelves with books (imagine, you are building a giant library in survival). Maybe, there should be a variant to craft a full bookshelf, using an empty one and three books (of different types)? <br><br>Also, you should mention that librarians sell bookshelves. Do you want to change this somehow?<br><br>And I didn't get the idea of changing the enchantment mechanics. You want the quantity of books impacts on the probability of multiple enchantments. But do you want the enchantment be somehow customizable with the help of books in the bookshelves? Could you clear it once more, please?</p>",

Bookshelves increase the levels of enchantments you could get out of an enchantment table, which is because the enchantment table is getting information out of those bookshelves (or something among those lines, hence the letters flowing from the bookshelves to the enchantment table). As we all know bookshelves in the current minecraft versions have books laid out in their textures, but if you do change that so that bookshelves can be empty when crafted, it wouldn't look so nice and not realistic as well. My idea here if this gets implemented, is that enchantment tables aren't affected by bookshelves themselves as blocks, but by how many books are in those bookshelves. Example: If you have 15 completely empty bookshelves around an enchantment table (which is the number of bookshelves needed for a level 30 enchantment to appear on an enchantment table in the current minecraft versions) you would only get basic level enchantments (just like the ones you would get without any bookshelves) but as you put more books you would get more advanced enchantments.</p>",

Even if a bookshelf could only store like, 10 books each I'd be satisfied.</p>\n<p>It'd also be useful if the bookshelf ui had the titles/enchantments written directly next to each book. Maybe as a list you scroll down instead of icons in a grid because I always find myself scrambling through chests of enchanted books and having to hover over each book individually when I'm looking for just one enchantment.</p>\n<p>I would be pretty excited if the kinds of enchanted books that are in the shelves affect what enchantments I get at the enchanting table, because currently, I just collect villagers who have enchantments I need and as I progress in the game, I end up using the enchanting table less and less.&nbsp;</p>",

When you link a carriage to a train or a minecart to another minecart, it's actually called coupling.</p>\n<p>This is a great idea, but it goes hand in hand with furnace minecarts that actually work. And a general functioning standard of minecarts where they don't massively bug out. Furnace carts sticking to any other kind of minecart may be enough to save the lot of them, but all three should be streamlined and properly operational or railway engineering in Minecraft is still doomed.</p>\n<p>In real life, the furnace minecart is currently worse than ever. It moves faster, but it propels anything in front of it way ahead like it's a moving pinball bumper, leaving you to wait in your minecart while it slows down and the motorized dummy catches up. And then bounces you 40 blocks ahead again. Yeah, I really like railway stuff, but damn did its Minecraft equivalent get screwed over. I think minecarts just need a complete rewrite with the same intended principles as before and new features like the one suggested here. I would LOVE to ride a convoy of 5 coupled minecart cars across my bridges in the hills.</p>",

I'm not exactly sure if Mojang is adamant about chain armor being an un-craftable item, but if they are flexible with it, it would give the ability to finally create chain armor! As others have also said, the chain may also have the capability to be placed, giving a lot more options to builders in terms of chandeliers, hanging lanterns, creepy settings, etc.</p>",

In the center you have the tripwire hook as the center pin. Maybe sometime down the road it would be cool to connect &amp; disconnect via pin pull, but I'm not asking for that at this time.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">When attached to two carts, the shape folds on the center pin, bending 90 degrees. In essence it acts like a cart that holds no passengers with a quick blip of an animation on turns. The physics of connected carts on rails change slightly to reflect the 'caterpillar' effect as seen with a roller coaster's push, pull &amp; momentum of combined weight; it becomes one pushable/pullable unit.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">For now I would only have the hitch used on minecarts (and their variety.) However down the road, the hitch and chain can both be items to initiate 'free hanging blocks' mechanics. Where 4 long chains can hold a platform of blocks (and swing up to 45 degrees based on interactions) or 2 hinges could be used to make your own 'block door.' That is a far off idea though, for now...it would serve well to connect minecarts.&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\"><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/-1piBUKL18QVcbrq7K-oWw.png\"></p>",

For longer trains, maybe multiple furnaces should be used (or lots of powered rail) with some max train length, say, 32 carts. These trains could also partially load chunks, to keeps it moving out of render distance, for long distance transportation.</p>\n<p>Also, to keep things simple for new players (and not mess up old redstone mechanisms), single minecart physics should be exactly the same. Only for trains, you need wider curves and shallow gradients, which a player can figure out with simple experimenting.</p>\n<p>Finally, for the redstoners, a directional form of powered rail would be helpful, so you can get the train going in the right direction / slow it down more controllably. And perhaps the signal strength of a detector rail could measure speed as well. &nbsp;</p>",

It works similarly to the lead where you can attach it to fences but it will only attach to mine carts and other tripwire hooks on walls. You can connect up to a maximum of five carts total (so using up to four links to connect them, separate from the wall hook).</p>\n\n<p>This would be great with the Minecart Furnace I heard was removed from bedrock edition. Reason is that when the Minecart Furnace was powered it can move by itself supposedly moving other mine carts in front of, and now with the link behind them as well. Example; To make a Train, a minecart furnace can be anywhere in the connection of the five carts to push and pull them along a rail. </p>\n\n<p>I will now elaborate on the idea of breaking the link limit. I mentioned before; using a Powered Minecart Furnace can push an pull carts in front and behind. I am thinking that as long as you have a Minecart Furnace in between 4 carts you could in theory have as many carts being moved by Minecart Furnaces, but I think keeping it at five total carts is fine.</p>",

Using the above approach, I can max out anything I want and give it a custom name as long as I start from scratch, and don't intend to change the name later.</p>",

I’ve been fishing every day for about a week now and I haven’t gotten a mending book. Perhaps allow for an upgraded anvil which allows you to take the cap higher or infinitely. Make it expensive, 7 netherite ingots organized in an I shape. Endgame seems boring because often times you are unable to fix your equipment, my netherite boots were the first to break. They have every enchantment beside mending for boots and when it game time to repair I can no longer do so. In an endgame where I can’t max out seems un fun. Your either hopelessly fishing for mending or not doing anything altogether. Another idea I like is removing the repair growth costs, make it cap at 40 each time you repair. Making it hard but not impossible. Many games allow for a maxed out character and it’s fun cause your OP. <br>TLDR <br>Have a netherite anvil which increases the xp cap or removes the too expensive effects. Perhaps make repairs cap at 40 each time you wish to do so. And that I think is a solution everyone can get behind.</p>",

I agree though it's annoying for sure, and perhaps one way to meet the middle ground would be to make repairing (raw material) and renaming not count against the \"Too Expensive\" cap. It would require some coding I'm sure, however, fixing that epic pickaxe or giving it a new name shouldn't add to the cap at the very least, but be a control on the magical power.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Random enchanting is actually the core issue here in my opinion, now it makes sense when \"learning\" a new spell random chance is perfect sense. However, I think there should be a way to Enchant by choice and if cost more lapis and XP would be perfectly fine. Especially, when you know what sort of armor/tool/weapon you want to build had been lucky enough to get that enchant by random chance before. Whether a new block or perhaps using the updated Bookshelf concept, I'm not sure, but it would give players more control, and make the cap easier to deal with as you aren't burning cap increasing lower level enchants on a favorite tool (protection and unbreaking commonly).</p>\n<p>Another option is the ability to disenchant back into books (a mod using the grinder does exist) allowing the player to anvil upgrade via books and then still apply under the cap going around the RNG.</p>",

I also don't mind how the mechanic works for repairing items, that's not what I'm talking about. It's just trying to get the right combination of enchantments at the right moment that looks absurd to me, I simply don't get the point.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, if you really want it to stay it the way it is, at least make it understandable \"In game\".</p>\n<p>What's the point of grinding XP and trying all combinations at random until it works? Why not explaining how to do it with some sort of guide? Please mind I don't mean some random tutorial, but why not adding an Ancient Tome or Grimoire of some kind that either explains you how to do it legit, or simply lets you do it? It could be an easy treasure to add, expecially with the new Trial Chambers being added to the game.</p>\n<p>The point is to let any player, even someone new to the game, find a way to explore mechanics without needing any exterior tool or resource. You would just get everything you need in the game!</p>",

As for the crafting recipe, it should be the same as a cauldron, except glass panes instead of iron. Reason for panes is so you use less glass. Also, the recipe should include a water bucket in the center, just so you don't have to worry about filling it yourself. You would, of course, get the empty bucket back</p>",

Click with a water bucket to add fish. It would connect to other blocks so you could make it as long and tall as you like, but only one wide. You can just build them in the wall, or have it sit out on a table. Crafting with a skull could give you a little decoration inside.</p>\n<p>This would be so nice for collectors who like to display things, an aspect of the game I think is sadly overlooked.</p>",

Will it help you float to the surface faster and sink slower, or will it not work underwater?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Thirdly how fast will you move with the levitation potion? If you move fast that seems really OP, so i suggest you move sort of slow, for example it could be similar to the speed if you where to be hit by a Shulker. [So kind of&nbsp;slow.]</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And Lastly, [in my opinion] This seems OP in early game, it should be a late game potion you can craft with something that drops from a Shulker, maybe the Shulkers could have a chance of dropping Shulker bullets which can be used to brew it?</strong></p>\n<p>That's all i really got to say about the potion, Its a great idea but needs to be explained some more.

This is an idea that would appeal to myself as someone who found cooking pretty meh.</p>\n<p>I think to make cooking more interesting, and more of an investment, not only should there be a wide variety of bakable/cookable foods, but a tweaked way to create them. Granted, being able to just craft them on a bench make it fun, but also a little superfluous. I'd rather be able to actually have a space to make specialized food.</p>\n<p>To keep food making fun and not tedious on resources, there would be a different kind of furnace powered by redstone, the \"oven.\" It wouldn't be powerful enough to smelt or cook meat to keep balance, and the collection of redstone would make the start of the cooking process special and investable. Plus it'd be a nice, special addition to any chef's kitchen that's actually practical.</p>\n<p>It's only purpose would be to bake and combine foods together, and it's the only station that can. It's how you'd make pies, cakes, stews, and the more complex the bake, the more powerful the food becomes. Eventually, you even have a food item that fills every hunger point with one bite.</p>\n<p>The second kitchen appliance should become the cauldron. It's useless. It has no real purpose. In addition to a holder for water, it can combine wet ingredients together like eggs and milk, to then be combined with dry ingredients and placed in the oven. This kind of process makes a functional kitchen.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To me, making a functional kitchen with cooking mechanics that actually can help makes cooking less superfluous, and worth exploring.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I want to add in I am in full support of implementing rice as said by someone else in here, simply because of the new aquatic update that would allow you to waterlog the rice, just like real rice.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Fruit bushes is interesting, though a little overpowered. There should be a mechanic to it, I believe, just like how crops can be destroyed if you hop on it. For the bushes, friendly mobs could try to eat the fruit off the bushes. So you can't just put it out in the open.</p>",

As of right now, it can be quite a hassle to get to the end, especially if the portal is thousands of blocks away from your base. Also, for something so end-game chorus fruits are pretty useless. Uncooked, they restore barely any hunger, and they teleport you randomly which can be quite annoying, and cooked they’re only used to make purpur blocks and end rods, which, let’s face it, aren’t the prettiest blocks in the game. My idea, is to add a, “Ender Cake.” This cake would be crafted just like a normal cake, but instead of milk there would be dragon breath, instead of eggs there would be Ender pearls, and instead of wheat there would be chorus fruit. This cake, when you take a bite of it, would teleport you straight to the end dimension. This would give chorus fruit a new use, while still fitting with the theme of the item. The cake would restore the same amount of food as a normal cake, but it would have twice as many slices. Finally, not related to food but related to chorus fruit, when cooked they should be able to be used as a purple or magenta dye.</p>",

Minecraft is in need of a new food update as this has been left pretty unexplored.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Foraging in the Overworld</em></strong></p>\n<p>Currently, foraging in Minecraft for food can leave you with a few seeds from broken grass, a small quantity of raw meat, and maybe if you're lucky some crops from a village farm you harvested. In order to keep things interesting, I propose a number of ideas to improve this factor.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Wild vegetables:</strong>Randomly spread across the overworld, these patches of vegetables in clusters of 1-5, appear on patches of hoed land and can be broken with fists as with any other crop. These can be a variety of different items including ‘radishes’, ‘cabbage’, and ‘turnip’ which, when broken, drop 1-3 of the crop and 1-2 of the crop’s seeds. When eaten raw, radish refills 1-3 hunger points, cabbage 2-3, and turnip 1-3. When cooked in a furnace, these become their cooked versions and all restore 3-4 hunger points. Also, when crafted on the ‘kitchen table’ (see later or if not viable to be added then crafting table) with a bowl on the bottom-middle slot, and a radish, turnip, and cabbage in a row in any order above, then it will produce a ‘wild vegetable stew’ that, when consumed, restores 6- 8 hunger points and 1-2 health points.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bushes and fruit trees</strong>: Bushes can spawn around the world and have a similar appearance to that of leaf blocks, but on the ground and in groups of 2-5. Most bushes are normal but 10% bear fruit. Each of these bushes can yield a crop after around 2 minecraft days and visibly have multi-coloured berries on them. They harvest instantly with shears or take 1 second to break by hand, and the bush can be broken in a further 3 seconds with shears; anything else and it will not drop an item. Harvesting a bush gives the user 1-4 ‘wild berries’ which restore 1-2 hunger points each.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Fruit trees are regular oak trees spawning in all biomes that support them, however, unlike a normal oak tree, they can have either red dots ‘apples’, orange dots ‘oranges’, or green dots ‘pears’, on their leaves.

Both are very commonly grown crops across the real world (and also gluten free).</p>\n<p>With Corn, you could probably find it in villages or from breaking grass (as it is a grain like wheat).The crop would be two blocks high and of course, you grow the corn from the broken crops. Corn can be used in a variety of ways, from Popcorn in a furnace, to Cornbread (Two wheat and one corn in the middle, or just three corn) or Corn Tortillas to make Tacos(Recipe would include beef or chicken and probably a carrot). You could even just have grilled corn or Corn on the cob, and use Corn husks(off product of harvesting corn) to make very simple gear (weaker than leather). My Dad had a silly idea to somehow make Fuel from Corn which could open a whole new avenue of engineering, but that is something beyond what I can try to explain here.</p>\n<p>With Rice, It would be found from breaking grass, you would have to make a paddy using waterlogged dirt (with a hoe) and grow it similar to a normal crop, harvesting it with the hoe (Hoe currently only digs dirt and could be used as a tool for reaping crops). The Rice crop can be used to make Rice Porridge (Rice and a bowl), Rice Balls (Rice and a beef or pork filling with dried Kelp at the bottom, based on Japanese Rice balls), Rice cakes (baking rice in a furnace) and Sushi (Rice plus raw fish and possibly dried kelp) to add onto the sushi you may need a Tuna Fish type of Mob or fish you can collect with a fishing rod. You could even add a Pestle type of system to create flours from Rice or Wheat. Rice grass (a possible off-product of Rice farming) could be used to \"weave\" a Mat (similar to carpet).</p>\n<p>I also like the idea of fruit trees and bushes, growing blueberries, raspberries, and a crop that re-grows fruit would be a really nice addition to immersion. I am honestly a hardcore farmer in Minecraft, The more crops, the happier I am.</p>",

Please focus your suggestions on <strong>crops and recipes</strong> vs prepared food. \"Super prepared food\"&nbsp;(we're referring to stuff like pizza) is pretty much where the line is drawn on that.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;Please keep suggestions focused on a single idea per post. <a href=\"/hc/en-us/articles/360003401232-Posting-Guidelines\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360003401232-Posting-Guidelines</a> (lists should be reported via the feedback form, and will be deleted).</p>\n<p>4. Duplicates will be removed. If you're going to start a new&nbsp;Egg suggestion, it needs to be&nbsp;<strong>significantly different</strong>&nbsp;than another&nbsp;Egg suggestion. You also should be original. Don't take other community members hard work from this thread and repurpose it for votes! :)</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",

Dunk it into a cauldron that requires three of the same potion to get the desired effect, or take it to the enchanting table to get an entirely different set of potential effects.</span></p>\n<p><span title=\"DrabbestPrism80\">One effect I quite like is Camouflage. Either adjust the characters contrast to match the surrounding biome, or makes the character slightly transparent. It would also decrease the range you can be detected by mobs.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span title=\"DrabbestPrism80\">In my mind, this Cloak would take the place of your chest armor. With options like double jump, speed, slow fall, possibly a very nerfed constant regen with a ten second delay after taking damage...&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This would make it less overpowered. It would fill every slot except the helmet slot but the cloak has an optional hood that you can pull up. You also have the option to equip or remove the boots section of the cloak in place of boot armour. If the cloak is soaked in invisibility potion, for example, if you’re not wearing the hood, mobs and players can see a floating head. They would still target you. Wearing the hood makes you completely invisible. The same happens with fire resistance. Without the hood, or the cloak covering your feet, if your head or feet touches lava or fire, you take fire damage. Although it would fill up all armour slots, the cloak does not give you additional protection. Wearing it gives you the same defence as wearing no armour. It can be soaked many times but only one potion effect stays on the cloak. There could also be an achievement called ‘I’ll get me cloak’. I hope you like my extra suggestions for this interesting idea. I also hope this makes sense</p>",

You could have many of these blocks if you are a power player but for the average player they may only have a few.</p>\n<p>To do this we thing the crafting recipe should include a Nether Star, specifically our suggestion would be:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/3vg7r9_RYygq3d717r0G_g.png\"></p>\n<p>In addition, the fuel source could be Dragons Breath. This is an item that late game and not so easy to get but is renewable. Dragons Breath isn't used that much typically and giving players another reason to fight the dragon extends gameplay.</p>\n<p>That's our suggestion, but of course a new fuel item could be added if this balance isn't right.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>\n<p>Logic</p>",

For example, you put in 4 planks and 2 sticks and it will know that you want a fence. You could replace the grid with a few item slots and the bench could determine the output automatically. It just outputs the item that uses all the item types and the largest number in those stacks. This would simplify crafting a lot and encourage experimenting over Google-ing the recipe.</p>\n<h3 class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Redstone Problem Solving</h3>\n<p>If the block determines its output automatically, it follows that it could be automatable. When triggered by redstone it could consume one lot of input items and spit out its determined output. Hoppers could fill the input slots and suck items from the output.</p>\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">When trying to create a redstone circuit to automate crafting, players will quickly realize the limitations of the comparator; they only update in intervals of&nbsp;<em>n(maybe 23)</em>&nbsp;items and cannot differentiate between different stacks of items. For example, ensuring the block crafts fences instead of gates would require a very different circuit to crafting trapdoors. They may end up using filter hoppers, redstone clocks, comparators, even binary counters.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Advantages</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>It&nbsp;<strong>simplifies manual crafting for beginners.</strong>\n</li>\n<li>Provides a lot of&nbsp;<strong>redstone puzzles for experienced players.</strong>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Concerns</h3>\n<p>There are some problems however. This system is only applicable to items that are unique when its recipe is converted to shapeless stacks. For example, cobblestone stairs and fences, and a pickaxe and axe require the same number and types of items. The crafting bench cannot determine the output automatically. Therefore I recommend this system only be used for a subset of blocks that avoids duplicate shapeless recipes. It could also be used for purposes other than crafting like alloy smelting, chemistry, etc. For compressing stacks like redstone, coal or wheat into blocks it may only need 1 slot.</p>\n<p>Another problem is that crafting benches let the player preview the item in the output slot. In a furnace, hoppers would suck from the output slot automatically as soon as an item enters it. I suggest that the output slot have a <em>ghostly preview</em> of the item that becomes the normal image when it actually exists. Alternatively, the first item just consumes the input stacks but does not change the image in the output.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">The Assembler</h2>\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">The Assembler consumes items from two input slots and outputs an item when either the output slot is clicked by the player, or the block is triggered by redstone.</p>\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">This block is used to craft simple&nbsp;<em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\">dynamic</em>&nbsp;components. Here is a short list:</p>\n<blockquote class=\"s14dydj4-9 eiPERc\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\"><em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\">chest, trapped chest, dropper, hopper, tnt, lever, pressure plate, button, redstone lamp, note block, rail, gates, trapdoors, redstone torch...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Now, imagine you wanted to craft a chest. You put in 1 plank and it offers you a button. You need to wait for at least 8 planks before you can craft a chest, or you might get 7 buttons and no one wants that. You probably want a filter hopper because if the wrong item enters that second slot, you are crafting nothing. You could cascade 2 assemblers so you can automatically craft hoppers. For that you will need 5 iron ingots and 1 chest. You have to prevent your redstone clock from triggering before 5 ingots because otherwise you are getting iron pressure plates and, again, no one wants that. In this case a comparator doesn't help because its output is 1 at 1 item updates to 2 for 10 items. You will have to count your items in a different way.</p>\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Each recipe introduces a different redstone puzzle. A different redstone circuit may be used to solve each of them. You can still use it manually. So it both simplifies recipes for new players and encourages problem solving for experienced players.</p>\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">I think it should be crafted with a Crafting Bench, 2 Pistons, 2 Comparators and a Stonecutter.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

We could split out the two separately. Create a \"recipe\" item, imprint the recipe you want on to it, and then provide that recipe item to the auto-crafter, similar to how the loom accepts a pattern. The auto-crafter would have one slot for the recipe, 9 for the inventory, one for the fuel, and one for the output. When a recipe is provided, the grid opens up the slots needed for the recipe, and only allows one of the designated item to fill that slot, and then behaves like a normal inventory which accepts hoppers. The items come in left to right, top to bottom, going into the first slot they're allowed.</p>\n<p>The recipes could also serve to add cost to auto-crafting.</p>",

I think the biggest use of this is a massive auto-smelter which takes kelp from an auto-farm and smelts them into dried kelp, then crafts them into dried kelp blocks. The blocks are then divided up into two hopper tunnels: one leading back into the kelp smelter and auto-crafter to fuel them and make more dried kelp, and one that leads to the main smelter for items such as food. I have wanted something like this for a long time, and an auto-crafter would be freaking awesome to make it.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I think, that the \"auto Assembler\" block would be very cool, and wouldn't be too overpowered. Opposed to the OP, my idea doesn't need fuel to operate and would work as normal crafting box. Said item could only work with hoppers, so that's the first cost of making it - you need hoppers. it would have input from any side besides bottom. How to make it not too overpowered? First idea is that it cannot craft stacks. It only crafts items in the same way, as a player would by clicking on the output box in normal crafting box. It could produce output only if powered by redstone, so in the same way as dispenser works. How to make the recipe? You put items as you would in normal crafting box... and here comes the sad part - items you put in are trapped there as part of the recipe. so for a golden pick you have to sacrifice 2 sticks and 3 diax if you want to operate the table. Craft occurs when box is powered with redstone pulse. All the other items that do not match the recipe given in the box, fall through the block without beeing powered by redstone. Another thing to make the block less overpowered: if not enaugh items are supplied, they are all dispensed without crafting, sou you have to make a circuit counting the number of items inserted and make sure, that the box was supplied with them. If too much items are supplied, they pass through. Why isn't it overpowered? first of all, you would need circuits supplying exactly as many items as you want, you would need sorting system and a clock. You will have to make some complicated circuitry + sacrifice some items, so it comes with a cost of space around it + knowledge. Why no fuel? because it would disallow the input-from-side method of recipe items. Also recipes cannot use half used items such as sword with half durability used. Items match to the type, not lore, durability etc., so recipe with 2 full swords would accept 2 swords of for example 1 and 5 uses left. What's more, comparator would be able to output signal from 0-9 telling how many items were supplied till now. A recipe book interface could be reused to implement this, and it would also solve the problem with recipes using same materials with different data ID for example planks.</p>",

How exactly would an assembler block remember the recipes it can hold? Let's say a pro player A already unlocked all the recipes. He creates the Assembler and selects a recipe. Now a n00b player B without recipes comes and picks up the block. Does the block remembers which receipe it had? If so then t requires it's own NBT data and doesn't stack in EQ. If no, then player B places assembler and trades with A to come and set him the receipe. It would also greatly decrease the price you have to pay to make a single assembler. You would have to unlock just one receipe and now forever use it for any assembler you make. Maybe if we used the receipe book item as a blueprint, then it would&nbsp; be easier (for example to \"program\" the assembler we need a receipe book that we put in a slot, and XP? And book has a durability?)</p>\n<p>I think that making the assembler \"lock\" the items to act as a template is a nice way of balancing it. That would make it more of a mid-game block.<br><br></p>\n<p>Also after reconsidering, I changed my mind about mechanism and no-fuel thing. It should act in a similar way a hopper does: accepts only items in the receipe, but each slot can up to a stack of an item, also uses fuel (gunpowder in ratio 1:1 ?) and produces item putting it in an output slot. It emits a signal of strength 0-16 based on the amount of items in output slot. It's top works as hopper, sucking items from container, the side hopper can accept fuel and from bottom side we can pull produced items with hopper.</p>\n<p>I fear that using very high end items such as dragon's breath etc. would make it a very boring and tedious task to obtain the assembler. Personally I would use some kind of piston/hopper/gold(to five it some use already! cmon!) crafting receipe for it.</p>",

In this way all crafting recipes can be used, and an external storage block, i.e a hopper, isn't needed. \n<br />The block would function very similarly to a dropper, requiring a redstone pulse to produce the crafted item and push the output into a container or drop it, just like a dropper.\n<br />The recipe items would have to stay in the grid, so if you were crafting iron blocks you would need to leave nine ingots in the grid and have stacks of iron ingots in the 7 inventory slots. \n<br />It's texture should be similar to that of a dropper or dispenser. When the output is on the side, a 3x3 grid texture is on the top and bottom. When the output is on the top or bottom, the grid texture is displayed on two of the sides, opposite each other.\n<br />It's crafting recipe would require 7 cobblestone, 1 redstone dust and 1 crafting table, laid out in the same way as a dispenser, replacing the bow with a crafting table.\n<br />Somehow I think this is the sort of block that would be exclusive to Bedrock Edition, as it changes the game quite a bit and is also quite overpowered, so it could change the dynamic of the game.</p>",

I personally love this idea and I don't think it's too over powered because you have to have the items for the recipe, the items to be able to craft the end product, and would need a power source (potentially it can be instant or delayed crafting, instant would be balanced by eating up more fuel), and storage for it all. Another way to balance it would be to find a special crafting recipe that would balance it out whether it's intended for early or late game, and there can possibly be an achievement for crafting an auto crafter then crafting auto crafters from an auto crafter called \"well aren't you a crafty one\"</p>",

So if I have 3 blocks together (reactor core) it will produce a damage output of 6 blocks from the immediate area around it. Turn the block into a challenge we never had a “hostile block” if you will and tho so this would be perfect to add it! I’m super into nuclear physics so just the concept of this being into Minecraft is amazing,</p>\n<p>having a block that interacts with the environment will produce players to be more careful when handling this ore, if you have a forest per-say and place down a few radium blocks, this should negatively effect the surrounding area by causing trees and other life (mushrooms) to become irradiated and so forth making sure to put iron around the radiated blocks would be a cool concept.</p>\n<p>I’d also recommend making it more immersive with red stone, using it as a power source but it requires water to stabilize the element in return produces a smoke effect and one’s the chain of reaction is active it produces a very powerful output greater that of red stone.</p>\n<p>I have so many more ideas but these are just some of the top!</p>",

Radium is actually more dangerous than uranium, and is really the stuff of horrors. I'm a huge fan of the End, and I think something&nbsp;<em>akin&nbsp;</em>to radium would work wonders! I think it should be a green fantasy ore though for Minecraft, since it's sort of odd to imagine this stuff of nightmares in the game as just an item. Like radium realistically would give you lethal poison (special effect given to parrots eating cookies, kills everything), withering, slowness, weakness, nausea, blindness, ect ect. I don't think I can get into the details of what happened to people, but it was not pretty. I think \"voidium\" or I suppose \"Endium\" could fit with the End--honestly anything to avoid \"Enderite\" so that it's still a unique name and not confused as a knock-off Netherite. I like the idea in general, and it's crazy to see that this is the only End thing under review, shows how good of an idea it is!</p>",

Minecraft needs a locomotive, again.

Steam will decrease faster with faster speed and incline.</p>\n<p>-Indicator in furnace menu would show how much steam and heat is left.</p>\n<p>-Toggle speed (8x speed), braking and direction (forward/backward) in furnace cart menu.</p>\n<p>-Furnace cart menu can hold 9 buckets of water and 9 sources of fuel; each feeding into their item use slot with water on top and fuel underneath.</p>\n<p>-Bullet trains made from gold instead of iron.</p>\n<p>-Use redstone dust for bullet trains (16x speed) with increased cost in redstone fuel; no freight hauling with redstone bullet trains; only players.</p>\n<p>-Improve cart linking. Link and unlink by button selection.</p>\n<p>-Allow painting furnace cart with dyes.</p>\n<p>-One furnace cart can optimally pull 8 fully loaded carts.</p>\n<p>-Speed decreases by one level going uphill.</p>\n<p>-Two linked and powered furnace carts can pull 16 loaded carts optimally.</p>\n<p>-One speed level penalty for every two fully loaded carts added beyond the original optimizations.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I absolutely agree with this idea.</p>\n<p>Except for only one thing:</p>\n<p><strong>The \"obsolescence\" of the Furnace Minecart.</strong></p>\n<p>Furnace Minecarts should not be transformed into mobile furnaces IMO, instead, mobile furnaces should be their own cart with their own functionality, while restoring and upgrading the functionality of the original (not the buggy) FM. I second @UnlistedMonk on this.</p>\n<p>There's some info in the wiki that seems to make the players that the Furnace Minecart works as intended, or that its current behavior is the result of decisions more than unfixed bugs.</p>\n<p>The Furnace Minecart could coexist perfectly with Powered Rails given the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You could make Minecart Trains given that there is at least one Furnace Minecart in the composition.</li>\n<li>Individual minecarts over Powered Rails move faster than Minecarts pulled (or pushed) by a Furnace Minecart (as a Train). The only interaction Powered Rails and Furnace Minecart/Trains could have is reducing speed reduction when going uphill, but never increasing their max speed beyond the Furnace Minecart limit.</li>\n<li>Also, Minecarts over Powered Rails should move faster than any other transportation method - they are expensive, takes a lot of time and materials to setup, they have fixed route and requires a good reason to set up a (semi) permanent structure, so this justifies that investment - but limited to individual carts with no chunkloading. Designed for player transportation,short distance high-speed cargo (within loaded chunk limits) and contraptions.</li>\n<li>Minecart Trains (with Furnace Minecart) can move as fast as (or a bit faster than) a running horse, significantly slower than the former case, but work well over regular rails (no gold required, it would allow cheaper railways), moving high volumes of cargo (or entities) and have chunkloading. Designed for long range, high volume cargo/passengers and mobile chunkloaders.</li>\n<li>Finally, having more than one option to provide motion power to players who use minecarts should equal to more fun, being you able to choose whatever you need or suits your style, but not making one option obsolete over the other, or even obsolete compared with other transportation systems.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, Minecarts could be upgraded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give the possibility of upgrade standard passenger Minecarts with brakes, and optionally, a way to switch tracks at will without having to descend or stop the cart. Brakes would work on a lone minecart only - minecarts that form part of a train have their brake config overridden by the head (or active) Furnace Minecart. Minecarts with brakes active should not move, even if they are on an incline (not sure what should happen if they collide with other carts though)</li>\n<li>Give the possibility of upgrade standard passenger Minecarts with a sort of speed indicator (in a way that fits the game obviously) so the player could know when the minecart is about to derail.</li>\n<li>(Subject to factibility) Give the possibility to upgrade Minecarts to have torches so they have their own light when travelling at night, and allows them to be seen by other players.</li>\n<li>Use the weight to calculate acceleration and momentum - minecarts with players or cargo should behave differently than empty carts.</li>\n<li>Enable collisions. If a minecart hits a mob when running at max speed, the mob is damaged or even killed (the amount of damage is higher when the cart has cargo or passengers). If the minecart comes to a sudden stop hitting a block (in the end of the line, by example) and hits the block at full speed, the cart reverts to its item form and damages the entity riding it, or drops the items they were carrying. An unpowered track just before the block could be considered as a braking track, therefore avoiding the destruction of the cart. Even more: some blocks, when hit by the cart, destroy themselves (like dirt, sand and logs) and the cart just derails, but the harder ones destroy the cart (like stone, metal blocks, obsidian, etc.)</li>\n<li>Add the Blast Furnace/Smoker cart to allow the player to cook/smelt items while riding on trains.</li>\n<li>Add the Crafting cart to allow the player to craft items while riding on trains.</li>\n<li>Add the Bed cart to allow the player to sleep while riding on trains (spawn point remains unchanged)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, Furnace Minecarts also could be upgraded:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give the Furnace Minecart a GUI that allows placing fuel, set the speed/brakes, lights (if possible), a whistle/bell and a checkbox if they are active or not (active: pushing/pulling, inactive: towed).</li>\n<li>More than one FM can be active to provide extra power, specially with long, heavy trains. In that case, all the brake/speed settings of one FM are the same for all the other active FMs (allows the player to drive the whole train from a single FM GUI).</li>\n<li>When the Furnace Minecart is active and forming a train, its configuration overrides all brake settings of the individual carts. If more than a FM is active, the configuration is the same for all active FMs. The player has to make sure to mark the FM next to his/her cart as active in order to control the cart while travelling.</li>\n<li>Different fuels provide different duration - blaze rods being the most powerful, saplings/canes the least. FMs can be upgraded to accept fuels like Lava and Blaze Rods or capable of handling them from the beginning.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I hope this idea doesn't get ignored. Rail transportation has not received any updates in years. We can also add a better derail mechanic, diagonal rails and longer curves (allow higher speeds and looks cool).</p>",

Some of the things in it are similar to the above comments, but I hadn't read them until now...}</em></p>\n<p><strong class=\"bbc\">Minecart engine</strong>&nbsp;(Replaces \"Minecart with furnace\"):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When crafting, the furnace has to go at the right or left of the cart and will be placed with the 'front' of the engine at that side when placed on the rails.</li>\n<li>Using iron/gold/emerald/diamond in the crafting recipe would increase the top speed.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The engine would be the same height as a fence post.</li>\n<li>I'm also thinking that the model should cover 2 blocks and let you ride in the second one like a cart. Don't know how it would handle corners, but it would look much cooler.</li>\n<li>Starting the engine would work with a click as per a button/leaver or it could start with a direct redstone current (Not power rail or activator rail). It would stop with the same click, running out of track or hitting a block. (If the block is removed it would go again)</li>\n<li>Starting the engine will make the rail under it act like an activated powered rail with slight forward momentum.</li>\n<li>It knows how fast it is travelling and will activate the rail it's over as required to reach 'top speed' (so going up hills will use more or if the cart is going over a powered rail, not use any)</li>\n<li>Each 'rail' it passes over that it has to activate to keep a constant speed uses one unit of fuel per cart in the train.</li>\n<li>The Engine has one 'cell' of storage for fuel as per the current furnace; The fuel will be used as per any furnace smelting, but could also burn TNT for give additional speed boosts when used.</li>\n<li>A setting in the engine could allow for 'hard breaking' (stop as if it it hits a non-active power rail) or 'soft breaking' (just decelerate as a normal cart).</li>\n<li>Placing any cart on the rail behind an engine will start a chain with subsequent carts being able to be added. (No leads required; just set minecarts onto a rail adjoining one that already has a minecart on it and they automatically couple.) Holding one minecart type and click on another already placed to swap them (if minecart containers are empty). Minecarts placed in front of the engine will not couple and be hit by the engine.</li>\n<li>An engine cart added to a chain of other carts will 'end' the train and automatically face the opposite direction. Starting the engine on one end will de-activate the other</li>\n<li>Aesthetically it could produce smoke (per the new 'campfire') when activated. You could also burn fireworks for short speed boost and sparkly smoke.</li>\n<li>You could stand on the engine as it is moving, but acts like any block; can be knocked off.</li>\n<li>A name tag could be used on an engine to place a name plaque on the side of it.</li>\n<li>Using a slime ball and a dye would tint/paint the tender of the engine that colour.</li>\n<li>There would be an internal 'slot' in the engine for items that could be used to modify the engine (perhaps a place for each? Something like the way a beacon works):</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>a light source (eg a torch) it would turn on a front light.</li>\n<li>a sword would increase the damage when it hits a mob</li>\n<li>a pick would mine X when it hit a block at the end (depending on the speed of the cart)</li>\n<li>a slime ball would shunt into other carts without breaking them (and would stop) It would also not damage mobs</li>\n<li>an observer block would automatically start and stop the engine if a player entered/exited a cart on the train.</li>\n<li>a note block would warn if a mob is on the line (and make them get off the line)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong class=\"bbc\">Minecarts:</strong></p>\n<p>Any cart could be colour coded by tinting them with a slime ball and a dye in the crafting table.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">basic cart</em>&nbsp;without a chest in it could store as much as a hopper and the graphic would fill up as entities were placed in it. These would all be ejected at once with an activator rail or by breaking the cart. Detector rails would change output depending on how full the cart is. You can only ride a basic, empty cart. Minecarts hit by an <em>Engine</em> act like they were 'punched' by a player and will break.</li>\n<li>\n<p>A&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">hopper cart</em>&nbsp;placed behind an engine (or another hopper cart) will connect when it's placed and dispense into the cart or engine in front of it. Hoppers in carts could also be updated so that they collect rogue items from blocks adjacent to them like they do from the blocks above them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A regular hopper could connect into an adjacent rail so that it could dispense into any stationary engine/chest/hopper cart.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The dispensing direction of a<em class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;dropper cart</em>, would be determined by the dropper's position next to the cart in the crafting table (no front or rear dispensing); Sides and above would activate the dropper with an activator rail while moving and like a normal one if stationary. If the dispenser is facing down, once activated by an activator rail it would lay stored track on the adjacent block in-front of it until it runs out or it is activated again.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">slime cart</em>&nbsp;could allow block placement on top (and a half-block on the sides). These would move with the cart in the same way that a slime block does on a piston. Each block counts as an additional 'cart' for fuel consumption. Two slime carts could be bridged and count as part of a 'train' even though there would be no minecarts between them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">Note-block cart</em>&nbsp;could make it's sound when it goes over an activation rail.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A<em class=\"bbc\">&nbsp;fence cart</em>&nbsp;could make a cage that would work like a hopper for mobs (same storage and collection). (Perhaps use iron/nether fences for hostile mobs. Only collect non-agro mobs.) This would be the only way to get mobs into carts; running into them with a cart would now cause damage. Could still interact with mobs in cages (creepers blow up, skellys shoot, villagers trade, animals feed but could not breed).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It would be really useful if the&nbsp;<em class=\"bbc\">TNT cart</em>&nbsp;was made useful specifically for creating tunnels specifically for rails/minecarts; if the explosion was directed in a cone forward from the direction of travel. (Or the TNT explosion was set x in-front of the minecart depending on speed of travel when the tracks ended.)</p>\n</li>\n<li>Create a <em>mapping cart </em>by putting a compass in a cart (And/Or the new cartography block?) would add a 'rail network' onto any relevant map for the unbroken length of track the cart is on. (including tracks hidden from a normal 'satalite' view and areas not explored on the map).</li>\n<li>\n<p>Crafting a <em>lit cart&nbsp;</em>with a sea-lantern or glowstone (or other light block) would just produce a light source that could be moved by rail.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With the new&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">aquatic update</strong>&nbsp;it would be also be cool if rails were able to be placed and used under water:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I would make the carts slow down twice as quick while under water.</li>\n<li>Add a new mine cart with a glass block to make a \"bubble cart\" where you can breath underwater if you are in it.</li>\n<li>Mobs have a chance to drown if taken through water, some food items might \"spoil\" or automatically be ejected to float free when a cart containing them enters the water.</li>\n<li>Empty carts could fill with water and have to be emptied/broken (creating a water block) before they could be used again.</li>\n<li>Bubble streams and vortexes could have a chance to separate carts and 'break' trains.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would be cool if a mine-cart could be turned into some sort of cable-car: if&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">mine-tracks could be laid on the underside of blocks</strong>&nbsp;and carts would follow under them. Perhaps you would need to craft some sort of hanging bracket that would accept a mine-cart 'bucket' (This would be amazing in the nether)</p>\n<p>If you ran a rail track into a village, then that village would have a chance to spawn a&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">new villager/trade type</strong>&nbsp;that included all the useful railroad stuff.</p>\n<p>I also think it would be cool aesthetically if we had some of the old 2-man, flat-bed, see-saw, style cart that moved when you pumped the handle up and down... no idea what function it could provide, but it would look cool (esp. in the bad lands)</p>",

Linkable minecarts to create trains</p>\n<p>2.Must use a Furnace minecart to pull trains, otherwise they are too heavy to pull even on powered rails</p>\n<p>3. Trains should push mobs of the track &amp; deal damage.</p>\n<p>4. The top speed of individual carts &amp; trains when combining various fuels &amp; powered rails must be increased to make the cost of railways more worthwhile &amp; travel across vast distances much more tolerable.</p>\n<p>5. The addition of more specialty cart variants like the blast furnace &amp; smoker, &amp; other contraptions frequently needed while mining will make trains more usable.</p>\n<p>6. Update the Rail variants &amp; mechanics. For example: Diagonal rails instead of the right~left~right elbow joint rails, dedicated rail switching mechanics, ect.</p>\n<p>7. Finally, paintable carts for aesthetics &amp; organization of trains/railways.&nbsp;</p>",

(same recipe than Minecart, but diamonds insteal of steel)<br>Diamcart can go much faster than Minecart, and if an entity is hit by a fullspeed diamcart, it is pushed away and get damaged.</p>\n<p>Netherite Minecart (Recipe is Diamon minecart + 1 ingot of netherite)<br>If the Nethercart lands on lava, it doesn't get destroyed.<em> (item form also doesn't fear the lava)</em></p>",

However, I would further suggest that these pearls, given some sort of enchantment procedure such as the enchanting table or smithing with copper, could be expensive but effective throwable weapons which give off various effects to where they are thrown at. For example, throwing one pearl would spawn arrows which shoot out at all surrounding mobs, and another pearl would set everywhere nearby on fire. Still another could ignite and explode all nearby TNT or End Crystals.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Here is my idea fort how custom Paintings would work!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Let’s start off with improving the paintings system that we already have. When you place down a painting, something would pop up on your screen where you can actually choose the size of your painting. This would be so much faster and better for players. Once you choose your size, two options will pop up at the bottom of your screen. These two options are “okay” and “custom”. Pressing okay will just put a random painting just like normal but you choose the size. Pressing custom though would bring up a close up of the painting size that you chose. When this close up happens, you will be able to paint your own painting! This would help players express their creativity in an easy way when they aren’t in creative! When you are in survival though, you can’t make a custom right away. You would first have to craft a paint brush and a paint palette. You would craft a paint brush by placing a feather on top of two sticks in the crafting table. To craft a paint palette you would have to put a bunch of slabs in the crafting table in the shape of a paint palette. If you don’t have these two things, the custom option will be kind of dark and you wouldn’t be able to press on it. If you accidentally break your custom painting, no worries! When making the painting, you can save it to a place called “My Custom Paintings”. You can access this place when in the custom painting close up. Just click on your saved painting, and you will be able to use it! Once finished with your custom painting, you will have the option to name it! If you name it, the name you chose will appear on a little wooden sign underneath your painting. 👍🎨</p>",

I also like the idea of fused frames, but it should be optional so that if you \"use\" one of the paintings, any paintings touching it toggle the fused frames state. I would be fine without the fused frames feature, tho. I think the 4 colors of relevant dye should be part of recipes for paint, and the other component should be eggs, like old-school egg tempera. Paint that is cyan, magenta, yellow, black, and white is stored in the easel.&nbsp; A simplified color selector limits the number of color swatches but is based on a CMYK color wheel. If any paints are running low, the color swatches requiring them are greyed out. Images are limited in resolution to match the 1-tile paintings already available in-game. Canvases should be craftable and are required for a custom painting (4 Sticks and 5 Tall Grass, representing a stretched linen canvas). Once complete, the player gets a Masterpiece item that is similar to a Painting item but only displays the custom image and is the object wherein the image data is stored. Other paintings could behave as usual with regard to changing shape and size and image depending on placement, but when placing them as a 1-tile image, the image they display could also be randomly selected from any Masterpiece in the player’s inventory. If a Masterpiece is ever destroyed, all paintings that use that image would revert to any other random 1-tile image in the default set.</span></p>",

I also think diamond is used because it's a precious stone, and in our imaginary it's easy to think of gems as currency.</p>\n<p>So why add ruby, when diamond works perfectly?! Ruby could provide an alternative to diamond and thus giving players the liberty to customise their currency further <strong>and</strong> without add-ons. We could see rp/smp servers where different people(s) use different currencies. New rp dynamics could appear, for example converting from the one to the other or having currencies that change value over time (which already is the case with diamond, but having ruby will make the dynamic more obvious and complex).</p>\n<p>We can also not make ruby and diamond equivalent, distribution-wise. That could entice players to use both gems for a single economy. If ruby is rarer, it could help big servers to condense their currency if inflation occurs (just look at Hermicraft or real life haha). In order for it to be a good currency, its outside uses should stay limited. A cosmetic use is ok. I say this because I can get frustrated when I need to use <strong>my</strong> currency (diamonds) for armours, tools etc.</p>\n<p>Beyond the nostalig aspect of ruby, its use as currency would be unique (beside diamonds) and add complexity to rp/smp's.</p>",

The wood might be a creamy or peachy colour, but definitely a light colour as we already have two dark coloured woods (spruce and dark oak) and the only current light coloured wood is birch.&nbsp;</p>",

Why would an Azalea tree be made out of logs with the name of another type of tree, which it isn’t?\" I don't think the question can be summed up any more logically. Also they are vastly different trees and 'wood types' in REAL life. Please make this happen. I know we have a new mangrove wood now but still this tree deserves its own wood. </p>",

They stated they don't want to add dying wood or planks because its by design and they want to make us go out and explore to get the new wood types/colors. So why didn't they add an Azalea wood type with a new color back in 1.18? This would have been even more incentive to go out and find Azalea trees and been an extra reward on top of finding a lush cave. The Acacia tree suffered from a similar problem before the community spoke up and Mojang changed the log to a new log. The color doesn't matter much to me as long as its a color of wood we don't already have, more options is always good in a sandbox.</p>",

And there's something awesome about putting together different builds using different wood types: even just from the color, oak feels 'baseline' and suburban to me, spruce feels rustic and maybe medieval, birch feels light and elegant (and because I love birch trees I don't cut it down much so it ends up being rare in my survival builds), acacia feels airy and rich, and jungle feels, well, tropical! Dark oak in particular feels very refined and ancient - it's perfect for a more legendary structure. I have yet to decide how mangrove feels, as I haven't used it much, but it's definitely got a rich color and will surely end up in any swamp biome builds I do - same with mud bricks.</p>\n<p>TL;DR I logged in specifically to see if there was an 'azalea wood' entry and make one if not. It'd be awesome to have another wood variant not only for the different color, but also the <em>feel</em> of the wood - what it lends to its structure in spirit and lore by the color, the means of acquiring it, and the shape of its blocks like doors and trapdoors.</p>\n<p>Note on different pattern: I personally don't think the pattern should be different for azalea wood planks, but I do look forward to the door and trapdoor designs if this is added!</p>",

        "body": "<p>A better idea for a block with a similar function would be a spinner block. It could have an interface that allows you to control the direction, speed, and range of motion. The block could be useful for making working vehicles, windmills, waterwheels, etc. You could even make a dance floor using armour stands (this would utilize the way you can have an armour stand change stance with a varying signal strength, but would actually be able to make them appear to dance, rather than just move their arms and legs). I think it should look like a piston with a roundish head that kinda looks like a pirate ship's steering wheel. This design could also be used for decorative purposes. They should be linkable, and work like sticky pistons in that they use slime blocks to hold multiple blocks together (I also have an idea for a sort of glue that could be use instead of slime blocks; it's in another thread). As far as crafting them goes, I think you should have to put a piston in the middle; sticks in each of the cardinal directions; a piece of Redstone dust, a slime ball, a lever, and a powered rail in the corners (the exact position doesn't matter). The reason for the complicated and expensive recipe is because I do think it would be slightly overpowered in a multiplayer world, because it could potentially be used to set up ingenious (and dangerous) traps, plus it seems like the type of thing that should really only be used when you've amassed a great fortune and have moved on to the decoration and fortification stage, which is always near the end of my time on a world. Of course, it should be free to obtain using commands and creative.</p>",

I had considered possible methods for allowing counter-clockwise and 180 degree rotations such as the input strength of the redstone line.<br>I also considered if it was animated and the block clipped through adjacent blocks, perhaps setting a limitation so only blocks which are unobstructed can be rotated. I didn't like that idea because it greatly limits the applications, but it might make it look less like a glitch. There's always the somewhat cartoony option of making the block shrink somewhat when it's rotated.<br>I also considered if it should rotate once, then stop, or keep rotating while it's powered. Sustained rotation works well with redstone power because greater power could translate to a faster rotation. However, basically every other redstone component will do something and stop, even if it remains powered. So, the rotator should do the same. That's why I think it should be something like 1-5 power = counter-clockwise, 6-10 = 180 deg, and 11-15 = clockwise.</p>",

Their leaves could be harvested with shears to then craft wax using them.&nbsp;The devs did say they were planning to add palm trees eventually anyway so it would&nbsp;give an additional use to them, even if they aren't Carnauba palm trees specifically.</p>\n<p>Woodland Mansions and/or trading are, however, good options to obtain&nbsp;candles&nbsp;as well.</p>\n<p>I think the highlight of this post though is the scented candles and their monster repellent abilities. Their range could be slightly greater than their light level, like a range of 6&nbsp;blocks for one candle, 10 for two, 14 for three, and a maximum of 18&nbsp;for four, preventing any type of monster from spawning within their radius.&nbsp;Scented candles could be crafted with the usual candle components (string + wax) or the candle itself, along with the addition of any kind of flower.</p>\n<p>I've also been thinking about variants of scented candles that could attract certain types of mobs with much greater range, although I'm not sure how those could be crafted. Perhaps they could be exclusive to woodland mansions, giving an&nbsp;additional reason to seek them.</p>\n<p>I really hope that candles get implemented at some point, I'd love to have a more ambient source of light that isn't a redstone torch or locked to a water source.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Regardless of how they are made, this is how baseline candles ought to function. A single candle should have an ambient light level of about 4, which is equivalent to moonlight, and allows monsters to spawn easily. When placed on walls, they sit in a fashion identical to torches and redstone torches. When placed on the ground, they can be grouped together in the same pattern as sea pickles do in water, with a corresponding number of jumps in luminescence from baseline 4 (think cathedrals with all those rows of candles that are lit by people coming to pray). Furthermore, candles could be used to create dim lanterns, which would once again illuminate at a light level of 4, and be useful for allowing monsters to more easily spawn in their dim full-moon equivalent light. I do like the idea of various coloured candles allowing certain monsters to more readily spawn within their light radius, as they could be spread out in dungeons as a sort of crude \"wandering monster table\".</p>",

In survival lots of people roam around looking for better accommodation and eventually when they do find it they struggle to move all their building materials since you cant magically teleport your items there.\n<br />2. Some people dont like staying in one place for very long. Being able to pack up and move at a moment's notice is great.\n<br />3. Finding and taming horses are really hard. Finding saddles for them are even harder and dont get me started about breeding. The cart gives transport to 7 people. Thats amazing. And the fact that it has durability doesnt make it that op, I guess? </p>\n\n<p>That has been my suggestion to this suggestion and it would be great if it gets implemented maybe in 1.15 since its most likely going to be a v2 of the combat update,this could help with PRP(Player raid player). </p>",
