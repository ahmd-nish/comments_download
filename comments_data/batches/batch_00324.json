I think the gold golems should be aggroed towards basically anything that aggros piglins, not wearing gold, attacking a nearby gold golem or piglin, opening or mining a storage unit, or mining gold. I think they should also aggro towards wither skeletons/withers which will also aggro back. Also iron and snow golems should attack gold golems because gold golems are technically hostile/neutral mobs. I also think you should be able to plant piglin pumpkin seeds in soul soil.</p>",

Perhaps an armor with plus 2 armor toughness compared to the plus 1 armor toughness netherite offers over diamond, but no knockback resistance? This set of armor is still obtained by a diamond piece plus another upgrade item. Perhaps add different netherite scrap-gold ingot ratios? higher gold ratios increases pickaxe mining speed but gives not as much durability buff?</p>",
