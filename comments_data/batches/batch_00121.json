For example one could find a lone broken tower on some tall mountain, an old fort now infested with mobs (e.g: spawners) in a forest, an abandoned farmhouse with some distended fields around it, a nicer/updated mineshaft with a proper entrance, or a natural grove with a pond and some magical feature - which could be explored for brewing or other items- or could be home to some new creature like peaceful plant-lings (or the glare or moobloom); a old mechanical workshop/forge to find a rare copper golem... The ideas are literally endless to making structures, but when it comes to current Overworld building features, there aren't many, and the ones we have are old or repetetive. Having a more \"lived in - yet abandoned\" feeling for minecraft would make exploration way more interesting, and add to the lore of being the lone survivor who shapes the world to his or her whim.</p>",

Unless we have unique blocks, mobs, and biomes to keep our attention occupied we won't bother. Just look at a screenshot, because obsidian is annoying as heck to mine.</p>\n\n<p>Not saying I hate this idea. I would just like it fleshed out a bit more. I actually really really like this idea. Minecraft needs more dimensions and to reinstall that sense of adventure back into us. The Nether update is good, but I think great ideas like THIS need to be brought to the game. You got a vote from me pal~!</p>",
