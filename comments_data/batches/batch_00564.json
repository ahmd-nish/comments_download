I think the best way to craft this in bedrock and java would be three of any kind of striped log in a diagonal form the crafting bench. If you were to add a chest I should be in the middle of the boat with the first player that enters the boat in the back and the second in the front. On a side note the paddles should look at least a little different from the regular boat, maybe a more thin paddle and longer shaft. I hope this helped your decision on this topic and I hope to see it in the near future.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>Burning copper would imply oxidizing it further. I think the word you're looking for is 'melt' or re-smelt which would heat the metal to the point where oxygen gas is expelled from the lattice. I would love to see flint and steel used to further oxidize blocks since burning it would cause a chemical reaction (combustion) to bind the metal to oxygen. To stop combustion and corrosion from occurring, wax is already used in the game. This is already a great mechanic because a wax coating doesn't allow for oxygen to react (either corrosion or combustion) with the metal. The upside to adding a burning mechanic is not having to wait as long for blocks to corrode and it gives another use to flint and steel or other fire starters. Plus it balances the game by allowing for corrosion to be halted, reversed, and (now) furthered. Corrosion also occurs faster in aqueous environments (unless treated like in the case of wax) so it'd also be cool to see that reflected in the game, but that's not a detail I'm concerned with. (Gameplay wise: untreated copper blocks should be activated with flint and steel to cause a fire and further 1 oxidation level. Treated blocks cannot be activated by flint and steel, but the axe can remove the wax and oxidation can start. Another idea: setting the metal on fire could increase the chance for oxidation and lower the necessary time for oxidation to whatever seems fair.)</p>",
