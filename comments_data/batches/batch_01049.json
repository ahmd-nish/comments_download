        "body": "<p>(From the person who posted this)</p>\n<p>This is my idea on how it would work, but I recognize theirs probably a better idea out there. There should probably be something about bringing a mob from that biome to the new one, but that wouldn't make sense all the time. Perhaps there would be something else that must be done too, or maybe it takes a couple days. However its done, I think it should be implemented.</p>\n<p>Just too add further clarification here's some more examples.</p>\n<p>-Pale garden; grow at least five pale oak trees. Destroy any other trees, flowers, or underbrush. Place a reasonable amount of pale moss blocks and pale moss carpet. Place plenty of eyeblossoms. The amount of pale moss necessary depends on how many trees you grew. Now the next day the sky will be grey, the grass will be desaturated, and no mobs will spawn there during day! (this was posted while the pale gardens was under development so this might get dated)</p>\n<p>-Mushroom island; replace all grass with mycelium and destroy everything in your chosen area. Than grow at least five giant mushrooms, and the next day mushroom cows will spawn and nothing else in that area.</p>\n<p>Obviously there are some other things that should be talked about, what about underground biomes, nether biomes, and end biomes? I think these should probably only be treatable in the proper place. It would be cool to create a warped forest in the overworld and get naturally spawning endermen all the time. But it would be overpowered.</p>",
