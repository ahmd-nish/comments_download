SOMETHING has to be done to promote exploring, and this could be it. Content could be selected in a \"Best of Submissions\" contest that runs monthly. This content could include buildings, cities, caves, events, or mini-games even.</p>\n<p>Minecraft could be a game that stay relevant for generations, but only IF something is done to keep it interesting. Right now, once you killed the Ender Dragon the game gets boring, and I will NOT buy content from your market, it is TOO expansive. $5 for a virtual piece of clothing? Also, the content on the store is kind of useless, we want to add features to OUR worlds not use whatever world is supplied with the add-ons.</p>",
