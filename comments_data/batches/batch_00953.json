I think this would work like gold armor and piglins, if you wear gold armor the piglins are neutral unless proveked in some reason, but other mobs still attack if you are wearing gold armor. So if you were to wear a skeleton head, then skeletons would not attack you unless provoked, but other mobs still would. This way it would not be too overpowered, because if wearing one mob head would make you invisible to all mobs this would be WAY too overpowered but simply removing the threat of one mob type such as skeletons you would still be threatened by other mobs. This would also work kind of like wearing a pumpkin head so that endermen don't attack. Also, if more mob heads are added, hopefully, this would give more reason to try to get them. And while a ghast head drop seems strange it would be great to have the ability to walk through the nether waste and not be afraid of being attacked by those nasty creatures, maybe the head would also block out their awfull screeching😣.</p>",

Maybe even you entchant it with some \"camouflage to anthropots\"- thing, that ALLWAYS (even with Trading) comes with \"course of vanishing\". That way hunnting Mobheads becomes almost like a profession and buildings Farms for that purpose would make sence lore-wise, while also moving that type of mob you still need to be carfull for the other types ob hostile mobs.

But piglins could be different to where they get heavily offended if the player wears the head of their fallen ancestors, calling upon a piglin raid if even just one piggy that spots you with it on. Stick to gold fellas!! But if hostile mobs other than piglins are already attacking you, equipping their heads will do nothing because you’ve then been spotted at that point. Warden’s wouldn’t care regardless and still attack. Wither skeleton and wither boss could be a combo package for wither skeleton heads, mainly because the player would eventually have to defeat it anyways(unless they just love pure chaos). Hostile ender creatures will seise attack and respect you when player equips the ender dragon head with elytra wings. Futher attacks against ender mobs will cause them to attack again until the player find the time to manually place the dragon head back on. Getting creeper heads would save a lot of grief. Apply a nautilus shell to a zombie head to get its head or get it out of water at night and get next to a charger creeper. Skeleton heads can be changed to wither skeleton heads with a wither rose. Wither skeleton heads can be changed to skeleton heads with lighting strike and on rare occasions summon a wither army. Skeleton heads struck by lightning could summon a melee skeleton that moves faster.</p>",
