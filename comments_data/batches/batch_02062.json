It is suddenly barely worth it to do villagers again and I do think there needs to be some changes to how villagers work they were already tedious and frustrating to set up. It takes a solid eight plus house to set up a villager breeding set up and a whole trading hall. The average person can probably do that in a week but that is a whole week of game play already. This new update changes it so armorers are not worth it and it will take so many hours to set up a system to work. <strong>This new system does</strong> <strong>not account for poor world generation</strong>. If you do not have a swamp for 5000 blocks (like exists in a realm I play with my friends) you essentially cannot access mending unless you have the time to transport a villager 5000 blocks and then back. I love minecraft I really do but I do not like this fix at all. It does not feel realistic for most of minecraft's demographic. A suggestion I saw and that I liked was making the plains villager a jack of all trades, master of none where they offer all trades but at a low level, ie protection 2 instead of 3 and make it so they are unable to get to that high level. They are still able to offer mending but they could change the way probability to make it harder to get mending specifically if that is what they are worried about.</p>",
