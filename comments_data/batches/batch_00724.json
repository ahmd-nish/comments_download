There's no unique drop to cause someone to seek them out yet (I imagine the goat horn will change this when it's finished) but they also don't provide any food. Like you said, as of right now they serve no purpose besides aesthetics and all of these changes are great potential solutions. I actually wouldn't mind them becoming the most valuable passive mob over cows since they can only be found in mountains where as cows spawn nearly everywhere. Plus mutton is inherently less valuable than cooked beef so it balances out pretty well.</p>",

The example you give is not relevant because you're talking about biomes, which are totally different gameplay aspects to building blocks. They're not hesitant to push away content that needs more attention or polish, as we've seen from the Bundles being pushed to 1.18 and Archeology as a whole being pushed from Caves &amp; Cliffs despite them promising that it would be part of it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not blaming the devs. I'm just saying that they won't release any features if they are not ready. Besides, 1.17 adds very little to exploration. 1.18 is the part that most people are excited for because it would add all of the new mining strategy, the new cave generation, the biomes, and the Deep Dark as a whole. I don't think the charm of the update would break once we get the first part, unless you only play for the building blocks. However, I do see where you're coming from.</p>",

The developers work so hard on the game, and it is not their fault if the game is not as popular. All games have a time where they are no longer played as much, and this could be just due to people eventually having enough from the game. Minecraft is a game with infinite possibilities. If you think for one minute, you'll find thousands of activities to do regardless of the version you're playing, and yet people, including me, get bored from time to time, and you shouldn't ever blame the developers for that. Also, not everything the community collectively wants is necessarily good for the game. The community collectively voted for Phantoms, even though the developers stated that it's a mob that punishes you for not sleeping, and look where we are now. Certain things, like Mushroom caves, might seem very easy to add, but in fact they probably take almost as much resources and time as any other biome that is added. The developers have their own vision, and if they added all the features that satisfy the players, Minecraft could have gone horribly astray. Everything they add needs to be carefully calculated so that it doesn't mess up their design goals. They have stated that they want the caves to feel very special, not just a copy of what is above ground. That's why there are not really any trees in Lush Caves, and they're not planning on adding them, because then it would&nbsp; just be a forest underground.</span></p>",

I might be strict for saying this, but a game not performing well is definitely the developer's fault.</p>\n<p>I'm not going to be mean to the developers, though. They've done such an amazing job keeping the community alive with big updates lately. Exciting battles in raids, improvements on lacking areas like oceans and nether, scary Warden mob! I'm grateful for the free updates, and I'll even support them further in microtransactions. All I'm saying is that I encourage them to keep it that way, and not be stagnant like before. Games will not be played as much anymore if updates stop. But with huge, daring updates that the community enjoys, Minecraft can truly be a timeless game. I don't mind if Minecraft goes astray, if it will turn out even better than before. Of course, bug fixes are also important, I'd hate to see my world corrupted!</p>\n<p>Regarding the Phantom, it's not necessarily what the community wants, rather, it's a forced vote for something still relatively unknown. If they could have a say in what they want, they'd all be voting for a cave update.

Sure, you can blame the developers for that, but you cannot call them stagnant. By the way, sure, the community cannot have a say for what they want, as proven by the Feedback website that I'm writing on right now and that has thousands of suggestions and nearly millions of comments, and by the fact that the Caves &amp; Cliffs update is becoming objectively one of the biggest updates that have ever happened. You'd figure the fact that the developers are updating the game more than annually would be enough for a happy and kind community, but apparently it's not. So for once, stop blaming the developers for the fate of the game. They're not super heroes. They have&nbsp;<strong>lives&nbsp;</strong>(I know, insane). They make mistakes and <strong>learn</strong>. The developers have always been working hard, and have always been passionate about this game, yet people only recognize that (barely) when things go well. If things go badly, then people call the developers stagnant. They can only do so much with one update, they try to please everyone; result: they get hate comments.

When you criticize an update, also say how you think it could've gone better. A bad update is not there because the developers were lazy, it's there because they still had a lot to learn about game development. I'm not blindly praising them, I'm just acknowledging that they always try to do their best to improve the game. Of course, 1.9 was a mistake, and so where a lot of things, but instead of just saying \"the developers were stagnant\", I acknowledge that the developer's did work hard (1.9 was really big, they did a lot within it), and try to understand what went wrong and how it could be fixed. Jeb is now working on another update to combat, as you probably know. The developers themselves acknowledge when things have gone terribly, which to me indicates that they are really passionate about the game. Criticizing is okay, but when you say stagnant you're criticizing the developers themselves rather than criticizing their work, if that makes sense.</p>",

        "body": "<p>@Ziad El-Moursy\n<br />The word \"stagnancy\" is not a personal attack. It's a criticism of Mojang's work in that updates became too stale in the past. I've mentioned how it could've gone better, which is what they're doing now: exciting battles in raids, updates on lacking areas like oceans/nether, new combat-related content (netherite, bastions, brutes) as well as building content (chains, lanterns, sculk). Something that excites the community like the Warden, which is sure to generate tons of youtube reaction vids. </p>\n\n<p>Back then, updates did not excite players enough for them to come back and play again. And many would agree with it. Again, there is irrefutable evidence that Minecraft was unfortunately stagnant at one point, look it up. But thankfully, things are getting better, and all I'm saying is that I encourage them to continue to do so.</p>",
