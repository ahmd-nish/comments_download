The potions looked so much cooler with the enchantment glint and currently we have no way to make any item have the enchantment glint by default, this feature is hardcoded. There should either be an accessibility option specifically for the enchantment glint on potions or there should be a way to customise this with resource packs. Note that not all types of potions had the enchantment glint, the normal glass bottles and awkward potions etc. didn't display the enchantment glint. It feels also inconsistent that potions don't display it anymore, while experience bottles still do. Experience bottles can be thrown the same way as splash potions and lingering potions. I understand, that the glint made it harder to distinguish them but that wasn't that big of an issue for me. I was still able to distinguish them when I needed to.&nbsp;<br>Instead of making this a simple toggle, maybe make this a slider that is like the Glint Strength accessibiltiy option but only applies for the potions. That way you could only partially have the enchantment glint if you like it while still wanting to have it easier to distinguish the potions.</p>",

Several players I've seen, even if it's smaller than the more welcoming players to the changes, would still like the original look of the potions, either for personal preference or other purposes.<br><br>Proposed changes:<br>- New Accessibility Settings: Potion Enchantment Glint -&gt; [On/Off]<br>- New Accessibility Settings: Potion Colors -&gt; [Default/Old/Red-Green Colorblind/Blue-Yellow Colorbind]<br>(I added colorblind changes for players who are colorblind since removing the glint in the first place made it harder for some colorblind people to distinguish them easily from other bottled items. The new potion colors should still be default since you are committing to this change, and make the old settings an option.)\"<br><br>Overall, these settings could benefit more from the \"Quality of Life\" aspect of the update and 1.19.4 and future versions of bedrock, especially for players who still want the old potion settings.</p>",
