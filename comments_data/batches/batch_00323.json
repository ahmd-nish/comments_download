It would be cool to see warped sand on the ground, like the gravel traps that generates between some nether islands. The upside-down feel of this block would pair well with things generating on the nether roof. The structures would be fun to explore. The Warped sandstone would give us three primary colored sand bricks. I like how the Gravitational block is expensive for newer players.</p>\n<p>The Eh: If people could bring warped sand to the overworld, that would be an easy way of creating problems with the entities, same with the Gravitational block. I don't know what the texture of the block would be, but I don't think it should be as bright as the warped fungus trees.</p>\n<p>Suggestions: Maybe warped sand would only work in the Nether? Gravitational Blocks would only move fluidly for 12 blocks and then have to be updated in some way until it reaches the 256 height limit? That would allow for more complicated redstone than just all the way up and all the way down.</p>\n<p>Overall I like everything about this idea, but sand falling up in the overworld might have some issues.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

We never have just a single world everyone works on together.</p>\n<p>The stipulation I believe would be good would be that it only connects between worlds that have access to Achievements. (Since, obviously if achievements are disabled, just use Creative Mode and get whatever you want.)</p>\n<p>Thus, since you have to reach the End in the first place, it's not like there is anything in the way of \"progression\" left. (Other than reaching the Nether and then the End, there isn't any kind of progression in this game). So why not at least let <em>some</em> players (like me) not totally hate starting over and over and over with nothing to show for their past worlds? Especially since the Dragon Egg is a unique item it is very much a limited situation if the chest will even exist in that world.</p>\n<p>Obviously, it shouldn't connect to Creative worlds, Cheat-enabled worlds, or modded&nbsp; worlds (I just assume modded worlds could have an issue, if not then take it off the list).</p>\n<p>Can I imagine there is a way people could manage to get \"too many\" of some items this way? Yes. Do I care about that? Of course not. I'm not a \"work for every little thing the RIGHT way\" gatekeeper, I'm a gamer who would begin to enjoy this game a bit more again if it didn't feel like such a colossal waste of time starting over so often just to play with friends, which, for me, is the whole point: playing, and having fun, with friends.</p>",
