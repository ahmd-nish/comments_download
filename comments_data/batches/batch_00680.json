Spruce leaves have this dark green color. This means that both types are mostly immune to biome color. \n<br />If by \"color of the leaves is difficult to understand\" you didn't mean that I did not make the case clear, your answer is about 30 words earlier. If you meant that you cannot describe it well enough, then I may just say that some leaves with somewhat golden-lime tint, that would be partly effected by biome colors, would be interesting.</p>\n\n<p>Don't get this as destructive criticism, it's meant to be constructive one, but I'm writing this a little late.

You could get blank discs the natural way, by skeletons shooting creepers. They would get normal discs too, with the music already on them, but have a chance of dropping a blank disc. Or maybe you could overwrite a disc using the music box. But basically, the music box would record whatever sounds were made around it, so you could set up a note block song around a music box, and record it playing, and then take the disc and play it in a regular (portable) jukebox! You have to be careful when recording, though, because you don't want to capture footsteps or block noises. I think that would be great!</p>",

While jukeboxes are in fact portable, if you walk too far away from them you can't hear the music anymore. The idea of this is music that you could carry with you. But that is a great idea! There is a chance I'll use that idea to help improve the original thought.I am thinking about changing it so that when you open it it captures any sounds made and not just music making devices.
