But I do notice Microsoft sorta pushing Bedrock Edition into becoming the official. Combining Java and Bedrock might be kinda bad considering that Bedrock edition has micro-transactions unlike Java Edition. And if you wanted a custom-shaped head for your skin, you'd be able to do that for free, while in Bedrock paying is encouraged.<br>And yes you can still make your own skin in Bedrock, but I don't like the idea of leaving animated (overall better) skins behind a Pay-Wall.<br>If Java and Bedrock Edition were to be combined, I think the micro-transaction system should be removed, and instead the achievements/advancements would give you Minecoins to get preset maps or the ability to animate skins. (The minecoins+achievements idea probably an already-existing suggestion somewhere on here)<br>Otherwise the kinda bad reputation of Bedrock would just spread to Java.<br>(I don't really mind the idea of Realms though cus I never use it on either versions)</p>",
