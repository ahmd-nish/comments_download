It would be passive unless you attacked any other passive mob in its territory, when it would turn aggressive and track you down, acting like an Iron Golem guardian of the forest. It would alert you that it is coming for you with some sort of bellow/scream, like when you make eye contact with an enderman. There would be a skin variation who would be white, the Yeti.</p>",

        "body": "<p>This is a great idea. The phantom as it works now is counter to all the other mechanics in survival minecraft. It is a mechanic that encourages you to skip the night. It is trying to force you into playing peaceful and interact with mobs only via safe farms. <br><br>I suggest that the phantom should do the opposite. A phantom should have a chance to spawn after a number of nights has passed. The phantom will only attack the player if they are sleeping. The phantom doesn't do much damage itself but it does wake the player up. This is only a problem if the player is sleeping out in the open or if there is an easy way for mobs to get close to the player. If the player is sleeping in a well defended base they just kill the phantom and go back to sleep. If not, the time it takes to kill the phantom will allow mobs to spawn. If the player is awake at night anyway the phantom is just one more mob to kill.<br><br>This idea is a call back to when mobs had a chance to wake the player up. It encourages the player to defend their bed and build defensive structures like lava moats etc. It means skipping the night does not break the game but in a way that is not too punishing. This adds back something that has been lost from the game over the years.

Maybe have phantoms do a charge attack and have it be more at ground level when homing in on the player, so the player can hit it. Now, it behaves like the old Ender Dragon. Even if you hit a Phantom, it escapes and you only hit it once, making it extra annoying. Maybe when you get hit by it, you are temporarily stunned instead of doing knockback so you don't get knocked off, and make phantom membrane make a hallucination potion or item that gives the effect (keeping slow falling) which adds a new combat mechanic. Good idea.</p>",

Insomnia cannot be cured by milk and forces the player to stay up.&nbsp; Insomnia should last longer based on the difficulty.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Easy: 1 day</li>\n<li>Normal: 2 days</li>\n<li>Hard: 4 days</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To stop players from sleeping before the phantoms spawn they should have nightmares. Every sunset there is a chance that phantoms will spawn during the night. If the player sleeps before phantoms spawn they will have a nightmare. Imagine this:</p>\n<p><em>Where am I, I look around and see nothing but a perfectly flat grey plane shrouded by fog, I check my inventory but I have nothing... I punch the bleak ground below me but it doesn't crack, I hear a terrible shriek! Phantoms swoop towards me! I run. I must keep running! Is that... A portal? I escape through the portal and look around, I am in my house. In my bed... And then I hear the terrible shriek. The phantoms are here...</em></p>\n<p>This will cause players to have to fight the phantoms. This is good because it allows them to be challenged by the night, instead of hiding in their huts.</p>",
