But this improved when mangrove swamps, mud bricks and frog was added. Even though they were small changed , it felt somewhat like the wild update.</p>\n<p>To me the wild update always meant new trees fauna and dynamic diversity in biomes. Addition of pre -historic/ancient trees that are rare to find in deep forests is a concept i would like to see implemented. A great example is the Banyan tree, its sheer scale would give players goosebumps upon stumbling. It could have suspicious sand and gravel scattered around it or any new mechanic corresponding to exploration. It would not regrow since its ancient. The banyan would be a really cool addition if its scale is same as irl.</p>\n<p>Same with jungles. Please make variety in jungles like the bamboo forest patches.&nbsp; Deep canopy jungles with massive trees of several types and not just a single type. Make the jungle mysterious and overgrown and add variety like small twisting rivers with packed mud river beds. The jungle would feel like a different place seperated from the world.</p>",
