It seems around every corner is copper which is basically 100% useless which I wouldn’t mind if it didn’t feel like it is just taking up the space for coal and iron. My wife and I are playing through Minecraft and this is her first time and I feel bad because we have to resource guard coal and iron like mad men especially being so late in the game to and still we having to scrimp and save for coal and we are even still having to make charcoal! With how many hours of game play we are at I’d normally be going into the nether and and be working on full diamond equipment but this go around we have chests full of copper ore and barely can start to afford a full iron setup. </p>",

        "body": "<p>I think a simple solution would be to add more uses for copper for regular players. Don't get me wrong, it's a beautiful building block, but for non-builders such as myself it is somewhat useless. Honestly, Mojang just needs to dedicate an update to solidifying copper as a necessary ore/material in the game. It may not sound the most interesting or diverse update to the game, but without it I think copper won't be considered essential.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think they should add copper tools and armor, it could replace iron and have 250 durability and also be used to mine iron, lapis, nether gold, and nether quartz ore; then iron tools/armor can be upgraded to have 800 or 900 durability to bridge the tool progression gap towards diamond, keeping the ability to then mine diamond, emerald, gold, and redstone ores, though of course stone would lose the ability to mine iron and lapis ore to maintain the progression (stone -&gt; copper -&gt; iron -&gt; diamond). Mojang could utilize the oxidization of copper to make a very unique toolset, like they become more brittle but toughen up, allowing oxidized copper pickaxes to mine diamond and redstone ores at a slower speed or decreasing attack speed but increasing damage (but critical hits with an oxidized copper sword will use more durability). Another feature could be enchantability with a fresh copper tool is closer to gold, but oxidized copper is closer to iron. Idk, seems like a missed opportunity to not have copper tools/armor in the game.</p>",

I don't know all what they could add in this regard, but I saw some concept art with a copper fan block blowing air; this would have fit right in with the trial chambers and would be a fascinating new redstone block/mechanic. The copper golem also sounded interesting, but I didn't vote for it because I didn't like the randomization of it; if there was a way to control them or control the order/timing of copper buttons they pressed I think they'd be a great addition to automated redstone. The randomization could be great for flickering lights, but I'd like some method of control to choose between random button mashing and a fine-tuned automatic machine. Copper rails would be great, but an improvement to minecart/rail transportation mechanics is a completely different tangent.</p>",
