(It would be cool to have a hostile mob that is tameable). Also would like the skeleton wolf to be classified as undead (so it is healed by potions of harming and harmed by potions of healing) while also being immune to sunlight and able to walk/run on the ocean floor (or underwater in general) the way skeleton horses are.</p>\n\n<p>Would also want a wither skeleton wolf variant. I think it could be created by breeding 2 skeleton wolves in a nether fortress (this would make it hard to get and fun for people who like collecting rare mobs like the brown mushroom and rare blue+orange axolotl). The wither skeleton dog would give the wither effect to stuff it attacks (like the wither skeleton does) and would be immune to fire and lava damage because it is a nether mob. I feel like those two features would make wither skeleton dogs very desirable for players who love combat or pvp because the wither effect and immunity to burning would make them tough and better fighting companions then regular wolves.</p>",

I'm all for hyaenidae representation, but reskinning a canine as a hyena is spreading more misinformation that people have been trying to debunk forever now. I think it also puts a negative light on Mojang, making them appear as though they're lazy or don't do enough research. Anyways, good luck!</p>",
