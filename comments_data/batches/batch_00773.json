Large bodies of water in the Deep Dark would be a very uncommon sight for most players, making the chances of encountering such a enemy extremely low.</p>\n<p>But if one did, the effects would be disastrous and completely kill the fun one is having playing the game. Taking control away from a player is not a fun mechanic in almost every case. And could cause great frustration and difficulty with interacting with the games other mechanics. Especially with such a tedious and difficult \"cure\" functionality. Simply dying is not a viable option for the hardcore player base. Golems only naturally spawn in villages, which could be hundreds of blocks away. Either walking hundreds of blocks or trying to gather the resources to build a Golem while the Leech augments your controls and inputs would be, for rather obvious reasons, tedious and completely unfun.</p>\n<p>It's drops also seem underwhelming for the great tedium and harshness of dealing with the mob. A splash potion like effect that makes mobs run away from a particular area would have very limited use in most gameplay scenarios, and is vastly obsolete when compared to other options already offered by the game.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I highly suggest rethinking how this mob and its mechanics would appear and function in game. I do not wish to discourage you! Nobody gets things right the first time after all!</p>",

There are mostly smooth. I’m missing some more stony sections, with a bit higher local noise level. I like sandstone as building block. Currently the only place to get bigger amount of sandstone are some of sockets of the pyramids. But also, these are back to a reasonable size in the 4<sup>th</sup> snapshot.

If you want to test out all the new functionality available mining can get stressful. In general mining is more time consuming. You must go to different levels to find the ores. Iron is always short in all phases of the game, but there is sufficient iron available if the player does know, where to search.</p>\n<p>I do not recommend increasing iron availability above the 4<sup>th</sup> snapshot. Instead I would give cupper more use cases where it makes sense. I propose to have alternative recipes for buckets, cauldrons, hoppers and bars. Where iron gets replaced by cupper. This would not have a big impact on the game mechanics but reduce the shortage of iron a bit. Iron cauldrons, hoppers and bars would have the same functionality but should have their unique look</p>",

Is it that hard to literally sneak?! Let the developers implement the gameplay they're aiming for without spamming them with ideas they said 90% of the time that they won't do. That tweet Kingbdogz said back in February was more than overwritten by everything else he said afterwards. The reason he was considering an item that lets you go past the Warden without stealthing was because he buffed the Warden so much to the point that he was pondering if it would be too overboard/scary for players (he said so). Plus, he mentioned an EXTREMELY late game item (not a gOaT hOrN or EnChAnTmEnT). Nobody thinks too scary should be a concern, according to almost all of the replies he got.</span></p>",

The criticizm around the idea of Warden drops is that it incentivizes killing the Warden and defeats its design, and they seem to have been getting stronger on that stance overtime. Quite a few replies from Kingbdogz confirm that Mojang is firm on making the Warden a disaster that you stealth around; it's not going to be a combat situation (to quote one of his replies). So having valuable drops for it (or from minions that spawn when it is killed) is really not a debate by now. Stop trying to find ways to kill it. You don't need to kill every mob in the game. It's not going to be a boss, so don't even bother worrying about it. I'm almost sure that it won't be required for the \"Monsters Hunted\" advancement, either.</p>",
