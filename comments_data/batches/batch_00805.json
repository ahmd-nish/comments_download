Winches could be added as functional and flavourful contraptions in mines, when powered they lower a platform to either the first block below them or based on the Redstone signal strength they are given, they would add a cool machine to take home from your adventure and install in your home or own mines, whilst simultaneously making a lot of sense to be used in a mineshaft to get between levels.</p>\n<p>That about sums it up, I have had a few new ideas writing this but I need to flesh the out a bit first, I hope this is seen and thanks for reading it!&nbsp; &nbsp; (:</p>",

My friends and I have a server that we just updated with the new Wild update and already after only a couple days our entire town has a sculk infestation. There's nowhere to go that's safe, and the warden is going to be summoned to our village/base at any moment, and it's not as though we can simply run away from the sighting and not return, because it's our home. I would suggest not getting rid of the warden because obviously some like having it, but having a cheat where you can disable warden spawn like you can (or could, idk if you still can) phantoms. I personally don't enjoy that sort of gameplay, but the wonderful thing about minecraft I always felt was that it is diverse to be able to play according to personal preference. Now I feel as though I don't have a choice, and I'm nervous to continue playing because I don't want sculk to spawn every time I farm my animals (like they just did). Just some of my thoughts.</p>",

They can gain loyalty from a baby falcon by regularly feeding it overtime. Additionally Falcons should be able to go at the max world height and detect mobs from 100 blocks down. When they attack they will dive directly down onto them. When loyal Falcons may go and rest on you, they may also bring you some of the loot from the mobs they hunted. Additionally when the falcon is nearby or above you and you are under attack by specific mobs the falcon will help fight them off by flying up and diving. You can get it to lay more eggs by feeding it and if a nest is close enough. I don't think the leather glove itself should nessessarilly be included though.</p>",

I was wondering, how can we go back to that version? I downloaded a thing called TLaucher, but It did not work right at all. What can I do to downgrade back to 1.17.11? You should make a built in feature, that lets us choose what version we want, like there in play, marketplace .... then choose minecraft version. I am sure you can do that. Then we can choose 1.16.2 or 1.17.11 or 1.17.30, and so on.&nbsp;</p>",

Unfortunately, not getting to explore a key part of the game closes off a lot of exploration, which is something I enjoy in Minecraft. Adding the wardens turns the game into something other than what it has been up until this point. Minecraft is not and should not play as a horror game. I'm all for new mobs and new challenges, but adding an unkillable mob (according to Mjoang, they don't want players to be able to kill them) adds a level of frustration and blocks off future updates for players like myself. There are plenty of games to go to if you want challenge, stealth, and horror. Minecraft always appealed to me specifically because it WASN'T those things. That's not to say it's not somewhat challenging, but it's a breath of fresh air compared to other games.</p>",

If you think about it though things like ghasts and soul sand valley are scary (kind of because its minecraft) because they have things to do with ghosts. The illagers seem to be very sinister and angry at villagers because of the way they attack and also the fact pillagers just appear in that kind of area (along with their towers).

As well as this, it has the health of an enderdragon doubled and it is very hard to defeat. I play on peaceful and even though they don't spawn, players that want to challenge themselves to hardcore or hard difficulty, wont stand a chance against it, so the level for strip mining will be up to y level 5-9, which defeats the purpose of the deeper levels.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Top tip: Dont update the game to 1.19 and it is best if you go to 1.16 or 1.17</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Imagine if it was the other way around and only bedrock players could use a mob switch. I promise you'd be just as annoyed as us bedrockers. I'm not a keyboard guy whatsoever and the mods for using a controller on Java, and I mean all of them, are absolute garbage. The fact that there's any differences between the platforms is kinda the biggest pile of garbage ever. Why make a console version of the game if it's going to be so drastically different? It's just a tease. Like what? We're supposed to just avoid the biggest update the game has had in years all because it's completely different and 1000 times harder on bedrock than it is on java? What kind of response is that? A stupid one at best. The games should be 100% identical. And I often times think the devs completely disregard that minecraft is a sandbox game above everything else when they make patches or just choose to not implement exploits in bedrock that are the crowning jewels in java. At least make a 1-1 mod that allows console players to use a all system controllers compatible for Java. It's like we're being punished for preferring a controller over a massive and Cluny keyboard. All they did was divide a community that's supposed to be united. Bedrock version is like being on probation. You're legally not allowed to drink while you have to watch everyone else party and for some reason it's your fault. </p>",
