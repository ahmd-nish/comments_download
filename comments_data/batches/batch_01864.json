Furthermore I suggest simply using the sulphur, redstone dust, and charcoal mix I suggested to craft the gun powder separately.

Some of the designs players have come up with, like using banners to create letters, are absolutely brilliant and work perfectly with the current shelf block. These creative uses show the potential of the block for aesthetic builds and clever design tricks.</p>\n<p data-start=\"426\" data-end=\"859\">That said, it’s hard to ignore that having the item floating in the center of the block doesn’t really make sense visually. It breaks immersion, especially in builds where realism or visual consistency matters. And when the item is placed at the bottom of the block instead, the overall appearance feels less harmonious. It gives the impression that something is missing or off-balance, especially when viewed from a few blocks away.</p>\n<p data-start=\"861\" data-end=\"1229\">I believe that the current style of the shelf no longer fully fits the way players want to use it. So there are really two options: either we stick with the old system, where the item floated in the center, because it looked good and worked well with certain build hacks, or we redesign the shelf block entirely to make it look good with the item placed on the bottom.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1231\" data-end=\"1474\">A visual redesign of the shelf could help make the new item placement feel more intentional and cohesive. That way, the shelf would look natural and appealing again, and it would continue to support both creative and functional uses in builds.</p>",

You still only have to dump items into one unoxidized chest beside the entryway.</li>\n<li>Golems can read item frames and can put items in the chest that match the frames.

I do have a few concerns that will probably be fixed by the time the Copper Golems are released, but I want to share them just to make sure Mojang gets a chance to see them.<br><br>The Copper Golem shouldn't take fall damage just like how the Iron Golem and Snow Golem don't take fall damage. Especially since the Copper Golem is made out of metal.<br><br>Chests should be removed from the copper chest crafting recipe since building Copper Golems also builds a copper chest without any wood being involved (<em>or just remove the copper chest from spawning with the Copper Golem</em>). Also, the modified recipe would fit in line with the other non-wood chest recipe: The Ender chest, which doesn't require a chest to craft.&nbsp;<br><br>The Copper Golem should be made with two blocks of copper instead of one. One block of copper being enough to create a Copper Golem AND copper chest doesn't make sense. A copper chest alone requires eight copper ingots to craft, which means the Copper Golem is only comprised of a single copper ingot and a jack-o-lantern. If Copper Golems were made with two blocks of copper (arranged like how Snow Golems are built), then that means a Copper Golem is comprised of a block of copper, plus a copper ingot for the lightning rod on his head (<em>or just remove the copper chest from spawning with the Copper Golem</em>)<br><br>Regardless, thank you Mojang for adding the Copper Golem! :)</p>",

If there is no match in the first chest, it would keep checking other chests close by avoiding the ones (10) already checked. If it finds where to put the items, it would remember that last item and last chest. When it goes back to the copper chest, It tries to pick the same items as the last and then it would go straight back to the last chest and repeat that until all those items are moved. Then, if it's a new item or if the last chest does not match anymore, it would simply start at random again. If no matching chest is ever found, it could put the items back into the copper chest and start the random process again.</p>",

I think a few issues with their \"search for chest to place item\" behaviour/AI task is holding them back significantly;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They keep targetting chests that they can't actually pathfind to.</li>\n<li>They sometimes target chests that they can't even see, or at least shouldn't be able to see.</li>\n<li>I've seen them look through the same double chests twice with the same item, even though that shouldn't happen, no? They shouldn't be checking the same place twice right away.</li>\n<li>I've seen them give up on placing an item even though they were two blocks away from the appropriate chest, and they just never tried looking in it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Also, they're just slowww.

If you do, then all the copper golem has to do is go to that chest and check to see that the correct items are still inside and that is has space, and then it can place it, or if it doesn't, then it will delete that entry in it's memory and go back to the start of it's loop. Easy, and SO useful!</p>",

        "body": "<p>I agree, wam light is cozy generally, and on torches makes sense, but a lot of builds look awful and dark with it implemented so strongly and across the board. For example my main base is largely white concrete and smooth quartz inside, its meant to have a clean aesthetic to be a place where I can look at colors and think and plan builds, sort of a blank slate. Its a large bright open space, and its dark and feels like a cave now.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>More than it effecting any one build though, it simply changes the appearance of colors too strongly. White concrete, the most bright and flattest white color in the game, looks yellowed due to the effect when its any more than one block away from the sea lanterns I use for lighting, and the yellow look is substantially more pronounced with every block further away. This means you literally cant use white as a color inside of a build without sky light exposure. The end product will always have a yellow/brown tint to it, and that tint will be splotchy and uneven in almost any build.</p>\n<p>I think a possibility could be to have it implemented differently with different lighting blocks. Blocks which make sense to have particularly warm light, torches, camp fires, magma, lava, could have warm lighting. But we should have the Option for lighting without those effects. Blocks like sea lanterns, end rods, and frog lights for example, look closest to florescent bulbs in real life and could keep the cooler looking lighting that preserves the visual colors of the blocks around them.</p>",

I noticed this while building my new house and started wondering if something was wrong with my game options or GPU settings. <br>I understand why this change was implemented but the effect was way overdone in my opinion. The old lighting was perfect, so why change something that works? Please revert it.</p>",

They couldn't reach it. I gave them ladders. They DID reach it, but then got stuck and couldn't get off of the ladder. I also tried stairs, but for that to work the whole storage room design would have to be changed, which I don't think players would be happy about, as stacking chests on top of each other is really space-saving and just convenient. So if making golems reach higher isn't an option, maybe we can at least get them better ladder-climbing ability? I would really appreciate something like that.</p>",
