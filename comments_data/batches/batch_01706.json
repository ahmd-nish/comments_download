I suspect that shared worlds would be difficult because of the way consoles(ps4) separate different users data. But why must the active profile be player 1, or be a player at all?  All the worlds could be created on the same profile and some management on how players join.  Though on PS4, only 4 ps4 accounts can be logged in at once so 4 players playing on the account of the person who isn't there wouldn't work because it would require 5 ps4 profiles logged in. If there is a way to make it happen I hope that they will consider implementing it. 4 player split screen on Windows would be great too then I could ditch the console but that's for another thread.</p>",

Having to leave a device logged into a world 24/7 just so others can join is not practical, because it pauses the world and does not allow others to join if the host has the game paused or running in the background. Playing your own world offers 8 player slots, and a realm only offers 10, so paying for a realm is not plausible at the extra cost. Especially when a dedicated server on a really good internet connection could easily handle 20+ players at one time.<br><br>PC users have a button in the Servers tab to \"Add Server\", and it should be present on all devices/consoles. This suggestion is three years old at this point and is becoming more and more relevant for many players in this era, but not enough people know to come here to make suggestions like this.<br><br>Developers can use the same concept for this as is available to PC users at no additional impact other than making it noted to users on certain devices if their device is not compatible with the add-ons included on that dedicated server.</p>",
