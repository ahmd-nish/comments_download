        "body": "<p>I had a limit of characters, so I will continue on this comment:</p>\n<p>- Structures in the Deep Dark.</p>\n<p>Firstly, it will be the the little house shown at Minecraft Live. Nothing to special about the structure in itself, but they would be sligthy common, like every 2 or 3 Deep Darks you will find it. In the house, there were some barrels, and I think most of them would be empty, exept one. The loot table in it is similar to mob cages, exept switching some items to contain deep dark stuff. Instead of bones or rotten flesh, there could be Sculk Growths and candles</p>\n<p>Finally, there would be... Strongholds. I saw this idea in many Youtube channels, but I want to make my own take on it. I wont stick to the story of it too much, so if you want details you can watch Game Theorists video about it. The stronghold would be completely covered by a new almost indistructible material, maybe harder than obsidian, that would make more sense to enter by its only entrance, in the cave. This entrance would be different of the entire rest of the structure. It will be the wardens Hive, with 2 wardens guarding it and a sculk room, that could give you weakness by spores of some sort of spores or something. Making impossible to fight the Wardens, and making you sneak around them. The rest of the stronghold would be mostly the same, exept with some rooms with spawners to make it more challenging. Finally, at the entrance to the portal room, there would be another warden. It would make it much more challenging.</p>",
