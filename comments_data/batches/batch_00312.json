I have a lot of valid points and I know you probably won't check it out so I just copied and pasted it here enjoy! :D</p>\n<p>What I want is iron in the nether this would randomly generate and would be called volcanic scrap. This would drop iron nuggets, this would help out players that venture into the nether and make living in the nether much more sustainable. This would help players doing the start in the nether challenge by giving them the opportunity to craft iron gear and tools this would make nether exploration more desirable for newer players because they will always have access to iron armour and tools. Combine this with the ability to get ancient debris which after smelting they would be able to create a loadstone that would give newer players a way to explore the nether without fear of not finding there way back to their portal. And If their portal was not lit they could do some resource gathering and get a flint and steel. In conclusion, this would tempt newer players to explore the nether farther than they ever would before because It would eliminate many worries the nether has to offer. And be a great addition to Minecraft that would improve and create a more enjoyable nether exploration experience.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I like this idea! Although, I disagree with the phantom idea, I think it could be that it prevents phantoms from attacking you the night you drink it, but the next coffee-less and sleepless night there are more. I definitely think the haste/swiftness effect, and I absolutely love the milk and sugar idea!! I think that after the coffee \"wears off\" the player could have temporary slowness and maybe nausea (like fatigue). And, I think rather than the bottles potions are typically brewed in, there could be a new \"coffee mug\" or just a mug and they could also implement tea and since each biome has different leaves, they each have a different tea with different effects!&nbsp;</p>",
