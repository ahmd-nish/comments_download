According to Kingbdogz, the Deep Dark wouldn't look even remotely like what we've seen in Minecraft Live, so the entire experience and gameplay would be a lot more immersive and fun than how I've described it here. I still do agree though that it would be a very nice touch to give the Warden a unique death scene. After all a unique mob like that deserves a death scene that fits with its theme and design, and even if it wouldn't normally die in legit Survival, it will really contribute to the lore and polish of the mob.</p>",

Could have Redstone left in places from them using it to set off tnt. Could have a broken portal that goes to an abandon mineshaft in the overworld. The portal in the overworld in the mineshaft could be different in some way. My idea comes from the idea that they mined for netherite and went back and forth between the mineshafts in the overworld. Could have sand pockets near the portal.</p>",

Blast Furnaces already exist, Smokers already exist, rails already exist. Etc.</p>\n<p>I think this is a case where either they need to change old recipes to incorporate Copper, like Powered Rails, or come up with a cheaper and only slightly different alternative to existing assets, like a scaffolding block, a faster minecart or a new hopper type, instead of waiting to come up with something completely new and niche. Same goes for Amethyst. My take is that they should look at making old recipes use it, too, like replacing Glass used to craft End Crystals for instance.&nbsp;</p>",

You will be able to use them to get Powdered Snow as well as renewable lava using Pointed Dripstone. As for Copper, it is still very early in development. Building uses are actually a huge part of Minecraft, and Copper is really unique when it comes to building. Besides, they seem to have a lot of plans for it. For instance, the Brushes we've seen during the Archaeology video in Minecraft Live seemed to be made out of Copper. Copper seems to have a significant historical factor due to how it weathers and its possible relationship to archaeology, and I definitely like that design. It will definitely be a more themed, useful and integrated building mineral than Quartz. There are still a lot of things we don't know about when it comes to Copper and its uses, we just need to be patient.</p>",
