You could have a modified biome that plays all the wrong sounds, or a jungle with slightly off colors, or a plains with a weird sky, a pitch black ocean, a snow covered desert. There was even a Holes and Decay biome that would go perfectly. A bioime filled with holes would be weird, or a place where all the block are floating away would also be strange.Just knowing that such things could be out there somewhere far away would be intriguing. I think you should try and play to the strengths of the computer generated style and mathematic derivations a little bit more. It's Minecraft, it doesn't have to be realistic, it just needs to be familiar enough but mostly MInecraft.<br><br>And just two ideas I thought of to add to the weirdness: <br>A pig that stays in one spot. You can move the pig, but it will just go back. It just stands there, staring.....<br>Or a sheep that continually goes in one direction. Avoids danger, but continually just goes in a direction. Who knows where it's going? Only the sheep knows.</p>",

Three of the closest mobs and 2 of the closet biomes, or 3 close mobs or biomes and 2 very far away but more anomalous ones, or something to that affect. How it would tell the player where to go and how accurately? Would you even be guaranteed to find something? I'm not sure. <br>You could possibly have an expert librarian offer a book that has just one mob or biome.
