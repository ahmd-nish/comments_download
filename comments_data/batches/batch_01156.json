The only problem is that they've said that big updates would still be a thing and... that hasn't happened yet.</p>\n<p>You're right that you're not the only one who doesn't like the drops because they don't make you have the same hype, but people who think like that are the minority and still at least you don't have to wait for too long before a new update with a different thematic is announced.</p>\n<p>Also drops let the team add more variated and small features that normally couldn't with big updates. They couldn't add the nautilus, the spears and the zombie horse to the game in the same update normally nor could they add small things like the shelves, wolf armor and other things and drops work well for that.</p>",

Well, the elytra is still worth getting as the plane will not be as fast and precise as the elytra. this is just a smooth way to get around and for fun games!</p>\n\n<p>ALSO, regarding my idea of a biome and structure in the sky, floating islands with castles on them. most islands dont have structures but if it does, it can either be a small castle with fairly average loot, medium castle with better loot, or the rarest of all, the big castle which is the only place u can find a power core by chance in a chest. This idea will likely encourage player's to take exploration to the next level in the sky looking for this rare and valuable item!\n<br />Maybe in the big castle there could be a new hostile mob to make this item a little more challenging to get your hand on!</p>",
