You need to make trade-offs, so when you want a lot of Iron, you won't be getting any Diamonds along the way. You need to be deliberate about mining and know what you're looking for, and prepare before going deeper, or else you'll run out of torches or pickaxes and not find any reliable sources of either, or even come across the Deep Dark without having any proper gear (like Iron Armor). This makes for a longer, more logical and immersive progression system by comparison to what we have now. As for Ore Veins? Well they're pretty rare and take some deep exploration, which puts you in risk of going across hazards like the Deep Dark. They're not really meant for basic progression but rather for late-game projects, as it's often easier to just use the Iron found at Y=32 to get your basic gear there, then venture and explore deeper.</p>",

Im not sure if this is due to the difference in generation in the overworld or if this is just a bug in the experimental version.
