Then, when harvesting trees, you could break all the leaves to get the saplings, and then remove the exposed trunks! Easy!</p>\n<p>It also adds a new weapon to the game, which people seem to love.

Anything to be smoked can only go there (unless recipe assembled), allowing for three stacks to cook at once. Otherwise it is the base for all recipes. Next you have the cupboard above the fuel source. Bowls go there. Then you have the counter for orders up!</p>\n<p>Non-specific placement recipes (NSPR) cook 1 at a time. If you can cook multiple meats, you can cook multiple of the same SPR so long as there is room and starts at the Rack going up. I.E 3 loafs of Bread at once using 576 Wheat (64x3x3) to make three stacks of Bread. However that is based on flipping the recipe vertical (to match how it looks on the pan going in).</p>\n<p>Placement is context sensitive. If you put your fuel in 1st and the 1st item of a recipe that is alone cookable, it will start cooking. Food first, then fuel. An alternative is resembling mechanics to the real process, I.E. heating first. I would need to tinker with that one. If what’s there does not add up, it does not cook.<br>Subjectively, I carry maybe 30 food at most as I doubt I'd use more while exploring before I'm capped for inventory, but this does accommodate those who mass prep. It also does not interfere with SPR’s while leaving the board open for recipes using up to 9 ingredients. Any recipes that do not require heat, such as golden's or honey bottle (none others exist right now, but salad comes to mind), are done instantly at the crafting table.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/JDZ9lnCe83RVfwXNAHd0NA.png\"></p>",

If the dropped food item is in motion, the rinse does not compute. The dropped food has to be resting against a wall against a current. Rinsable foods will change the color of the water when dropped by the player; orange for carrots, white for rice, etc. it takes 10 seconds to rinse, color changing over time to full strength at 5 seconds, and clearing to normal at 10. If you place another of the same item in the water while rinsing, it resets the timer. If you place a different rinsable item, it changes colors to blend &amp; resets the timer. Rinse debuff is set to item for 8 minutes from pickup along with the other effects. If you add to a stack with the debuff, the shortest timer stands.</p>\n<p><strong>Steamed</strong> - made from placing rinsed foods in the cooker for single items.</p>\n<p>Recipes like steamed vegetables uses rinsed items, but produce a <em>non-debuffed</em> meal. Steamed rice would be <em>debuffed</em>, but Sticky Rice (debuffed Rice and Seasoning) would not (and be made at crafting table.) Eating debuffed food adds saturation based on method.</p>\n<p><strong>Frozen</strong> - Use Salt on ice. Ice melts, water is now below freezing temp. Click single food on ground with bucket. Now it is in the bucket. Put bucket in cold water. If cold water is surrounded by ice, contents freeze. Remove, go make ice cream. If environment supports, cold water last at least 6 game hours &amp; re-freezes at night.</p>",

Beef has been a blessing, but the consensus I’ve heard is why have anything else?</p>\n<p>Well, now you have means to rationalize higher yields. And Sushi, ice cream &amp; anything you can think of that may have felt iffy on the craft table. And with these effects in mind on single items, what recipes do you think you could come up with? A hard boiled egg? Potato Soup? Beef Jerky (Smoked Beef+PoSeasoning)? Caramel (Sugar+pot)? Caramel Apples?</p>\n<p>You get the idea. 😁&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I know it’s been a mentioned idea before, but why the pot? It makes other NSPR possible that don’t use bowls but boil (plus single items) and NSPR that do use bowls but don’t boil; like steamed vegetables. Before it was a moot point, but separating the bowls created that issue.</p>",
