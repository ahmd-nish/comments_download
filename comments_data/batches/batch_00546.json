In my opinion, everything should stack to 64 unless it has a balancing, technical, or practical reason not to. So tools/armor shouldn't stack, powerful combat items like splash potions and water/lava buckets shouldn't stack, and perhaps boats/minecarts shouldn't stack. But almost everything else should just stack all the way to 64.<br><br>We need to help inventory management, not make it even more frustrating. The ender pearl stack size should be changed to match eyes of ender, not the other way around. Ender pearls already have a cooldown mechanic to help balance them, and I personally don't think having large stacks of ender pearls is too overpowered, since you do take damage every time you use them.</p>",

I wouldn't be opposed to trapdoor mechanics (where it can pivot 90*), but I would make it function differently from a trapdoor in terms of mob pathfinding and interaction with redstone elements. I think that, like most other lights, it should be an always on option. That said, I would also like to see redstone toggle-able options, like the copper bulb or redstone lamp!<br><br>Bonus for a handful of different colors/face designs. It could work like frog lights, or even use them as a build element, with the three tones to match different build styles. I would also like to see different face designs (an acacia trapdoor adds a very different visual element from an oak, or an acacia, for example). On the topic of manufacturing these aforementioned lights in-game, I think I would make the build require a frog light and 3 iron bars (crafting table only), and maybe pop out two of the lights (similar to trap doors). With the love that copper has gotten lately, I wouldn't be opposed to copper as the design metal, either!</p>\n<p>The redstone versions, I think, I would set up similar to redstone lamps, but combine glowstone powder, redstone powder (or block??), and the aforementioned metals. Food for thought for the devs, hopefully!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think a block like this would add greater depth and flexibility to builds, allow for cleaner recessed lighting, and potentially add a new farm/gameplay loop to the game.</p>",
