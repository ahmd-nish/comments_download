But also the trades have become more unbalanced. Why should I bother to trade fish or coal when I can get 1 emerald for 1 stone or a mending book for 3 emeralds+book? &nbsp;I think a mending book should be at least 48 emeralds worth. Sometimes prices rise a little but quickly drop again. I suggest setting the value of items to a more fixed value. For example 32 Stone = 8 coal = 6 fish = 4 leather = 1 emerald. And if the same items are sold in high quantity’s raise the price for a longer period of time so players are motivated to trade a larger variety of items with different villagers.</p>",
