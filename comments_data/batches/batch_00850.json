For this a player would need to deliberately move or set up some scenario for the golem to be struck by lightning similar to a super charged creeper. Redstoners would go wild for these additions to the copper golem, they can choose to either have a set timer or randomized chaos.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is used to make the sorter mode faster as well. Overall though, I personally love both the original concept of the copper golem, and the idea being presented here, along with the new concept for sorting chests and would love for both to be implemented in the game!</p>",
