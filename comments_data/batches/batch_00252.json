GRAVEL can be processed into sand for example by running flowing water over it, or dropping it onto copper grates/ sifting it<br>3. the TRIAL VAULTs give you sand when you open them more than once (that would also solve the problem of overflow keys if you enjoy fighting the trial chambers a lot, but cant expand your world any more)<br>4. some new mechanics with STONE were by processing it you get dust that can be crafted into sand.
