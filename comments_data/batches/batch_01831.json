There could be versions of the banner pattern that have decayed in certain places over time and other versions that are complete. <br>An arrow slit block can also be found on the towers and walls of the castle ruins. This block has a hole in it that is the same shape and size as a dispenser hole and it’s in the same place. Not only can players fire arrows through the holes themselves but they also can place a dispenser directly behind the arrow slit so that dispensers can fire arrows through the hole as well. If you try to take arrows from the dispenser when the dispenser is behind the arrow slit, nothing happens. You have to destroy the arrow slit first before you can take the arrows.</p>",

The King could also give quests, and he rewards you with items etc. And maybe the bodyguards could actually be a new mob type, Knights. They would be faster and stronger than iron golems. Perhaps there could even be other mobs such as archers/crossbowmen and shieldmen.</p>",
