That's mean, we will have about 6 type of wooden boxes or 8 if include nether's wood .(and ofcourse portable and nonstackable)\n<br />To balance this and also avoiding shulker box rip off, these wooden box will only have 3-6 slots for item, and ofcourse cannot be placed inside shulker box nor the wooden box itself.\n<br />And with that in mind, definitely the wooden box is smaller than a chest , remember there are 6 (or 8) type of wooden boxes from different wood type, these boxes are great decorations.\n<br />Regarding the recipe , i suggest it should be made with 4logs(single type), 4 leathers and a tripwire hook (or a chest , baley).</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the main idea behind this is actually quite simple. I want a form of a gift box but not as expensive as shulker box.\n</p>",

I definitely think that there is a potential for player launching of some form in Minecaft, especially with blocks like slime blocks, heavy wind however seems too complex for the game and definitely sounds like something an advanced mod would add. Saying that they did add water currents above certain blocks underwater however i think that was purely to speed up vertical movement underwater.</p>\n<p>my suggestion as an alternative feature would be a launcher block, this has the advantage of working with redstone without being so difficult to create and get rid of.

I don't think there should be anything like \"untrading\" with villagers, I think villagers would hate rubies, they would walk away from the ruby ​​block, so we would have the mechanics of directing villagers where we want without having to move them with boats or mine minecarts . But there is a mob that is the opposite of the villagers, the illagers! So should we be traiding with them? I don't think so, we already have a traiding with a hostile mob, the piglins. But I think there should be a similar mechanic with distracting piglins with gold. I don't think you need a set of tools and armor of rubies, but only the block, also because we only have the block of the emerald. So I think that unlike the villagers, the illagers would love the rubies and be distracted by the block of rubies, they would gather around the block and be distracted by it for about a minute (or less) then they would break it! So the illagers could also \"steal\" the rubies from the player! So they have one more reason to hate villagers. Rubies, unlike the emeralds that are generated in the mountains, would be generated under the deep seas. So there could be an explanation of the shipwrecks, maybe some time ago some illagers were looking for rubies under the sea but then they sank for some reason (maybe mob A).&nbsp;</p>",

The lowest branches would be dark oak. They would have a super low chance to spawn in forests, dark oak forests, and jungles. They would also have a chance to spawn having been split by lightning.</p>\n<p>They could add a new leaf, though not a new log. Elder oak leaves have a chance of dropping acorns, apples, golden apples, enchanted golden apples, and sweet berries. They would also have a chance to spawn with beehives on them.</p>\n<p>They would spawn with vines.</p>\n<p>Perhapse there could be a way to get syrup from such trees? (I can't help but want maple syrup in Minecraft, it is essential)</p>",
