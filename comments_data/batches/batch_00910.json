There are lots of times in creative where you can instantly eliminate work in ways that would be impossible in survival. Another useful thing would be adding a confirmation to the /fill and /clone commands if you are filling or cloning over command blocks, just something that pops up in chat warning you before you fill over a whole array of command blocks. I think it would not be too impactful on performance as it essentially does the same thing as the replace parameter.</p>",

On @e, the default is false for compatibility purposes, and on @a and @p and @s the default is true. It would also be nice if the flag is_alive was added to predicates.</p>",

For a short amount of time, they turn red and fall over, before being deleted from the world. During this time, the entity is still there, but it cannot be targeted by any target selectors (unless it is a dead player, which can be targeted using @a). This post is asking for the ability to target mobs while they are in that stage of death. I don't think the original poster meant that he wanted the ability to target mobs that have already been deleted from the world, which is something I oppose and probably what you thought when you saw this.</p>",
