Mojang forced some changes on the server that I play on by having server run casinos removed. However the server is rife with player run casinos and the chat is constantly spammed with players advertising their casinos and the prizes.\n<br />Clearly they see a need to remove casinos from servers but surely they realise they achieve nothing by removing one and leaving 100's of others?\n<br />Additionally, they had the server run \"lottery\" renamed to \"raffle\" however the mechanics have stayed the same. It is not a raffle as raffles have a fixed number of tickets and fixed, predefined prizes. The server is still running a lottery but Mojang seem ok with nothing more than a name change.\n<br />Mojang claim under the heading \"Our commitment to player Safety\", \"We hold ourselves accountable for making Minecraft as safe as possible for everyone\"\n<br />So Mojang claim themselves accountable for this, It doesn't need to be illegal, it just needs to be unsafe and it needs to be possible for Mojang to stop/restrict it.\n<br />Removing/restricting casinos from servers is possible and Mojang have deemed themselves to be accountable for making this happen.\n<br />So, Mojang, Please adhere to your commitment to player safety and start to enact change on servers that allow casinos and gambling. Whether they be legally classified as so or not, because the danger is the same.</p>",

I have run my own java server for years now and loved it. however most of my friends only have bedrock so when I found out about dedicated bedrock servers I knew I had to make one. so I spent like 2 days creating this server in bedrock (which is clearly inferior to java.. I obviously don't understand what's so hard about making bedrock function like java does ) just to find out that my friends on Xbox cant even join my server. Hopefully Mojang/Microsoft can figure out that servers are useless without the ability for people to join them.. I realize its alpha but again, what's the point, everything should already be there from the java edition. side note, I do appreciate that they are going to be bundling java and bedrock together for purchase. however, most people that I know that are interested in getting one or the other, already have one or the other so maybe they can do something for the people who already enjoy Minecraft and want to expand their horizons.&nbsp;</p>",
