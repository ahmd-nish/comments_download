        "body": "<p>I totally agree, looting and the looting system needs a rework. For example how you find loot is completely based on your weared power level, this means that if you wanna use items you like you need to equip trash item which happend to have highest power level before a load screen and then after that you can switch back to your preferable gear. Tedious and stupid.<br><br>Unique items needs a rework too, they need to be more unique than their normal counter part. I found the Whirlwind double axe for example, and it only had a crappy Shockwave enchantment, what if it had a lvl 3 Swirling plus a 25% faster attack speed bonus? That would make it certainly alot better and fit the name \"Whirlwind\" too! Also give unique weapons little bit more base damage than the normal versions of them too.<br><br>Also I feel that most unique items should have a totally unique bonus, maybe a Cursed Axe would have a unique bonus that increases the % chance of all enchantments by 30% or another item that doubles all effect durations, things like that would be really cool and fun but also rewarding to find.<br><br>As a balance they could make these weapons rarer to find if needed.<br><br>Also the enchantment \"Looting\" Should make so items has higher chance to drop aswell like in regular minecraft, as it is now it's pretty useless and I doubt anyone uses it.</p>",

I sometimes ran bored, but it went over again because I knew all the fun things I could do in that game.</p>\n<p>But for Minecraft Dungeons it's a real annoyance. I have run bored of the game honestly. For the last week or so I was first farming for a Renegade armor with double cooldown, but then switch to get battlerobe with double cooldown, but I have gotten none so far. I have probably gotten a few hundred battle robes so far that I have just trashed.</p>\n<p>Even though they shouldn't make farming too easily rewarding, they really should improve how it is now. A big mistake in looting games is to make the stuff people are looking for too hard and tedious to get, or you end up bored like me. All I want is to get what I have been farming for days and have some fun with it, but even that is too much to ask for.</p>",

I find myself losing interest after I've obtained Enchanted armor weapons and have beaten the Ender Dragon and Wither boss I quickly lose interest in playing. My idea was add Quest givers to The Villages that give daily Quests. Some examples of quest would be collect 10 logs 10 Oak planks and 30 Oak fences for a quest turn in which would result in a reward of money or items. A follow-up Quest you could help him build the structure he wants to build with the materials you provided for him. Another idea is generate Villages that are damaged and give quests that aren't dailies available to the player were you need to rebuild this town that was attacked by pillagers. Through a series of quests you rebuild individual buildings and once the whole questline is complete the town will be rebuilt. This would not be an example of a repeatable daily but another idea were questing could go. With infinite World Generation you would never run out of quests to do. I think the rewards of just getting emeralds and things of that nature would get boring over time so maybe implement new items in game that are costly and offer some type of benefit to the player like the beacon does. I have lots of great ideas that could go into this and Hope the developers see this post! </p>",

In the deepdark 1/3 of the way in, the warden will spawn and you'll have to RUN. Please bring back mine carts, which I had an idea for. Empty minecarts do less damage and are faster. Chest mine carts are on a loop and could be an alternative for piggy banks. Lots of minecarts and cave spider spawners in the mineshaft level please. We need more cave spiders, spawners and slimes. And what's minecraft DUNGEONS without DUNGEONS?</p>",

Making obsidian chest more random with a 100% chance to spawn to promote exploration.</p>\n<p>2. Add a Magic Find bar that fill up as you kill enemies to increase your magic find against the end boss of the map. That would be better for the health of the game instead of seeing people rushing chests and bosses without killing anything for the sake of efficiency.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Adding a way to start a map with a \"Normal start\" and a \"Start with an random affix(es)\" which would affect the current map difficulty and reward.</p>\n<p>4. Adding a vendor that \"could\" rarely spawn&nbsp; winthin the map at random location(s) selling a few legendaries in exchange of emeralds. That also would promote exploration of the map instead of seeing people rushing the end of the map.</p>\n<p>5. More events could be added to promote killing and exploration in the future. For exemple, an unique pack of monsters or unique boss that spawn randomly (but rarely) in the map.</p>",

It would be interesting if the tower had a bunch more floors and you could look at a leaderboard in the camp to see who has gone the highest.     Lastly,  thank you for still putting time into MCD.

        "body": "<p>The Tower is an immensely interesting concept, but the kinks laid in the surface of this feature make it more of a half-put together feature for me than a complete one. Starting with the absurd difficulty spike around floor 22, largely due to the royal guards' knockback and how cramped the space is. Perhaps if this floor was as open as the earlier Highblock Halls floor (around floor 6 iirc) and had less mobs, it would be more of a fair challenge. The 25th floor suffers from this cramped space issue too with the glut of wither skeletons and a ghast in the fray. Balancing issues like these would help this feature a lot.\n<br />The roguelike progression system could have the items randomized each time you climb the tower too, and have the Powersmith upgrade 2 items for you, so that you don't sacrifice survivability for more damage? The Gildsmith could give higher gilded enchantments too on Apocalypse.\n<br />Lastly, the rewards. They're valuable, but many complain about choosing one of only 3 items, making it nigh impossible to get what you want from here, a simple fix being 6 rewards after completing the tower (while still having to choose only one) while making the tower better than an extra merchant to the camp.\n<br />Despite only playing the update for a day and not enjoying it too much, I believe Mojang has laid an earthly foundation for better seasons to come, looking forward to future updates!\n<br />TL;DR\n<br />loosen floors 22-25, make items more random in the tower and give the vendors more agency.</p>",

And here comes the good part, let us decide what that item enchants and rarity will be, let the merchants in the tower help us with that task, every 20-25 levels, let us choose an upgrade to add/change from one specific item we brought with us in the tower (for the cost of giving up an upgrade for the next boss). And for god sake, make the tower have a progressive difficulty, I hate when one level kills me twice and I barely escape the third time, but after that, all the levels are a walk in the park. And the main problem: replayability ( make the tower have at least more item combinations, I understand they made it like this so it is challenging, but running it more than 3 times feels like a chore. Give us ways to skip levels, puzzle levels maybe in between the combat levels if u want to skip something, give us chance levels, things that may rely only on luck or skill ( not too many of those, but it can give either a feeling of danger if u get something bad or either courage to go to the combat level next and not skip to the puzzle). The actual tower feels like it was only the work of 3D modeling with someone from the game design who just came in 10 seconds in the room and gave one or two pieces of advice.</p>",

You have decided to put the best rewards in the game on a mode that does not need any gear to complete. What does this do? It makes it so all those rewards you are trying to get mean nothing. They are not required to further get better gear. How did anyone think this was sustainable? This has to be one of the biggest oversights I have ever seen and whoever was behind this decision should be embarrased. Tell me you have no idea what the point of a dungeon crawl is, honestly. Where am I suppose to use all this new over powered gear? In modes that will reward me with gear that is less than what I got in The Tower? The point has become lost. The Tower has made a joke of your game. I am beyond shocked by this.</p>\n<p>If you raise the difficulty it will only further destroy things. This tower should have never held such high gear unless it was acheived with gear we had from other sources.</p>\n<p>You could have made it so your avatar picks a set up from the gear you currently posses and the tower is \"endless\". You could have made it so you can pay 500 gold as an option entry fee to have a chance of gilded items and depending on where you died in the tower and the gear you achieved could have meant you get 262 gilded items while still tieing in a need to run Hunts for the entry gold. I mean honestly the botch is so bad. Nobody wants to play as a level one with a common sword again.</p>",

The player kinda grows and bonds with the build they make in the tower and its almost like a trophy to keep the one piece that helped you through it. Another debatable idea is to keep the enchantment points collected on the item too so you don't have to spend all of yours once you get it. I can see this being a flaw with people overloading in enchantment points but may help boost using them in ancient hunts or if thats to be avoided then make it so if the player gets rid of that item, none of the tower enchantment points are given back to the player. They just stay with the item. Overall the tower is fun and i play each one but the rewards are lackluster</p>",

        "body": "<p>The Tower has become rather stale since release, so here are some suggestions to add value to the Tower. </p>\n\n<p>1. Randomize the Tower.\n<br />The Tower's replayability is by far the worst. No new levels to play after you beat it once, only the same old. Replayability is one of the major reasons why alot of people, like 04AM has stopped playing Dungeons. If every level has randomized sections, for example, there is a bit of Soggy Swamp and Pumpkin Pastures in one level. Randomized mobs, etc. Same with the loot you get every time you finish one level, it should be randomized along with the enchants. This change alone will change the game ALOT.</p>\n\n<p>2. Loot for beating the Tower.\n<br />No one will play the Tower if it's to get the same old items. Add Tower-exclusive items themed toward the seasons. Then people will actually put in the effort to play the Tower, because right now it just feels like a chore to play it. Example: Luminous Skeleton Armor.</p>\n\n<p>3. Difficulty.\n<br />Now, I don't mean to increase the spawn rate of Creepers. I mean DIFFICULTY. As in a challenge in the Tower, the higher the floor, monsters deal more damage, mini bosses, etc. The last boss should be the hardest of all and should reward you with an exclusive item other than to ones you get for beating the Tower.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks, and I REALLY hope this gets implemented in the next update. I assure you that so many more people will actually play the game, as Minecraft and Minecraft Dungeons are my favorite games of all time.\n<br />      Good luck.</p>",

Illusioner is already an imbalanced mess since he can die super quick or last a long time and deal out absurd damage since you're constantly trying to guess which one is real, and by the time you maybe narrow it down, he clones himself again. On top of that, he can blind you so you're punished even if you guess him right.</p>\n<p>The blindness should be an attack that you can see and avoid. And he shouldn't re-clone himself until a few seconds have passed after his clones have been eliminated, so the player is rewarded for narrowing them down instead of feeling at the whims of RNG, since that and the blindness devolves it into RNG.</p>\n<p>But also, sticking him with an Enderman is all kinds of awful. I dealt with him, but barely. I had a strategy to nuke him with a Voidstrike + Illager's Bane Anchor using Gong and Power Shaker to make use of his clones, but was punished by missing because I was blinded outside of my control.</p>\n<p>Illusioner just isn't a fun boss.
