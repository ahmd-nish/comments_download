The first one is a deep ocean flat world with bedrock, stone and water. The second one is a normal flat world desert with no generated structures other than the desert wells. It would be useful if I could choose, the first time I open these worlds in 1.18, how to extend the world from y=-1 to y=-64. I want to replace the bedrock (y=0) in both worlds with stone (maybe deepslate), fill this same block down to y=-63, and then make y=-64 bedrock. I may be interested in generating ores, etc in this new area, though unsure. The key here is that this takes effect for all existing chunks, and not just new ones. I could also add that these two worlds really need at least blocks up to y=511, but that’s another discussion.</p>",
