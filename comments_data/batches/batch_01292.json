Even if I \"lose\" what I paid for one of them if it does get discontinued way down the line, unifying the fanbase on all platforms and also improving the experience all around would make it more than worth it IMO.</p>\n<p>And besides, what you bought was the game as it was with no guarantee of future updates, the fact that the updates are all free and that we are still getting them is a massive bonus. In no way does it warrant you a refund even if they make both games effectively the same.</p>",
