If not please at least make a tad more of the older style caves than the big new ones, makes the new ones feel even more special and grand. I understand if you don't , I am just one person who plays this with my own thoughts. Even if nothing changed I still love the update ,and it would take some massive change that I don't like to change my mind.</p>\n<p>I hope everyone working is doing well and I believe yall are taking Minecraft to new big places.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
