And the likelyhood that you would have 20 emeralds before you have a diamond sword is extremely unlikely.

        "body": "<p>Absolutely not! The new villager trades are wonderful for many reasons, primarily (in my opinion) because they increased the trade cap - I can trade carrots with farmers, for example, like 10 times in one go instead of 4. Carrots are so easy to farm because you throw looting on a hoe from an anvil and you get 64+ carrots from an 8-10 plot of farm. Same with potatoes. I am able to level up a villager to master in one sitting and that was never possible before. Emeralds are now significantly easier to obtain than they were before and it’s only natural that the prices be amped. I always thought it was strange that the diamond things were as cheap as they were to be honest. There’s a reason so few people have upvoted this post. It’s a very bad suggestion that I hope they ignore completely. You say the unlikelihood of having 20 emeralds is unlikely, but are you just really bad at trading or something? I got 33 emeralds from ONE farmer in one trading session just last night. And I have 2 farmers. You can sell rotten flesh to clerics, an item you will have at any point in the game. I say all that to say this: you’re wrong. You either don’t research properly, haven’t traded with villagers enough to know better, or just aren’t willing to put in the work to get the emeralds.</p>",

The iron farms have been so badly nerfed on console and bedrock that in order to suit up and explore more dangerous areas we are constantly mining.  I am out of iron in my game because we built a super smelter system in order to smelt our items automatically so we could build a huge castle.  The castle looks great.  But I'm wearing leather and back to stone again.  If I want my farm to produce I have to afk.  I don't like to play that way. </p>",

Also another big issue is now this biome specific trade option thing forces me to keep looking up which enchantments correspond to which biome, and what the level cap is for that enchantment for the librarian, is it a master level trade? I shouldn't need to do a research project every time I want to just play the game, either have in game data, or don't have such specific biome locking. All in all, this villager rebalance feels so forced and not fun, it just adds more tedium and just another thing where I need to open up external resources to make anything out, Mojang stop just stretching out the midgame. Also I agree, enchantment table needs to be improved, they could've applied these biome specific enchantments to the enchantment table, or at least have a weighted system where certain enchantments become more likely in a specific biome but not hard locked.&nbsp;</p>",
