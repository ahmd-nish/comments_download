It is supposed to be a hellish underworld; if there is no ceiling, there is nothing unique, it would be just like the Overworld or End. Besides, I'm sure this ceiling is intentional, and if they thought the Nether would be better without a ceiling, they would have removed it. I've never felt like the Nether was like an overworld cave, because no caves are that big (until now), nor do caves have any of the same material as the Nether besides gravel and lava (which is by far more abundant in the Nether). The Nether generation is very chaotic, which is something unique about it. I'm sure after 1.17 we'll see even more difference between the Nether and Overworld caves in terms of both generation and material, or maybe this is something the developers should additionally keep in mind.</p>",
