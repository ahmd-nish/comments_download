This would allow you to have both circuits side by side in a build without effecting each other. This would also allow for vertical redstone signals. However copper wires will be more expensive than redstone. When you mine redstone you get a lot of it, but not so much in terms of copper ingots. Copper will also be what is needed to connect to certain other copper type devices, and vice versa with redstone. For example you would need redstone to connect to a skulk sensor.</p>",

I suck at names but something like that. You'd place it in water to let it get wet over a short bit of time, then when you place it near lava it turns all lava in a normal sponge's area into stone (lava source blocks) and cobblestone (flowing lava blocks), maybe with a magma block shell around the changed blocks, and the block dries out when used. Similar idea to the <strong>Pumice</strong> block, but I thought I'd add in my idea. It's not exactly a lava sponge, but I thought it would make more sense with how water and lava interact. Plus it ties into the piglins! Maybe they'd even toss one out on their own very rarely? Doubtful but just an idea.</p>",

However, I wouldn't give it a corrupting effect because this already exists in the form of fermented spiders eye. What I would do is make a whole new set of potion effects which could only be obtained using warped nether wart. So basically, use it same as the regular variety to make the potion base, and then the additional items would have different effects.</p>\n<p>For example, adding a carrot to an awkward potion gives you a potion of night vision (corrupted version using fermented spiders eye gives a potion of invisibility), but adding one to a warped potion could give you the ability to see clearly in swamp water (very useful if you're looking for clay), and a corrupted version when a fermented spiders eye can be used in addition could make trees semi-transparent and allow you to see hostile mobs hiding in the woods. My point is that there are loads of possibilities without recreating what already exists from another easily obtainable item, but the idea of a warped nether wart is a great one and should be considered for a future update, it can double the number of potions we can brew!</p>",

Imagine setting up zip line access points all over a cliff base to zip up and down to higher or lower area in a flash. You can add a redstone powered pulley system to crank you up a zip line to a higher location, or use the grappling hook to create a new upward line. The grappling hook should have a limit to its distance, say 10-20 blocks, which would require you to build connection areas. Perhaps add anchors or a type of belay system that would be needed to set up the connection area to extend the zip lines over greater distances. This would be incredibly fun while exhilarating because of the fall chance. This idea is a must!</p>",

        "body": "<p>So, I've seen other posts talking about an elevator block, but none have done it the way I envision.</p>\n\n<p>Basically, it'll be a 2x1 block that you can enter and there will be two buttons inside it: an arrow pointing up and an arrow pointing down. Pushing the up arrow brings you to the next elevator block above your current Y position.Pushing the down arrow brings you to the next elevator block below your Y position.</p>\n\n<p>I'm aware of ladders and pistons and all the other mechanics in the game. I still want a dedicated elevator block, not only because it would make things far more compact, but also because a lot of the structures I make would look better without a big glaring brown ladder where an elevator should be or some complicated redstone setup buried around it just so I can move up a few blocks. </p>\n\n<p>The elevator could be powered by redstone, and even activated via redstone - you could use it to send items up and down. Yes, I am aware of the water jet streams, but that is hardly practical. I don't want to go hunt for water, magma blocks, and soul sand just to go up and down quickly. Plus, those are only one way. You can't choose where to stop the items in the flow of those streams without even more redstone fiddling. </p>\n\n<p>With my idea, you could place elevator blocks on top of each other to create new floors - and there could even be a display in the elevator block telling you what floor you're on as well as which floor you would like to go.</p>\n\n<p>For example: let's say I place an elevator at 345, 67, 21, and let's say I place another elevator at 345, 78, 21. If I press the up arrow on the one in the Y:78 position, nothing will happen since that is the highest floor. But if I press the down arrow, I'll be either teleported or pushed down to the Y:67 position. Now, let's say I place another elevator block at 345, 123, 21. If I want to go to the Y:123 position from the Y:67 position. I could either press the up arrow twice, or I could select the 3rd floor from the little display within the elevator and then press the up arrow. </p>\n\n<p>I think it would be a nice, long-awaited addition to the game, and it would make traversing holes and shafts far more practical than just jumping down, using jet streams or some oversized redstone contraption.</p>",

While it is close to what I envision, it suffers from the same problem I had with the ladders: it's not aesthetically pleasing, you still have to climb up or down to specific floors rather than being brought to them via a button, and the controls while on scaffolding are a bit annoying. I'm so used to pressing shift to not fall off blocks when building - now I gotta worry about sinking to the bottom of my scaffolding when pressing shift. This is especially annoying when scaffolding is meant to help build structures.</p>",

Of course, the glass couldn't be transparent, so looking through Soul Glass looks like the player has the Blindness effect, or similar. The glass would have a blueish texture, in keeping with the 'Soul' theme.</p>",

(so the total experience used from the experience bar would be 12 experience levels), and it would cost 4 experience for a bottle of 20 experience levels. (so the total experience used from the experience bar would be 24 experience levels.) and so on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The issue I see is the same as mentioned prior, \"that experience loss is truly the only bad thing that happens when a player dies.\"&nbsp; I would like the idea of thinking smart about your experience and always being cautious but I do believe just like any other block in the game there should be some way to obtain it? We are not always in control of what happens in the game and that is why there is a bug report options and feedback options.&nbsp; My friends and I have personally lost over 100 levels of experience due to this bug (MCPE-38374). It would be nice to know that there is another way to save experience earned from countless hours of killing mobs, breeding animals, mining, and smelting/cooking items.&nbsp;</p>",

This will give you throwable dragon's breath (possibly usable as a weapon? If not it might produce a cool particle effect.) And then all you need to do is put the essence siphon in a crafting table with the bottle of throwable dragon's breath to get a Bottle of Enchanting. The Essence Siphon would take 1 durability of it's 32, the bottle of throwable dragon's breath would be used, and the bottle of enchanting would contain one level. The siphon could be made of really anything but I am thinking of maybe a mix of phantom membranes, a stick or 2, a shulker shell or chorus fruit or something else. It just needs to include something you can only get after beating the ender dragon to make sure it's not too op.</p>",
