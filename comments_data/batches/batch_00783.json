I spawned right away close to a shattered Giant Taiga mountain that went up to 225! It was so much fun to explore; the world generation keeps tempting you to go in so many directions you don't know from where to start! It only took me 1:30 to 2:00 hours to find a MASSIVE cave entrance. Of course, this could've have been insane luck, but overall I think the cave systems themselves are absolutely spot on. They're absolutely insane without being overwhelming, and keep tunneling and going further down. I believe that would be mostly universal, as I found quite a lot of them for a long duration; they continued on from spaghetti to cheese cave until I reached around -45, and there are other ways I haven't taken. From what other people are saying, I think it's just a matter of being harder to find. The caves themselves are great, the entrances and connections to Noodle caves are what needs work. I'll need to test more to decide, but honestly it seems that those who are saying that the caves are too small just had bad luck. He/She probably just only ran into tunnels that go through Mountains or only found Noodle caves, which brings up the issue that Noodle caves often cut off and are indeed discouraging to explore as they most likely never connect to bigger caves. They are not a gaurantee of anything.</p>",

The caves that I ran into had a great mix between insane caves exposed to the surface and more medium sized and smaller caves that keep winding through. It honestly has the best of both worlds as far as I've seen. Will need to test more, but honestly I really like the overall balance of the cave systems from what I've seen both in my testing and elsewhere. There is a lot of variation, which means with enough exploring you'll get lucky and find huge caves just like I did. Most of the caves will be \"medium\" (which by themselves look epic), making the huge caves more rewarding to find. Besides, the caves keep winding forever and reach the depths, so with patience you can find huge caves. What could use improvement is surface interactions, as sometimes the caves form tunnels through mountains that despite looking great, don't lead to the underground, and more importantly the only entrances I've seen forming were huge ones, which are fairly rare, but that means there is less access to the underground. The solution I see is with noodle caves intersecting more with the surface and other caves, and having less aquifers on the surface. This will make the underground much more accessible without making the mega cave entrances too common or messing up the cave size and distribution balance.</p>",

For now in the latest beta version 1.17.40.23 the details to improve I think are the interference of aquifers and waterfalls that can appear on the surface or next to cave systems.  They become in an unorganized, unnatural way, very frequently generating waterfalls that give huge drops in FPS and rendering, on the other hand: the excessive generation of ores, not the generation of tuff in negative parts, a large generation of trees in the meadow biome as well as the incorrect generation of blocks with a height greater than one (drip leaves and tall grass) are minor problems but worth looking at.  They do an amazing job 😊</p>",

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called \"Linux\", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called \"Linux\" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.</p>",
