We have things in there that vibrate at the same frequency as the air that comes in. Our brain senses the things in our ears that vibrate, and measures the vibrations, which we interpret as pitch. If the skulk sensors vibratey things are unable to vibrate, the skulk sensor would just hear silence, because the tentacles are not vibrating.</p>\n<p>I am reasonably sure this is how ears work. And even if not, this idea works anyway. The dangley vibratey bits are obviously the thing that hears the sound, and restraining them, or cutting off the circulation, either way, would stop the organism from registering the sound.</p>",

Each structure would offer a pool of common shards (blank, tree, flower, animals..) and one or two shards unique to that structure. To collect all the shards in the game you would need to travel to a variety of structures sometimes visiting multiples of the same structure to claim the rarest shards and giving the player a reason to adventure out even into the late game. Shards then become trophies of your adventures as well as a story telling device allowing you to show off your rarest as pots and maybe also mosaics in item frames.</p>\n<p>That way when you see a ruined portal or underwater ruin in the late game you don't just head their for the loot, you can also dig around for those missing shards from your collection.</p>",

In my opinion copper isn't useful enough as is, and will need more uses in future updates for me to even consider adding another overworld ore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the actual idea, I think the scuba gear has some merit, but the lead and oxygen tank should be taken away, the former not useful enough to add as a new ore and the latter being too modern. Instead of lead boots, Gold boots/armor should make you sink faster as it is very heavy. The lead in the crafting recipes should be replaced with iron or copper. With the oxygen gone, The scuba gear should double breathing time, increase swim speed, and increase vision underwater.</p>\n<p>Question: why do the lead boots which make you fall faster decrease fall damage? If anything it should increase it.</p>",
