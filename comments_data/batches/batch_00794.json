Well Sculk Sensors don't really warn the Warden, and they should definitely drop themselves. Lastly: All of the features and blocks in the Deep Dark are referred to as \"Sculk\". The name \"Warden\" means \"a person responsible for the supervision of a particular place or thing or for ensuring that regulations associated with it are obeyed.\" It is not a prefix that is meant to be used with any of the Deep Dark features. Just a friendly advice, maybe get more background about the Deep Dark, Sculk, and Warden before suggesting anything concerning them, because otherwise it doesn't sound convincing and doesn't make sense.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I don't agree that materials should only be available from mining. I've never seen or heard anybody try to get Netherite from just Bastion Remnants, because mining it is way more reliable. Besides, Melly Dow, you don't even know what loot will be in the Deep Dark, so how did you infer that it'd is pointless? Kingbdogz did tease that there will be special loot to find down there, and I'm sure they know what they're doing. The whole experience of the Warden is (terrifyingly) enjoyable even without overpowered loot. Additionally, I believe that giving people options to getting certain objects is often a good thing, especially when they're things you'd use so frequently. The point is to make Mining the most reliable, desirable and FUN way of getting minerals, which is precisely what they're doing with this update. Why would you want to keep lazily trading with Villagers when you can explore the vast underground and find everything you need while discovering a lot of fascinating things along the way. By going up Mountains, for instance, you can find crazy amount of Iron while just exploring or even clearing parts of the Mountain for a build. I've seen a YouTuber who relies almost exclusively on farms considering that it might seriously be worth mining in the end-game while he was exploring in the (early) snapshots. By making you really want to explore the caves, they've essentially solved most of the problem.</p>",

I really do think the Warden should be very overpowered because the game needs something that, say, speedrunners can't just kill in under thirteen minutes and give you a bunch of wonderful loot. There should be a sense of achievement when one eludes the Warden, and part of that is doing something extremely difficult and succeeding, but another is gaining something that you've earned; something that reminds you of your struggles in the deep dark, and something that will help you out in different areas of the game.</p>",

In terms of fighting it, absolutely OP and cannot be killed normally, but they are implementing a balance in terms of how you could stealth around it and avoid it while being able to loot the Deep Dark, all while having a horrific and fun experience. As for the loot, consider that all of the blocks in the Deep Dark seem to have a unique Redstone, as suggested by a footage of them all arranged in the Redstone tab in the Creative inventory (it's on the Wiki). They will also definitely implement unique loot that you could exclusively find in the chests of the structures, Kingbdogz briefly talked about that on Twitter. However, they cannot possibly have almost every item you find in chests be unique to the Deep Dark. They cannot come up with so many items and give each a unique use. They definitely would want to include loot that could come from other sources so that it isn't overwhelming.</p>",
