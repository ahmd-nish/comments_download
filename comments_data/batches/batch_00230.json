I made a post under the mobs section that elder guardians should each drop 1/3 barbs used for crafting a trident. It fits thematically with their thorns attack and implies lore about the origins of the drowned, which is fun. I obviously agree with the OP’s idea of making tridents craftable as this eliminates the need to grind for tridents by killing massive numbers of drowned. Drowned can still drop them, but this provides an alternative. And making the barbs a guaranteed drop of the elder guardians incentivizes beating more than one monument (so you can take advantage of the mutually exclusive enchantments on tridents), while simultaneously rewarding players with a weapon to make beating the next monument a bit easier. </p>",
