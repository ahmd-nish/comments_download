Then if the player still has not moved from a short distance, keep increasing the odds until it hits 100% spawn rate of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This would effectively shut down AFK Fish Farms, as AFKers would essentially die from poison damage from spawned pufferfish due to not moving at all. Players who are legitimately fishing will walk away from their spot to reset the percentage in the script as well as time variables attached to it and come back and won't suffer much reprecussion, and they can eat the raw fish they are catching anyways to regain health.</p>",
