Especially the Warden changes, it is cool to know that the developers are working really hard to make the Warden tougher and not cheese-able. The Warden's sonic boom being able to ignore armor and enchantments is certainly welcome. However, I have a proposal for a change on the next pre-release(if there are any). Could the Warden's sonic boom be protected by \"Projectile Protection\" or \"Blast Protection\"? I feel like this change would be beneficial to Minecraft players as a whole. Firstly, it would give players more flexibility and variability in terms of utilizing different armor enchantments. Secondly, Projectile Protection and Blast Protection to some degrees are looked down upon and most players prefer to utilize the go-to \"Protection IV\" all the time. This change would definitely give \"Projectile Protection\" and \"Blast Protection\" more love and attention to players. Other than that, definitely great sets of changes in the recent pre-release!</p>",

They're great for making youtube videos and reactions, which will further popularize Minecraft.</p>\n<p>Still, I sure wish we can have fireflies and firefly bottles as light blocks in the future, maybe in the end update? Please don't just add enderman variants in the end update, hostile mobs need more creature variety like dragons, arthropods, fishes, etc. Perhaps a scary doppelganger enemy like herobrine can be memorable and iconic too! Magic and spells also fit well.</p>\n<p>In the future, I'm really hoping for an actual wild update. Mobs like crickets can add a ton of immersion and ambience to Minecraft, and they can be food for frogs, axolotls, fish. Ambient sound effects like rustling leaves, sea winds, and cave drips are also great. Now THAT's a wild update!</p>\n<p>I feel like the deep dark still needs more sculk material, especially shriekers. There's too much boring gray. It's too easy to clear an ancient city without any warden spawning. Wardens should spawn easier; three sculk shrieker activation should be enough to summon the warden!</p>",

Maybe each copper rail can accelerate a minecart 1-2 blocks/second based on oxidation level, while gold rails can accelerate a minecart 4-8 blocks/second?</p>\n<p>To craft copper rails, I suggest 4 iron ingots, 2 copper ingots, 1 redstone dust, 1 stick, and as an option, 1 honeycomb to craft waxed copper rails. Having rails made with 6 copper ingots would be very cheap, so the iron helps to balance it out. 8 rails from this crafting recipe seems like a fair number to me. To wax rails that are already crafted and/or oxidized, either right clicking on a rail with honeycomb in hand could wax it, or 8 rails surrounding 1 honeycomb in a crafting table could wax all 8 rails.</p>",
