I was thinking redstone dust trails, much thinner than the placement of the redstone dust we have already, but can be powered/illuminated by redstone torches or blocks.</p>\n<p>I was thinking that a type of pouch/container item could be introduced, filled, and manually opened or closed when held in the offhand or main hand. While held and open, it will leave a trail behind the player as they walk, RS dust would require placing RS torch/block/repeater (not that it would be worth repeaters lol) periodically to keep it illuminated.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this container could also be filled with sand (lasts only 5-10 minutes while in that chunk or otherwise active distance, like how item despawn timers pause when you get too far. Not sure of the actual term for this), glow stone dust (the brightest, but perhaps it actually attracts certain mobs and they might follow the path in either direction, possibly catching up to the player), or even crushed bread as actual breadcrumbs (but some mobs may eat them, typically surface animal mobs).</p>\n<p>I also do like the gunpowder dust idea, but personally i think that would function best as a long distance fuse, whereas soul sand could be used for a light emitting trail of fire. Or maybe mixing the two, to make the trail ignite and illuminate when sparked.</p>",

Shears are an item that isn’t used very frequently so not many people would want to make them for even 1 Netherite. \n<br />3) There would not be any good reason to make them other than for the flex. Shears are already instant “mine” on both leaves and sheep, it’s 2 main purposes. Regular shears cost 2 iron and if nothing is better apart from durability, it would just be a waste of Netherite. </p>",
