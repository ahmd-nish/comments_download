I was thinking they could drop wither apples. If they were left the same colour/ texture, players could rename them \"apple\" and could use them to prank friends. Also they could be usede in a potion of some type, or some other food recipe, eg: posion apple pies. they would give some type of negitive effect along with some mild positive effect. i think the wither tree would look quit nice.. plus having a asky coloured wood to work with would be cool.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>possibly craft the planks into a new type of storage, wither chests or something, or wrapping a E-chest, with wither planks in a crafting slot will give you a wither chest, this would turn your echest into a double chest. but you could no longer use regular echests. so it would be a trade off for the player aswell, but they can still recover they're obsidian from breakiong the old echest, so its really not even that much off a loss. anyways I think I've went enough into a small part of my creative ramblings lol... cheers all... so, what do you think?&nbsp;</p>",
