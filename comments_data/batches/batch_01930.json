Pick your favorite!</p>\n<p>The idea is that the buffs justify the rarity and steep price, encourage technical and power players to bling out more as they min/max, and provide a more substantial reward for casual players' effort while also looking cool. And while the balance is a concern, the Effort required is more than justified, as netherite is a similar change to diamond, only a buff to durability and knockback resist while also being a significant effort sink.&nbsp;</p>",

For Oceans they should have the Sunken Skeletons, which use crossbows instead of bows so they can actually shoot underwater (and they can swim too). Frozen Zombies could spawn in the snowy biomes. And Sandy Skeletons could spawn in deserts. It would be cool to see underwater slimes as well.</p>",
