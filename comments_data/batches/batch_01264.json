This would make getting the ideal armor enchantments, allowing you to just run with certain gears and swapping them out with the blacksmith every few runs to focus on numbers. Not to mention the unfathomable odds you get the exact armor you want.<br><br>Take armor for example.&nbsp;<br>There are 23 various enchantments for armors, ignoring a few possible conditions (can't remember if any of the enchants have prereqs.) That's a 4(ish)% chance of getting the enchantment you want. *IF* the piece of armor you wanted dropped as well. From what I've gathered, never checked myself, the drop rate for uniques among bosses is on average of 1/3ish. Which now puts that 4% down to almost 1%. Then comes the second enchantment. To make a long story short;<br>• 13 stackable enchants<br>• 7.6% of 1.3% is a 0.1% chance<br>• (Ignoring conditions) 7.6% of 0.1% is a 0.0076% chance.

This is like how enemy poison can stack on the player multiple times.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The lvl of the base gear is kept and the base gear lvl is lost. So make sure you use the lvl 49 gear. Love this idea so I hope it’s implemented in some way similar to the above ideas (including the idea of the original poster AND the ideas of other ppl after me) </p>\n\n<p>I CANT believe I was to first to respond to this awesome idea!!! </p>",
