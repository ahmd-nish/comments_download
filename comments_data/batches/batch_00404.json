They also would burn in lava, because not all Nether materials need to be inmune to fire or lava.<br><br><strong>Third, and the textures?

But Mojang team always find a form to fix problems, and for that I'm relaxed.<br><br><strong>Fourth, and the new Furnace?</strong><br><br>Well, this furnace would be exactly the same as a normal one, but with the advantage that it would be a Soul Furnace, a furnace that can smelt all smeltable items &amp; blocks, except food or minerals.

        "body": "<p>More on this with the new blast furnace all they have to do is add carbon for us to get steel. Since coal is already in the game that can be used as carbon to mix with iron and make steel.</p>\n<p>With the blast furnace, you put in coal (As the carbon) and combine it with a few pieces of iron to melt together and create Steel. From there you just use steel as if you would iron to create advanced weaponry and tools. Yes, this would replace iron gear and if anything iron stuff should a little weaker if it&nbsp;is eventually added. Things such as \"Flint and STEEL\" could be updated to be made with steel instead of iron. I believe steel will have a little more armor points than iron armor right now but instead of being really tough it will just have a ton of durability. It will be primarily superior to iron only in the fact that its durability is much higher. I believe that steel should be the opposite of golden gear by having a ton of durability but just be as efficient as iron tools and weapons. That is what will balance Steel out while not just having it as a useless addition.</p>\n<p>Steel being added would likely build the path for other alloys and ores to be added to the game such as bronze made of copper and tin. <strong>This could be used in the education edition</strong> to make people more easily understand metals and alloys on the periodic table too.&nbsp;</p>",

Could also apply small speed decrease, and perhaps weak poison when eating wearing armor. Dark grey ore lighter than coal.\n<br />Titanium, can only be found in certain biomes, about half way between iron and diamond in strength. Black ore, darker than coal.\n<br />Gallium, this ore can be found in small quantities in many biomes, but after being smelted and crafted into blocks, it will melt in about half of the biomes. It can be stored as blocks or like water depending on biome and y height. Ore has water effects like sponge except silver drips. Always liquid in nether. Light Grey ore different pattern.\n<br />Mercury, like gallium but always liquid, and if left in your inventory for several in-game days will begin applying poison effects. The duration is up to others for choice. Also you can't just throw it into a chest and then put it right back to cancel poison effects, they will only be canceled if you leave it out of your inventory for at least a day.\n<br />Uranium could be added, with a faint pulsing glow and poison effects after so many seconds within a few blocks of it, and death to player after about a minute of direct exposure. You can wear lead armor to carry it without injury. It would power redstone and melt ice.\n<br />All metal blocks should transmit redstone signal as long as they touch. Perhaps a stronger redstone signal could be added powerful enough to jump one block gaps of metal. It could also injure players as well.\n</p>",

It can be affected by the infinity enchantment, which means soul bows forever!!!! (Well technically until your bow runs out or you die and lose all your things)</p>",

        "body": "<p>Look, my original take on the spear and additions I made to the trident were too similar to what's here, so it got deleted, and I was told to move it to the similar post. Because I found several posts, I'm also gonna go over my problems with each of the original suggestions at the beginning of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I get that bamboo needs more use, but this isn't how spears should be made. Bamboos have been proven to be worth half that sticks are, so a spear made out of a bamboo would actually only be as long as half a sword. Plus, in order to make spears a viable weapon, they cant just be made to be so weak.</p>\n<p>Heres my take:</p>\n<p>Description: The&nbsp;spear can be used as both a ranged and melee weapon.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type: Combat</li>\n<li>Durability:&nbsp;125</li>\n<li>Renewable: Yes</li>\n<li>Stackable: No</li>\n<li>Sounds:&nbsp;Shoot (Twang is louder and longer.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Obtaining:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crafting: The spear is made from 2 sticks topped with flint. It has lowered durability due to the cheap materials it is made from. It can also be crafted by combining two broken spears to combine their durability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Melee - There are technically&nbsp;two ways to hit people with the spear.\n<ul>\n<li>Standard - Whacking someone with a spear in the same way you would a sword would only deal 4 damage, and take double durability.</li>\n<li>Charging - When running, the spear would be held in both hands, level with the target, and if you hit someone with it in this state, it is thrust forward and deals a high critical hit, about 8 or more damage. Critical hits are not rewarded for jump attacks. Jumping while sprinting actually negates the charging effect. If a player is sprinting, then suddenly switches to throw instead of melee, 5% more time is added to the pullback.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ranged - By using, the spear is pulled back, and when it is released, thrown far. Look, it's all the same deal as the trident, ok? It can even be thrown into the water and keep going, making it viable in as well as out of&nbsp;land.</li>\n<li>Dusting and tracking - The trident can be crafted with one glowstone dust to cast the spectral effect upon it. The first time it hits someone, they will be dealt with a very brief spectral effect, and the spear will go back to normal.</li>\n<li>Enchantments -&nbsp; Shown below.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Impaling [Levels - 5]: Known enchant. Damage is only added to charging and throwing.</li>\n<li>Ignition [Levels - 1]: Thrown spears ignite and deal fire damage to those it hits. The effect is lost in rain and water.</li>\n<li>Loyalty [Levels - 3]: Known enchant.</li>\n<li>Infinity [Levels - 1]: Known enchant.</li>\n<li>Unbreaking [Levels - 3]: Known enchant.</li>\n<li>Mending [Levels - 1]: Known enchant. This enchantment has +50% the effect on this weapon than it does on other weapons.</li>\n<li>Curse of Vanishing: Known enchant.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>In-Game Application</strong></em>: The spear itself as an item grants the ability to try out the mechanics of a duel melee-ranged weapon. The weapons very early accessibility is limited by its low durability and opportunity of use. There's also a sort of primitive theme to it. I don't suggest the use of iron spears to give it a very concrete and distinguished place in the game.</p>\n<p>As a weapon, it is made viable by the mechanics I've added to the core of it and the trident. If you care enough to enchant one, you must love the hit and run strategy of it enough to put more work into it. It may even be made more viable than the trident to some, as the Spear can be used in all situations, but the trident is better during storms and in water.</p>\n<p>My biggest point (pun not intended) to be made here was the charging aspect. Instead of jumping in order to obtain a critical hit, you would have to run at your opponent. The concept would also apply to the trident as well as the spear, with its normal damage being lowered, and the crit damage being raised. This might make the trident just as viable a weapon as a normal diamond sword, and encourages skill for reward.</p>\n<p>When charging, a trident is held outwards with only one hand, like a gladiator. Damage will also have to be adjusted for this weapon as well, maybe up to 10 or 11 damage when charging.</p>\n<p>As a final note, I would also like to suggest the idea that when loyalty is used in conjunction with mending, every time half of the spear or tridents durability has been renewed, the loyalty level goes up (capping at 3), as it becomes more loyal to the player. I'm not as attached to this idea, as it can be easily overruled by simply enchanting it better, but it's still worth pointing out here.</p>\n<p>Thank you for considering my suggestion. More to come.</p>\n<p>To the original poster, I apologize for hijacking your own post, but&nbsp;I wasn't given any choice. No seriously, I am really sorry.

        "body": "<p>I fully agree with Spears being able to skewer someone. However this item should be available in Flint, Iron, Gold and Diamond. Here is how think they should be implemented:</p>\n<p>1) Different materials do different levels of damage</p>\n<p>2) Different materials have different durability</p>\n<p>3) Enchantments are key. If it doesn't have a Sharpness like enchantment it wont be used</p>\n<p>4) It needs a new combat mechanic e.g. the Charge move. This could be an enchantment or just part of the weopon</p>\n<p>5) A certain level of fun should be attached to this item like the Crossbow shooting fireworks</p>\n<p>6) Being able to use a Shield and a Spear at the same time makes sense to me. Whie protected by the shield you shuld be able to at least poke your enemy and deal at least half of the normal damage. This combined with the Knockback enchantment might come in handy whan facicng stronger foes.</p>\n<p>Just some thoughts that I hope are helpful thanks for reading.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Right now, the comparator will output the ID of the disc inserted, which is not bad but also not really useful at the same time.</p>\n<p>My vision is the following:</p>\n<p>1) if the jukebox is not playing, powering it will cause the song to start playing if any disk is inserted<br>2) a comparator outputs signal strength according to how far the song has progressed (0 at the beginning, 15 when it is finished)<br>note: with 1 and 2 combined, you can already implement looping (just trigger the jukebox when the output reaches 15)<br>3) when the jukebox is playing a song, powering it will pause the track. the jukebox should remember where it left off and continue playing at that position, unless the disk is taken out.<br><br>This would allow for really good control over the music. Also, Jukeboxes should work with dispensers and hoppers to allow changing out discs automatically, but that is already proposed in another suggestion: <a href=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360028758251-Jukebox-hoppers-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360028758251-Jukebox-hoppers-</a></p>",

And while it does collect gold dust, I feel it would only be able to craft 1-4 nuggets at a time, making it take longer to fulfill its purposes which kinda feels un-needed with all due respect. Also I thought about it growing on Glowstone, but the fungus in real life only grows out of soil like substances, so I chose Nylium and Soul Soil, though that is an interesting idea. Also don't know about growing it with a lava bucket, perhaps there could be a way to grow it more realisticly on grass? But idk, it's supposed to be more exclusive to the Nether. Love your ideas and comment!</p>",

Have the nether gold veins be smaller (the size of diamond veins perhaps) while the nether gold ore blocks act as a seed and cause the fungus to grow off of it. Of course the fungus should then drop much less gold and experience, from 1 to 3 nuggets with a very rare fourth one seems good to me. Also, although the real fungus probably doesn't behave like this, it would be very interesting if the fungus spread in a root like structure rather than like grass. The root like structure would also make creating an efficient automatic farm for it a much more interesting problem to solve.</p>",

Though I did do some things for reason of course. The reason I chose nylium and soul soil is because nylium is made up of hyphae which is basically all the gold fungus is and uses to collect gold. Also if Mojang doesn't wanna choose this I would totally love to see it infused in nether gold ore as it would be very interesting, and could even have a unique name. Also I tried to keep the realism while still keeping it minecrafty, it all works like how it would except for the multiple nuggets and obvious gold sparkles in the hyphae of the Gold fungus. Think I might just edit this post with all your ideas added though I am worried about the current pandemic and it stopping post approvals by a long shot. Thanks for all the feedback as I really look forward to more and hope to see Mojang choose creative ideas such as this.</p>",
