        "body": "<p>Or you can accept that the changes that will happen won't be that crucial to the already existing generation of the seed; the biomes that are being added are cave biomes, so they won't mess up with the surface biomes, besides making the surface and underground blend better. The new Mountain biomes might do so, but they are usually 2000 blocks apart each, and given the split of the update their placement where they replace other biomes is probably temporary. I'd say it is likely that they would incorporate them better into the biome generation.The biomes might definitely change up a little bit, but it shouldn't be too big of a deal. Strongholds and Mineshafts generate in essentially the same spots, just usually lower down. Dungeons will be the most affected, changing spots completely, though other Dungeons usually generate somewhere around where you'd expect them to be previously. I see your logic, but the reason I'm being so critical is because it would be extremely complex and performance heavy to simulate an entire world without even opening it, or to lock a certain generation algorithm into such a simple file. From the technical side, this could be a nightmare. A much better solution to your problem would be to either accept how it is, or just give us the ability to load up older versions on Bedrock Edition, and I'd honestly like the second option.</p>",

This makes the entire category of skins for mine coin less useful  and profitable for the creators. Each of the users in our household laments the inability to hide armor.
