Mojang opted to remove fireflies from the game entirely. Mojang is adding Armadillos as a mob in the game, with a special drop that can be used to make \"armor for dogs\". Armadillos are animals that can be found in southern states in the USA, such as Texas and Florida. Now, armadillos are indeed adorable animals and adding armor for dogs to Minecraft would be a useful feature for some. However, Armadillos are dangerous for humans to come in contact with. They are carriers of disease, especially Leprosy. They are so effective at carrying Leprosy, in fact, that even eating cooked armadillo meat has been known to transmit the disease to humans. Parts of an Armadillo corpse transmit the disease just as well as Live Armadillos do themselves. Adding Armadillos to the game Minecraft would help encourage children to chase after and touch armadillos and armadillo corpses in real life, greatly increasing the chances for a leprosy outbreak, since leprosy also transmits well between humans, and children have less developed immune system, increasing the disease risk any further. Mojang, please do not add the Armadillo and substitute in another animal that can serve the same purpose, like a Desert Tortoise, which is a much lower disease risk and has a hard shell much like an Armadillo!</p>",

The simple answer to how weak the armor is, is just increasing the protection, but I have another idea. I know this might be a long shot, but adding enchants to animal armors would be such a game changer. At the bare minimum, protection would be nice. As a trade off to this, the armors could now have durability. Mending armor could work by just holding it.</p>\n\n<p>2. Please add armor trims to the dog armor, or at the very least, make them dyeable. And while on that topic, it would be nice if horse armor was updated as well with netherite + armor trims. On the topic of dyes and customization as a whole, this would be a perfect opportunity to add cauldron parity to Java.</p>\n\n<p>As a whole I would update the AI of wolves, since they are notorious for falling off cliffs and running into lava.</p>\n\n<p>Armadillos:</p>\n\n<p>The design is cute, but as many have pointed out, the concept looked better.

I understand that it might be useful to add a feature to the brush, but perhaps the armadillo could let the scutes fall off naturally after a while, maybe even that brushing them would speed up the process?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, now that there is multiple scute items in the game, please rename \"Scute\" to \"Turtle Scute\".</p>\n<p>Lastly, please change back the eye placement to the side of the head, right now it looks quite weird and more like a mouse, and perhaps make the armadillo a bit more brown, I think it looked better in the concept art.</p>\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read, much love to the team!</p>",

You have to trade with villagers to get anywhere if you don't want to spend months just to get enchanted netherite tools.

Your new features lack both reason and depth.</p>\n<p>Let's demonstrate this with your dog armor: I don't want my dogs to die. I want them to come on adventures, and maybe occasionally help with an enemy. I want them to follow me around and be good doggos. Not as soldiers, just pets.</p>\n<p>I can't do that if one creeper explosion or misstep into lava will kill my dog. I love my dogs and <em>don't want them to die.</em> This armor&nbsp;(which I <em>hope</em> is just a rough draft) is exactly what I predicted you would implement as soon as it was announced: The kind of armor that might let a dog survive <em>one </em>additional hit, and nothing more. So... completely useless.</p>\n<p>The problem you need to solve is: People keep their dogs at home all the time because taking dogs with you is an unrecoverable death sentence. <strong>Make it so dogs can survive,</strong> or don't bother with dog armor at all.

As a bunch other commenters said, giving the Wolf Armor some customization, such as dyes or Armor Trims goes a long way in making it more popular, especially because it would make the feature less isolated, and therefore tie in better with the rest of the game.</p>\n<p>2. Also suggested by a lot of commenters: Enchantable animal armor. So not just Wolf Armor, but Horse Armor and maybe Saddles too. This would allow for much more freedom in providing specific resistances for your animals, and could even open the path to some really cool new enchantments that are exclusive to animal armor.</p>\n<p>3. This is something I haven't seen anyone really suggest yet: Let Wolf Armor be reinforced with Netherite, or just include it in the recipe in the first place and buff the armor as a result. Reinforcing could for example happen by using a Smithing Table with a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template, this would also tie in nicely with Armor Trims. Furthermore, Diamond Horse Armor could also have an upgrade to Netherite Horse Armor.</p>\n<p>4. Last but not least: Also as others suggested, improvements to the AI of the wolves. Even with Netherite Wolf Armor with the best enchantments, if the wolf just goes into all kinds of dangerous situations by itself, it will still only be a matter of time until it takes too much damage, so making it a bit smarter in its movement, on top of the other suggestions, will definitely make taking wolves with you more popular.</p>",

In the trailers for the armadillo, the eyes were on the side of the head, and it looked great as it was; in addition, as another user stated, armadillos are prey animals with outwards-facing eyes to see predators. With the eyes now on top of the head, though, the armadillo looks strange and derpy.</li>\n<li>Make the ears slightly smaller. Although having larger ears could make the armadillo look cuter in a way, I believe having them smaller makes more sense, as real-life armadillos have small, slick ears to tuck away when they roll up.</li>\n<li>Have its head hide when it rolls up. In real life, armadillos will roll up when frightened and, importantly, cover their head. With its head sticking out, it seems like silliness was prioritized much more than the vital characteristics of the armadillo.</li>\n<li>Strengthen the wolf armor. Despite the wolf armor being as strong as diamond horse armor, a wolf will still die in 1 hit to a creeper. Most voters likely expected the armor to fix issues with their wolves dying, yet it doesn't really achieve that. Perhaps also fix the wolf's AI to help this issue as well.</li>\n<li>Rename scute to \"turtle scute.\" Armadillos drop \"armadillo scute,\" so turtles should drop \"turtle scute\" to prevent confusion.</li>\n<li>Keep armadillos rolled up when hit. Currently, the armadillos run when hit. Since armadillos roll up to protect themselves, it makes sense for them to prevent damage by rolling up instead, kind of like a shulker.</li>\n</ul>",

This is an opportunity to give a lot more depth to wolves, pets that have been in the game since nearly the start, and that shouldn't be squandered. Having different tiers of Wolf Armour depending on what you craft it with (along with the scutes), more ways to customize the armour's aesthetic, and possibly even general updates to the pet AI (such as adding a \"wander\" mode to tamed pets to allow them to organically wander your base, instead of forcing them to either follow you or sit in the same spot forever) are all features I was really hoping to see with this addition. I voted for the armadillo and wolf armour in hopes that we could see wolves and other pets finally get some more use in this modern age of Minecraft where they've mostly fallen by the wayside, and I still hope we see that. As it is now, they still can't survive one point blank creeper blast, so my wolves are still staying safe at home :(</p>",

The scutes are easy to farm, which is nice.</p>\n\n<p>Armadillo can be more common in savannahs, as they're hard to find. They can also spawn on badlands. I like how it drops scutes periodically, allowing new players to discover the wolf armor feature easily. On the other end, turtle scutes are almost impossible to get without looking at wikis, and they're too difficult to farm. I like unique gear like turtle helms, there should be more such things in the future, but they're just not discoverable for new players.</p>\n\n<p>The wolf armor looks excellent so far. But there's several things that prevent me from taking wolves on adventures. Having to constantly feed it after combat makes wolves a huge burden to bring, not like the regenerating horses/axolotls. Give life regen to wolf armor! Animal armor should also be enchantable, wolves still die easily to creepers and fire. Diamond horse armor is bad and they're only as good as gold-armor players, but at least horses can get 15 hearts. Don't add durability on animal armor as it'd get annoying.</p>\n\n<p>Add a way to dye and remove wolf armor with shears, allowing personalized customization. Wolves all look the same, and adding different dog breeds like huskies will make this update an instant success. Overall, wolf armor is an excellent addition to vanilla, many content creators would love to use these on let's plays!</p>",

Armadillo Scutes should be obtained through baby Armadillo growth. </strong></p>\n<p>For consistency to players and encouraging more engagement with the mob, it should function similar to Turtle Scutes. There are two ways I see this could be done. A:&nbsp; When a baby <strong>Armadillo</strong> grows and first becomes an adult you can use a brush on anywhere from 1-4 times depending on the <strong>Armadillo,&nbsp;</strong>(Or it could work where you use the brush once and the drop rate is random) There should also be a brush animation for this and perhaps a very quick cooldown. B: When a baby <strong>Armadillo</strong> grows it drops a scute just like the turtles do.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Armadillo's should be more dynamic when rolled up.</strong></p>\n<p>When a <strong>Armadillo</strong> rolls into a ball while its scared perhaps it should have a chance of slowly or extremely quickly rolling away from the area, if nothing else this could just be a rare occurrence as a easter egg (since real life armadillos don't roll away). Aside from this, when a <strong>Armadillo </strong>rolls up there should be a very quick and brief in-between animation as it starts to curl up. One minor thing that also could be considered is making them un-moveable when rolled up and perhaps even solid like a block.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Wolf Armor expression and buffing.<br></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Wolf Armor </strong>should be dye-able. Also, trial chambers could have <strong>Wolf Armor</strong> upgrade-templates/enchantments for fire and lava if you want to encourage people to take their wolves to mining. As currently I feel most would keep there wolves home for this and more,<strong> </strong>it is strong but needs more options.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

(They are scavengers). If you kill an armadillo in real life that means you broke through the scute, so it would be useless for armor anyway.\n<br />Using the brushes like the gentle approach sometimes needed for pink fairy armadillo pets is nice, though maybe only after being in water (to mimic the humidity required). Shedding when startled would have also been appropriate for some species.</p>\n\n<p>Dog armor is hard. Going historically you have plate/chain mail that made dogs slow but able to grab onto horse rider's legs and pull them off, hunting armor that was leather and lightweight/maneuverable, or metal covered in spikes to rip into other animals and people.

As Armadillos are practically poisonous to people and wolves, they shouldn’t be added for the same reason as Fireflies weren’t added. Adding the Crab would also benefit every Minecraft player, even those who voted for the Armadillo. It’s a bit unfair that players had to choose between a game changing mob, the Crab, or a mob that gave players an item that a lot (not all) really wanted in the game. The Crab, as it helps players build, has a lot more uses than the Armadillo, which only some players will use fully. I hope people understand my point </p>",

It doesn’t look right when it’s head and feet stick out when it’s rolled up and it’s head is almost fully submerged when it’s in the water. It makes the Armadillo look like it can breathe underwater. Also, some of its noises sound horrible.</p>\n<p>I don’t really like the look of the wolf armour either. It makes my wolf look like it’s going mountain biking or skateboarding, which I don’t like, and it doesn’t make me want to take it out to fight monsters at all. I thought that a benefit with wolf armour would be that you could tell the difference between each wolf with dyes or armour trims but you can’t even do that with it.</p>\n<p>I’m unimpressed with both. Like I said earlier, it could be because I wanted the Crab instead. I still think that the Crab and the Penguin should be added as well. 42% voted for the Armadillo but 58% didn’t vote for it.

        "body": "<p>When it comes to brushing Armadillos for scutes, something feels off. The current system seems imbalanced and doesn't quite make sense. However, I believe there are ways to improve it. Perhaps making the brushing process take longer and adding an animation could make it feel more rewarding. On the other hand, removing the scute brushing feature altogether might be the best option. As it stands now, it feels like a trade-off between brushes and scutes, rather than a natural, enjoyable process. Although I do appreciate the fact that Armadillos drop scutes over time, it seems redundant to keep one when I can acquire enough scutes for my wolves by spam-brushing ten of there biome. By making these changes, the process of obtaining scutes could be more engaging and balanced, making it a more enjoyable experience for everyone involved.</p>",

As in the 2 mobs the donkey 🫏 is the mule when asleep. For players who have many items in their inventory, store the items in the chest in the tamed wolves. When we tamed the wolf and had the chest in my hand, the name will be put in the chest and we will remove the agent and press on it, it will show the lives or resistance if he has the armor, just take it out without needing the scissors ✂️ then we will just remove the The wolf dies and he drops the chest if he has items saved and he drops the items we put in. So what do you think of this idea of mine, I hope you like it and add it to Minecraft.</p>",
