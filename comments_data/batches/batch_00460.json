Alternatively, you can put it in a crafting bench along with 1-8 pieces of wool and craft it down, this destroys the spindle but turns each piece of wool into 3 strings.  (And like making a boat, it can be almost out of durability when you do that, so use it on live sheep till it's almost worn out, the spin up a pile of wool-blocks to maximize the yield-per-spindle!)</p>",

I always sort of saw Minecraft as a post apocalyptic world that only returned to the old was out of necessity. May be that is because I first played Minecraft with Tekkit then sort of grew into Vanilla. To me the past was always full of more tech I suppose. That is the beauty of this game isn't it it is however you see it. It is what ever you want it to be.&nbsp;<br><br>I consed that the cast iron skillet wasn't popularized until the advent of the kitchen stove in the 19th century but other metal pans were used in ancient Mesopotamia so it doesn't necessarily not fit into your vision of Minecraft IMO.</p>\n<p>I would like to know what parts of the mechanics you liked and didn't like. If you have any thoughts as to why you feel the way you do (like you did by telling me that the pan didn't fit the theme of the other weapons) That would be very much appreciated! <br><br>Thanks again for your input.&nbsp; I appreciate you taking the time to offer it!</p>",

I also liked the fighting mechanics, of being able too knock people back. As I believe skillets should be purely for cooking. Even if it was post-apocalypse style in Minecraft, this isn't Pubg as to have a skillet as a weapon. The idea of a bludgeoning weapon with high knockback is great, however, maybe a mace or a club would better fit the style of minecraft.</p>",

I think I speak for everyone in that we'd all love more food in the game, but its hard to justify adding any of it. However if its harder to farm certain crops in certain temperatures, then each biome can have its own \"cuisine\" so to speak. I don't think it would be too hard to add a system like this without needing to adjust things too much.</p>\n<p>Adverse weather like heat or frost would slow down crop growth, and very hot or very cold weather could even wilt crops not hydrated. If there's a heatwave, soil dries up and water only hydrates soil adjacent to the water block. Just determine the rate of adverse weather affecting the crops based on exposure to the Sky level, and I think that's all you'd need.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Well...I say that's all you'd need, but you'd need the weather too. Its obviously not that simple, but I think the effort would be well worth it!</p>",
