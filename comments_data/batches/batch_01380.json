They could spawn in the mountains in an outpost, but would look like a large tree with a nest on top, with Eagles as their pets. They would attack all hostile mobs like zombies or pillagers, with either swords or for range attacks a spear that could be thrown. Players could then befriend them with a random number of emeralds or something. Then they would follow the player and attack mobs or could be ordered to guard a spot, which they would patrol around. We could have armies and would make castles more lively with actual guards that could follow orders. There weapons could be out of stone mostly with rare iron ones, and their armor out of leather, so you could dye it different colors. What if they were added on the mountain update.</p>",

However, no mob attacks its owner in Minecraft, meaning that Eagles should be able to breed without taming them. I thought of two ways to tame them and breed them separately. First, the Eagle should be fed to enter love mode (We can decide the diet, hunts and/or gifts later). Afterwards, we can use the idea of needing a leather glove to tame them. I think that after the Eagle enters love mode, the player should select the hunting glove in his hotbar, or have it in his offhand slot, and interact with the Eagle. The Eagle should perch on the player’s arm/glove, and if it flies within a certain amount of time and brings back a hunt/gift, it is tamed. If it lands to the ground and moves away/flies but doesn’t bring anything back, it’s not. The second way is the exact same, except that it doesn’t have to enter love mode for the player to interact with it and tame it. Of course, if two Eagles enter love mode, they breed through laying in their perches or nests.</p>",

That's because all tamed mobs can be forced to sit, which is basically for preventing them to move unless attacked, so you can prevent them from hunting without hoodies if you want. We may choose that the glove loses durability as the player hunts, and there should also be a cool down before it can gift the player again. The hunting process should be done simply through a loot table. It means the Eagles just generate items and give them to you, similar to cats. It’d be better than them actually killing mobs, as the mobs they hunt might not be around, or it might not give items as valuable as what cats give, which might break the purpose of the mob. They could additionally kill certain mobs, like rabbits, on sight separate from the “hunting” mechanism that uses the interaction. This is a good compromise, because they can actually kill mobs for you when standing and also provide special hunt related loot upon interaction, just as if it had a successful hunt, regardless of mob availability. Then they should only require open space to fly around, otherwise the \"hunt\" fails, nothing is brought back. I think the gifts from the “hunting” process and the list of mobs they attack on sight is something Mojang would decide. I heard many great ideas, though.</p>",

That’s because they‘d have the kind of bond where they are tempted by the player feeding them and trained for a purpose in return. Same way as wolves are tempted by bones and trained to offer services to expect more, eventually loving the humans themselves for that. In Minecraft, they’re not exactly trained, but they still offer the service of attacking mobs for the player. Just like Eagles would bring gifts and loot certain mobs. After thinking, hoodies are unnecessary for the process of attacking mobs but can be an essential part for the gift giving mechanism to work. Perhaps you must put the hoodie on its eyes before you use your glove on it to make it perch and must take it of its head through your inventory for it to fly and eventually bring you something. If you’re taming it and the attempt fails, it should land to the ground after you remove the hoodie while it’s perching on the glove. Now we (or Mojang) should decide with or against the hoodie, though!</p>",

I would like to also suggest the creation of a drowned horse, which, on top of just looking cool, would be like a halfway stage between skeleton and zombie horses. I'd suggest that it would have half the health of the skeleton horse and, like the drowned, would be able to properly swim instead of just sinking as skeleton and zombie horses do. As for natural spawning I feel like perhaps not every undead should have their own mount, but they could be found around/in a new sunken stable structure. Also obviously if a zombie horse drowns. I hope you lovely folks at the Mojang team take these ideas into consideration.</p>",

Normal and husk zombie horses should spawn in zombie villages and during zombie sieges with zombies riding them wearing an iron helmet while wielding an iron weapon/tool, like skeleton horse jockeys. However, unlike skeleton horses, they should burn in daylight with the exception of the husk horse unless ridden by an helmet wearing zombie. Also, like zombies, they should undergo the husk-to-zombie-to-drowned conversion when drowning. However, due to most of them being able to burn in daylight, they should have certain abilities to make them useful. For example, the husk horse should have some form of fire protection (like the armor enchantment; would be useful for traveling through the Nether), normal zombie horses should run faster and jump higher than the average horse during nighttime but will suffer slowness and the inability to be commanded to jump like a normal horse during daytime, and drowned horses should be able to swim in water like a drowned but lose the ability be commanded to jump. Like skeleton horses, they should have less health than a normal horse but more health than a skeleton horse (since they have more skin to work with).</p>",

I suggest rather making the hitbox larger or make them move more predictable cause as is it's an absolute pain to use anything other than a bow.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Spawning range- with other mobs there's a minimum range they can spawn away from a player but I have them spawn within 10 blocks of me almost always. So make them spawn at the same minimum distance as all the other hostile mobs.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Noise- they are very quiet, if not the quietest hostile mob(excluding creepers) so before they attack they should have a sound like a screech or something like the creeper has a fissile.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Phantoms are a very unique mob and I'd like to see them optimized for maximum intricacy for minimum stress, as is however I believe they need some tweaking.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Hate is exactly the word that is needed here. A community voted for it and a programmer sat down and CREATED a mob that is annoying and takes the fun out of this game? Remove them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here is some feedback. Remove Phantoms. The game is about adventure and exploring, not running home every three days to sleep, or carrying a bed with me. And don't get me wrong, at first I dealt with them. But when 8 of them spawned (I know the cap is 6, they just kept spawning and coming at me once I destroyed one) and proceeded to kill me far from home. Now (luckily) I retrieved my stuff but lost 32 levels of experience because I was essentially Phantom spammed/zerged. Don't fix the spawn cap. Don't make them weaker (I was in full iron which still surprises me that they hit so hard). Remove them. They are the worst Mob ever created. and that's saying a lot considering how much I hate the Ghast. and I mean that across all games I have played. I was on the Xbox one for this \"adventure\". I will not return unless they are removed.</p>",

The classic mobs that you will encounter on the way are more of a threat really.</p>\n<p>They only really become a major nuisance when they spawn around your base, or over something you're currently building. Any other mobs would be just as annoying if they spawned at you while you're build filling the place with torches doesn't prevent them from spawning. I read that just lying down on a bed will prevent them from spawning for a while, but then it won't stop them from circling overhead if an insomniac player happened to pass by (I think at this point you could blame the insomniac).</p>\n<p>I don't think they break the game. They don't really need any major adjustments or outright removal. As of 1.13.2, they're actually very noisy, and will telegraph their synchronized dive attack.</p>",

A lot of the issues people seem to have with the mob is that they are unwilling to adapt their play style to avoid the mobs. It is not hard to carry a bed around, as they are fairly cheap to make and easy to destroy and move on with. Equally having to sleep one night in every three doesn't seem like a meaningful issue at all. At the point in the game where players are trying to mob farm, most players are probably not troubled by the regular mobs, so adding in phantoms as an extra challenge is a good idea in my opinion. In fact, there are not enough flying mobs in the game, so phantoms are refreshingly unique and pose an interesting challenge to overworld players.</p>",

Thus I don't encounter phantoms.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, I find that some of the issues with phantoms are trivial and more focussed on people's stubbornness. The first of these is that it limits the ability to construct massive structures. It would take at most 30 seconds to place a bed, sleep in it, then destroy it again and carry on building. And this only has to be done every third night. You don't lose any more time by sleeping; the ten minutes of night you 'skip' by sleeping has no effect on the real world. So I do not see that as an issue.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to exploring, ok taking beds does change your spawn, so you have to decide whether to take beds and risk spawning miles from your base, or not taking beds and risk being killed by phantoms. As this is not my play style, I am not the most qualified to judge, but it seems to me that the risk of death by phantoms is greater than the risk of dying by any other means and spawning miles away.</p>",

Or, if that is too difficult for you, sleep every third night. You don't lose XP by sleeping, and mobs will still spawn the next night.

The only drop the have is as much as useless to most normal players.</p>\n<p>2. Having to sleep through the night, go mine or stay inside only to get rid of phantoms shouldn't even be a thing. Every other common mob in minecraft can be avoided by a simple 2-block high wall/elevated terrain or hole. Not being able to go outside during the cozy night on top of your house for example because phantoms will come and knock you around forever driving you mad is not a \"feature\" suitable for minecraft.</p>\n<p>3. There are NO command-based ways to get rid of them.</p>\n<p>4. They're extremely unbalanced and take ages to kill because you only have time to hit them once each time they dive down at you. Most of the time they WILL hit you as they CAN'T MISS. Unlike skeleton arrows, phantoms can turn as quickly as the player and WILL ALWAYS hit the player if the player doesn't hit them quickly enough. They're practically unavoidable as they're both faster than the player and can fly out of the players reach in a second, and all the player can do is to wait for the phantom to attack.</p>\n<p>5. They make awfully loud noises that are both irritating and ruins the atmosphere of minecraft, so just staying inside wont keep you from being bombarded with phantoms circling around your house hissing and screaming constantly.</p>",

The <strong>Phantom</strong> mob has <strong>not</strong> made the gameplay fun and exciting for the family anymore.<strong> I would like to see the mob's relevance significantly REDUCED. </strong></p>\n<p>Originally from Java Edition in my \"day\". Night time was about dangers of hostile mobs that come about on the ground. Creepers, spiders, skeletons, etc. They have a decent speed which a player can FLEE from. Not the Phantom. It is FASTER than a minecart and even with speed potions, outrunning the mob isn't easy.</p>\n<p>Some will say \"go sleep\". What made minecraft FUN and exciting was for a person to be OUT at night and accept risks. NOT be <strong>bound to a BED</strong>. This causes REDUCED exploring and does NOT teach young people a confidence. Especially during nightfall. I play hitscan heroes in popular game titles and I have to admit that this mob would be rather difficult for a younger person to hit and it is. Because at the angle they attack, how difficult it is to aim for, and the fact that the mob ONLY drops a minimal amount of XP and 1 useful material for potion crafting. Which most young people do NOT do.</p>\n<p>Counterplay to Walking mobs is one thing. Flying mobs has much greater dynamic.</p>\n<p>Phantom mobs also send a NEGATIVE MESSAGE to people. It depicts itself as a BAT. I played Castlevania back in the NES days and Bats from that game such as the one after courtyard level. (1st floor castle boss) made for a Scary experience for me, when I was a child. I can imagine that for a YOUNG person this is not for fun for them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It is a game of exploration - you can roam the world, day or night, discovering the locations that minecraft has to offer. However phantoms make this nearly impossible - within 3 nights of roaming there are suddenly a lot of them in the sky. They cannot be outran - the only options are to sleep or to hide. Hiding? Removes your ability to explore at night, thus meaning there's no point. The alternative - sleeping. The issue with this is that you either leave a trail of beds in your wake or you destroy your despawn point constantly. Either way, this is frustrating because the instant this happens you lose your respawn location at your base, and it gets reset to somewhere either random or back at spawn.</p>\n<p>This doesn't even begin to cover the difficulties that they cause while building and on servers which don't apply the gamerule, however I'm running out of characters to use.

Sleep needed a unique reason why we SHOULD aside from passing the night.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Further more, just cause you other phantom defenders attack their words of speech may kinda make you seem overly judgemental, and taking their freedom of speech.</p>\n<p>And lastly, I may sound like a hypocrite, but shame on the guy who swore on this post, as this Is a Minecraft website, and you may make overprotective parents not wanting kids to play the game.</p>\n<p>Overall, while everyone has their opinion, I have my word: Mojang Is Against most afk farms, and WE voted for these. So calm your butts and just play Minecraft. Doinsomnia exists to help servers, the only normal flying mob that's hostile Is being hated By Ignorant kids... You hate phantoms, Why don't you hate creepers? Again, It ain't just mojang, we voted for them on minecon 2018(?)</p>\n<p>Go spread your hate on reddit If your so salty. Ain't my fault, ain't mojang's. Sure they could use a slightly larger hitbox, but they essentially make sleeping useful.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Edit: Im not really trying to be rude, nor' was I mad at the time, I was trying to rant about the absolute Nut-city I was seeing here. I saw some suggestions to make phantoms easy, so there's that too.</p>",

In order to disable phantoms you need to have cheats enabled and then type the following:<br><br>/gamerule doInsomnia false<br><br>This does disable phantom generation for both single player maps and servers. However, again, it requires that cheats be enabled. If the world was created without cheats it would require an external program to turn them back on.<br><br>This means that the option of disabling phantoms requires the use of cheats or mods, whereas disabling all mobs simply requires changing to peaceful mode. That just doesn't make sense to me. This should be an option within the GUI of single player or a server setting.<br><br>Other comments would commonly say that we don't have to sleep - just touch a bed - and, well, this is true. You can carry a bed around and every 3 nights just drop it somewhere, get in, then get out, and continue. Kind of tedious though, and for skyblock maps it's usually a long while because I have the ability to make a bed.<br><br>That just leaves death. The thing is though one shouldn't be required to die just to make a mob go away.&nbsp;<br><br>Now, others have pointed out very good alternatives to removing the phantom outright, and I'd have to agree with them. Making it spawn in some other way, or not spawning in the light, would help. They can already spawn during the day if during a thunderstorm and at light level of 7 or less, so tie them to that light level.<br><br></p>",

That way regular players don't need to constantly sleep to avoid them, and players who want the membrane will have an event where they can get them. This event can effectively disable sleep for that night, it could be called \"the sleepless night\" and phantoms can show up during this. The event can be somewhat rare but spawn more than just 2-3 phantoms so that players who want the items can get them. Another reason this method would be way better is that players who haven't slept in a while won't suddenly be caught off guard by phantoms. They will see an announcement that says it's a sleepless night and will know what's about to come.</p>",

Minecraft isn’t supposed to be a stressful game (as far as I know) and this is really out of place.\n<br />Time to kill: Phantoms take way too long to kill if you don’t have a really strong weapon, and if you miss because the hitbox only consists of the head. This makes it unnecessarily hard for minimum rewards.\n<br />Rewards: For defeating these somewhat difficult mobs, you get minimal experience and an item that only does two things, one of which was repairing the Elytra, which Leather used to do. This takes away from Leather’s uses, as Leather isn’t good for very many things. The other is Slow Falling Potions but most people forget those exist anyway.\n<br />Preventing creativity:\n<br />Phantoms always come and attack you whenever you’re trying to build or adventure at night. This forces you to go to sleep, which is counterproductive and I’d much rather be building than wasting time sleeping.\n<br />Damage: the amount of damage they deal is very unbalanced for a mob that attacks in packs.\n<br />Those are the reason the Phantom is a bad gameplay mechanic.</p>",

Go play Minecraft Dungeons, there’s a pet Phantom you can get in that game if you get it during special events.\n<br />“HeRE’s wHY yOUr WrONG…”\n<br />Instead of providing helpful reasons for why Phantoms improve the game (spoiler alert: they don’t, stop living a lie), they tell you “JuST SlEep” or “jUSt uSE CaTS”, which doesn’t tell you why the Phantom improves the game, it just tells you things to avoid it. This doesn’t help your case at all.\n<br />“BuT YoU nEed it FoR ElYTra RePAIrs and SLoW FaLling PoTIoNS!”\n<br />First of all, Elytra could be repaired with Leather previously. Don’t like that? Well, cats can give you Phantom Membranes as a gift when you go to sleep. This encourages players to sleep anyway, so they can stockpile Phantom Membranes. Also, can’t remember what the other use was.., oh right, Slow Falling potions. Slow Falling potions are so forgettable and nobody uses them.\n<br />“TuRN OfF DoInsomnia!”\n<br />For a Java player, there’s no issue. However, players playing on Bedrock (which is the majority of players) can’t do this without enabling cheats. This prevents you from getting achievements, and this isn’t fair to Bedrock players who just want to play the game untainted and get achievements. I know, I know, you Java players don’t care about Bedrock players because you’re “better”\n<br />This is my counter-counterargument.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Love this idea but it would be cool if that when you are destroying the nest soldier ants come to attack you while the queen escapes with workers carrying brood. It would also be epic to see different types of ants (fire, leaf cutters, bullet ants, etc) and if their stats depend on what type of ant they are example: bullet ants do most damage while leaf cutters don’t do as much. It would also be cool if you could see little tunnels in the farms and nest blocks. If this gets added I would love to see it come to java and bedrock because me and my cousins would love to play with the little guys. The only thing is that it would lag a lot so to fix that I thought that old colonies would die when the queens would fly off to start a new nest and also the colonies wouldn’t produce a lot of ants. Anyway back to more ideas! The ants could pick up dropped items and when they do you could see them with the item wobbling in the ants mandibles and that the ants would attack other colonies.\n<br />Those are my ideas and I hope they add ants as they would be really fun to see</p>",

        "body": "<p>Ants: can have a colony in grass and dirt blocks ranging from 1x1 blocks to 5x5 blocks. queen ants usually hide out unless it is time for their nuptial flight (as you said, around every 5-10 days) they lay eggs, and if you happen to encounter one you can catch it in a jar, but the jar has durability that goes down the longer you keep the ant in the jar. If durability reaches 0, the queen ant dies. if you have an ant farm, ants will very rarely yield items (commonly items like dirt, but more rarely they may yield a low level metal such as a piece of iron ore), the chances of this increasing with the amount of ants in the farm (increases gradually). Worker ants behavior depend on the species. Colonies spawn with 1-5 workers, similar to beehives.</p>\n<p>Carpenter Ant: will pick items that are considered food items (rotten flesh, raw meats, apples, etc.) and deliver it to their queen. they are Neutral unless you attack one or break one of their colony blocks (see paragraph 1). they are very weak. Other than this they are quite boring.</p>\n<p>Fire Ant: Super aggressive, will attack anything and they do more damage than most other ants. They kill animals and bring the drops back to their colony.</p>\n<p>Army Ant: Super aggressive and do not have nests. Instead, they raid other nests and kill all the ants, and steal their eggs to eat. They also attack everything else, like fire ants, but do slightly more damage.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Sugar Ant: Neutral mobs that only attack you if you break one of their colony blocks, and they run away if you hit them. They pick up fruit and sugar and are extremely weak.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh yeah, and if ants from different colonies meet, they will fight.</p>",

Being able to swim through it better with this potion makes a lot of sense and really connects well with the mob -- just don't forget to put on that Fire Resistance potion!<br><br>One thing I would suggest changing is its neutral behavior. I think they should be aggressive to almost every creature in the Nether, especially if they already have a dislike for a few. Their behavior could be more about territory? Either way the Nether is a harsh place, and they would probably not treat you as a welcomed guest.<br><br>Lastly, they should also be able to move quicker of they are walking on magma blocks, to give some more neat functionality to this mob.<br><br>Overall it's a really well made idea, and I would be more than happy to see this be in the base game.</p>",

Some people may have been on the fence about it and then heard a point that persuaded them, but everyone was doing that. I didn't even know which Youtubers were voting for which mob until I opened Twitter to vote, so I guarantee that Dream didn't influence my vote (for the glow squid). We have 2 kinds of cow and 3 kinds of illager (not to mention, the iceologer would certainly end up being worse than the phantom), so if only 1 could get in this update, I'd want it to be the most unique one (this coming from someone who has wanted mooblooms for a while, pretty much since I saw Minecraft Earth).</p>",

They could spawn rarely in forests, and be more common in mountainous terrain. Neutral, (like polar bears), unless attacked, or if you get too near their young. A bear den could be a cool idea too. As for unique mechanics... again, Mojang seems to avoid incentives to hunt real world species besides livestock.</p>\n<p>Instead, bears could harvest and eat sweet berries, or maybe have some unique interactions with bees- trying to steal their honey, but possibly provoking them in the process. Even cooler, maybe you could tame bears/polar bears somehow, in order to ride them as a powerful mount akin to a ravager, with some sort of attack... or even find armor somehow? (Honestly, armored polar bears are just the coolest.)</p>",

        "body": "<p>I like the idea of sloths, but I think that they should be added differently. They spawn in subareas of jungles where it rains a lot (rainforests). They climb along trees and eat leaves. If you break a rainforest leaf, there is a chance it will give you a cecropia leaf that can breed sloths. When breeded, their baby crawls on a parent's back until it grows up. They are very slow, and they can either be three-toed or two-toed. They are neutral mobs that will only attack you if you punch it. They should have 10-15 health points. If you can put a lead on a baby sloth or attract it with a cecropia leaf before it can crawl onto it's parent's back, it will be tamed, and will crawl along the floor slowly, following you. If it catches up, it will climb on your back and hug you. Sloths will only drop leaves. The cecropia leaf is poisonous, but can make a potion of slowness. When a tamed baby sloth grows up, it will still be tamed. You can \"sit\" a tamed sloth, or make it fall asleep. When you do so, it will climb onto a wall if it is two or less blocks away from it. They can be two-toed or three-toed sloths. When climbing a tree, there is a 50% chance the sloth will fall asleep. They are bad fighters, and if they are attacked, they will hit you, but it only does one heart. Like llamas, they will hit you as many times as you hit them. If a sloth sees you kill a baby sloth, it will attack until you are dead and will do two hearts rather than one.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I really liked these ideas! Just a few notes:<br><br>- Since the release of netherrite in the nether update, i don't think it is very unreasonable to put tough silk armor as tough as diamond armor.<br><br>- Also, use the smithing table to upgrade leather to tough silk instead of anvil, it is already used for the netherrite anyway and it would make more sense.<br><br>- Endoths could just be called Endermoths.<br><br>- Instead of red eyes, I guess having them drop ender pearls and using eyes of ender for the googles would make more sense. You could have something like \"mite excretion\" or something like that to craft together with the eyes and leather (maybe take away the leather and use string instead would make more sense i n my opinion), so you would still have to get endermites for them.<br><br>- Also, paralysing effect sounds really similar to weakness, so why not have that instead? For what I remember the only mob that casts weakness on the player is the Witch, so it is cool to have other mobs that can do it too.</p>",
