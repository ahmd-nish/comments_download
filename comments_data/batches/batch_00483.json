And we could even consider adding a village cook.\n\nI don't know what you think.</span></pre>\n</div>\n<div id=\"tw-target-rmn-container\" class=\"tw-target-rmn tw-ta-container tw-nfl\" tabindex=\"0\" role=\"text\">\n<pre id=\"tw-target-rmn\" class=\"tw-data-placeholder tw-text-small tw-ta\" dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\" data-placeholder=\"\"></pre>\n</div>",

Once you have enough pigs or cows, there’s no real reason to farm or cook different meals. My idea is to make existing foods more useful and add variety for both early and late game.</p>\n<p data-start=\"500\" data-end=\"715\">First, veggies need parity — if we can bake potatoes, why not carrots or beetroots? Each cooked version could offer slightly better saturation. Also, we have poisonous potatoes, but not poisonous carrots or beets!</p>\n<p data-start=\"717\" data-end=\"988\">Stews are another missed opportunity. They should <strong data-start=\"767\" data-end=\"776\">stack</strong> (maybe up to 16), be <strong data-start=\"798\" data-end=\"823\">cookable in cauldrons</strong>, and have <strong data-start=\"834\" data-end=\"850\">more recipes</strong> — like pork, fish, or mutton stew. Adding small unique effects (speed, healing, or faster mining) would make them way more interesting.</p>\n<p data-start=\"990\" data-end=\"1158\">New crops like <strong data-start=\"1005\" data-end=\"1017\">tomatoes</strong> would refresh farming and unlock new dishes. Eggs could finally make <strong data-start=\"1087\" data-end=\"1098\">omelets</strong>, and <strong data-start=\"1104\" data-end=\"1113\">sugar</strong> could be cooked into caramel for desserts.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1160\" data-end=\"1362\"><strong data-start=\"1160\" data-end=\"1176\">Milk bottles</strong> (stackable up to 16) would make milk practical again. <strong data-start=\"1231\" data-end=\"1247\">Rotten flesh</strong> should be compostable — a realistic, useful change. And maybe <strong data-start=\"1310\" data-end=\"1321\">cookies</strong> could help baby villagers grow faster?</p>\n<p data-start=\"1364\" data-end=\"1557\">Small tweaks like these could make Minecraft’s food system more dynamic, rewarding, and fun — encouraging players to actually explore different diets instead of just living off steak forever!</p>\n<div id=\"gtx-trans\">\n<div class=\"gtx-trans-icon\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

The player can also place multiple wire on the same surface of a block like candles or sea pickles. add a redstone to wire block to convert the signal. finally insulated wire does not interact with other wire adjacent to it. This is mainly to compact redstone builds and make vertical builds less resource intensive.</p>",

It would be interesting to see what people would build. I thought It would be cool to build ships and pirate each other. Build cannons to attack other boats. That fishing Idea was another cool idea I never thought of. But there Is a lot Mojang could do with this. Add treasure maps and other loot, cannons and cannon ball blocks. I got the Greek mythology map pack in that, the creator had built a large boat, but was not movable :(&nbsp; &nbsp;The map pack was worth it though. I hope Mojang makes this Idea a reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

On paper it has a good purpose, preventing minecarts from launching in different directions when traveling, but many players enjoy using that property as I'm sure you'll see. I think a good workaround to appease the people who like, and don't like the change would be to have a way where you can crouch and place them to prevent them moving (if reasonably possible to implement)<br><br>The ability to turn off derailing is MASSIVE for rail networks, and will make it much less of a headache in the future (as there was no reliable way to slow down to avoid it before).<br><br>The main addition I would like to see is a way to toggle the powered and unpowered states of rail turns. The directional nature of rails makes it very tedious, and sometimes impossible, to construct very specific builds and turns that are perfectly possible in other orientations.<br><br>Perhaps turns could be right clicked with a pickaxe to be able to set the \"Powered\" and \"Unpowered\" turns, to give players more freedom in how they build railways.<br><br>Thanks for giving minecarts and rails some love! They are one of my favorite parts of the entire game</p>",

Second, minecart chaining should be much more consistent to allow creating trains. I am sure many other improvements could be introduced. Maybe some new kind of rails would be fitting (without making the present ones useless)? Or perhaps the furnace minecart should be replaced with something similar but better at its task?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In my opinion, improving old parts of the game is the way to go.

Reconsider that part.</p>\n<p>I also want to suggest making the powered rail recipe cheaper (for example make it use copper instead of gold?) or at least make the rail recipes craft more rail (32 instead of 16?). Minecarts are a mid-game travel method however they're way too expensive for that, you need 375 gold ingots to build a 1000 block track, which is a LOT of gold because it's quite rare, but that amount does seem fair for copper!</p>\n<p>My last suggestion is making the default max speed higher, like 12 or 16, but at the same time make minecarts slow down on turns. Speed of 16 would be great for transportation i think but at the same time it looks weird on turns.</p>\n<p>Mojang please read my comment thank you i love you also add data driven blocks than kyou gododbye</p>",

A solution to this is to introduce two new types of rail: One to increase the maximum speed of the minecarts, and one to decrease it. You would use the boosting rail to increase the max speed and then use power rails to make the minecart advance automaticly and gain up speed. A rail to decrease the speed (even below the standard maximum) could be used for technical purposes and for letting the player see for longer the surroundings of the rail for roller coster and such. Of course, these two do not have to be rails, they could be something that you woud add to a rail, such as a signal sign. With this modification, the max speed of minecrafts should stay at 8 without any boost.</li>\n<li>The ability to link minecarts is in order to make a sort of train is still much needed.

I had two things to note:<br><br><strong>#1: Creating these slopes</strong><br>To make actual slopes the end of a stair needs a slope too(understandable). To create the final slope at the moment you need to place a rail on the top platform(to make the rail one lower slope up), to remove it after. This feels like too many steps / janky / not smoothly I guess? I also saw multiple people's first instincts go to keeping the last rail and keeping it flat. A way to improve this (but you guys are the game designers, I am not one, this is purely an example) I had in mind is to make rails be able to slope when placing a new rail on the side of another block. So that when you place a rail on floor(or the one to final stair block) while clicking on the side of a block higher(when this is possble, aka when non curved rails), the rail automatically becomes a slope instead of staying flat running into the wall.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>#2: Vertical momentum &amp; end of momentum.</strong><br>The new jumps are fun! Fun is all what minecraft is about. Right now the vertical momentum feels limited. I don't know if this is either to make it feel more natural or to limit jankyness/OPness(understandable), but in my opinion this could use some finetuning(higher?/longer?/less resistance?). Also: The jumps(at high gamerule speed) randomly stop, instead of completing the whole curve, is this explicitly designed / tuned this way? It feels weird and at times kind of anticlimaxtic, in real life(as you know) things thrown complete their whole curve.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Review of changes: I love them, 9/10, very well the right direction.<br><br>(also the feedback site is broken, cannot leave comments without htmlediting the submit button to be not disabled)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>While all these changes are fun, the primary reason people don't use minecarts as a means of transport is because they're too slow. This can be solved by just increasing the speed but that's potentially too shallow, instead, there should be different types of rails.</p>\n<p>Copper powered rails can be the first tier. Copper is a common resource, which makes it easy for players in the early game to use minecarts. The speed of copper rails can be 16/12/8/4 blocks per second. I chose 16 because this would make minecarts faster than another early game mode of transport - horses. Horses have the advantage of being able to go anywhere, while minecarts can only go from point A to B. Horses work better for adventures, while minecarts should work better for going back and forth to existing locations. also, weathered copper rails having the speed of 8 means that existing redstone contraptions that rely on minecarts can still work. Gold powered rails are more expensive and logically should be much faster that copper ones. Ideally, the late game option of rails should be faster than the elytra, because once again, elytra has the advantage of being able to use it anywhere.</p>\n<p>another fun and good way to make minecarts better would be to give them an even higher speed than when used with powered rails. investing in making a really long slope for a minecart track should be rewarding, instead of giving you the same amount of speed that a powered rail can give. currently, minecart speed gained from slopes is highly limited, even with the gamerule minecartmaxspeed changed. slopes should accelerate the minecart much faster and to a further extent to make using them more exciting.</p>\n<p>i hope the minecart experiments come into the game sooner than later and won't be on hold for long periods due to new features. improving outdated existing features is much better than prioritizing adding new features.</p>",

That being said, there are some things that I would like to see improved.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As someone who uses minecarts for passenger transport, I would like to see better control of the speed. The Gamerule is practically perfect, since it's adjustable for those with potato devices. That being said, I think the default speed provided by the gamerule should be somewhere within 24-48 m/s to make a rail system worth it. I also think that a way to cap the speed at 8 m/s for contraptions such as hopper minecart&nbsp; farms and train stations is useful; perhaps a new rail type made with copper.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Cart stacking is also an issue that seems to be an issue for many, especially for the technical community that see their storage systems that use hopper and chest minecarts at risk of the new features. Added to that is the piston bolt, which is also at risk due to the inherent nature for minecarts to snap in the middle of the block, which the technical community is also raising alarm bells about. I am personally indifferent on keeping the piston bolts in my world, but I think finding ways to preserve them should be considered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The last thing I request is that furnace minecarts are given purpose to function as actual train locomotives.

Or gold powered rails could have a max speed of 24, the trade-off for the higher speed being that they're more expensive to craft.

I had two things to note:</p>\n<p>#1: Creating these slopes<br>To make actual slopes the end of a stair needs a slope too(understandable). To create the final slope at the moment you need to place a rail on the top platform(to make the rail one lower slope up), to remove it after. This feels like too many steps / janky / not smoothly I guess? I also saw multiple people's first instincts go to keeping the last rail and keeping it flat. A way to improve this (but you guys are the game designers, I am not one, this is purely an example) I had in mind is to make rails be able to slope when placing a new rail on the side of another block. So that when you place a rail on floor(or the one to final stair block) while clicking on the side of a block higher(when this is possble, aka when non curved rails), the rail automatically becomes a slope instead of staying flat running into the wall.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>#2: Vertical momentum &amp; end of momentum.<br>The new jumps are fun! Fun is all what minecraft is about. Right now the vertical momentum feels limited. I don't know if this is either to make it feel more natural or to limit jankyness/OPness(understandable), but in my opinion this could use some finetuning(higher?/longer?/less resistance?). Also: The jumps randomly stop, instead of completing the whole curve, is this explicitly designed / tuned this way? It feels weird and at times kind of anticlimaxtic, in real life(as you know) things thrown complete their whole curve. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Review of changes: I love them, 9/10, very well the right direction.</p>",

        "body": "<p>After some testing of the experimental features, I have a few suggestions.</p>\n<p><strong>Conserve Downward Momentum:</strong> As it stands, powered rails on an upward slope will cause the minecart to gain momentum and jump. However, no matter the height of a downward slope, transitioning to an upward slope gives the same height and distance as if no acceleration had occurred previously. This is primarily an issue when making roller coasters, but also limits the scope of this potentially game changing update. Especially if minecarts are to compete with elytra for end game travel.</p>\n<p><strong>Stacking Minecart Compromise</strong>: I personally feel the compromise you have put forth of using a dispenser for minecarts and minecart hoppers is a good one. A compromise for the TNT minecarts can be fixed fairly easily as well. An alternative to reverting the changes would be to allow explosive levels to a TNT minecart much like already exists for fireworks. You want a bigger boom? Add more TNT when crafting. Perhaps let the cap be 16, to limit overuse.</p>\n<p>Ideas others have shared that I agree with:</p>\n<p>-&nbsp;<em>Rail types to control speed</em></p>\n<p><em>- Chains to connect carts together&nbsp;</em></p>\n<p><em>- Improving the furnace variant</em></p>\n<p>I appreciate all the work you and the team are putting into this change and wish you all the best of luck in balancing the desires of the community with the impact of the update.</p>",

The elytra (and horse) desperately needs some competition and it's kind of boring never having a reason to build a proper tunnel-network since it wouldn't have been used anyway. And if one does decide to make such a tunnel, it has to be lined with either ice and a boat or soul sand etc - not the most inspiring solution (and it can't go up hill). So yes, for ease of travel and for a new reason to do some tunnel mining - I welcome these changes.</p>\n<p>However, having the changes break so many contraptions is a problem. As many others have suggested, is it possible to add a new, maybe copper based, track? And would it be possible to incorporate some kind of speed control into the track? (it would make the minecart to advanced/futuristic if it were added to the minecart itself unless it is a big break-leaver). Or make the powered one upgradeable to a smooth and quick ride? This as to leave much of the current behavior untouched, yet make the minecart interesting to work with even for those who isn't super into redstone contraptions?</p>",

That way, legacy minecarts would retain all the old properties for machines while new/upgraded minecart(s) could have varying amounts of max speeds, which could easily beat the elytra's max speed and making it very useful for traveling really long distances. The legacy minecarts could be the same 5 iron recipe, a simple upgrade would then imbue all the new minecart properties, further upgrades would increase the max speed, etc. 10's of thousands of blocks would be made insanely quick to travel at 1000m/s max speed as a very nice reward for a very tedious setup of rails and digging out tunnels. In addition, featuring both legacy minecarts and upgradable minecarts would guarantee that old rail systems and roller coasters will continue working because they'll retain old minecart mechanics.</p>",

The changes remove the possibility of such entity-based data storage without an alternative. Other people use this or similar setups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What I think can alleviate the issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the behavior of current carts and rails should be unchanged, even when the carts have left the rail. ANY changes will break things.</li>\n<li>new behaviors should be added to new carts, new rails, or new contraptions. I'm in favor of a new cart. There could be a ridable cart powered by wind charges (insertable manually or from hoppers), or one that simply goes faster and flies better through the air. I'll leave the creative details to Mojang. New rails could also work, such as special jump rails or other faster rails. Alternatively, something that allows railside contraptions to speed up the carts would also be welcome. Maybe a dispenser could put a rocket on a cart, temporarily granting a significant speed boost and the ability to fly through the air. A rail line with regularly spaced booster stations would thus enable faster speeds.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think there are a lot of ways to do this without breaking things.</p>",

This system has some advantage. By apply changes to minecarts, we can use already constructed railways with increased speed. And by using enchanting system, we don't have to make another different system. In addition, users will consume lapis lazuli which is rarely used in latter part of game.</p>",

The elytra are fast and fun to play on different routes or games, and they have freedom and minecart and are very fast but only on set routes. Then the boats and other options for other use cases.

Just make the anvil 1 netherite ingot plus an anvil -- it'll still be expensive, but not so expensive as to be useless.</li>\n<li>Give it some kind of extra power that normal anvils/other blocks don't have.

It would be stronger than netherite blocks just like anvils are stronger than normal iron blocks.</p>",

This wouldn't break enchanting, though 124 ancient debris is absurdly expensive, so perhaps it should instead be in the upper hundreds. Now, because of how level advancement works, some would probably think you might as well remove the cap entirely, as it's nearly impossible to level up that high anyway. And you know what? I'm not the best judge of that, but I think this is a much better way of making the netherite anvil than simply making it unbreakable.</p>\n<p>Revision suggestions aside, I do really love the idea, and am pleasantly surprised that others had this idea as well!</p>",

In Indonesia there's a volcano where the lava burns a bright blue due to the high number of sulfur deposits in the volcano. The block can be mined, and put in a crafting table to make 9 sulfur, and visa-versa, like coal, wheat, gold, etc.. I could generate In small pools or in columns in the Soul sand vallies. If used as fuel for a furnace it will burn for 1.5 as long as normal lava would. It would deal double damage like regular lava, and Netherite would be immune to it as well.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I was just going to suggest that husks should be a source of sand when I saw this thread. I also like your idea about the cobble and TNT as well. Honestly how it is done is less important to me.</p>\n<p>The bottom line is I think that sand really should be a renewable resource. Like you mentioned, there is glass, sandstone, and concrete that it is required for, but my biggest issue is TNT. Currently TNT is the only method of automatically breaking blocks (unless someone has figured out how to harness endermen, lol). This makes it essential for many truly automatic farms. I often avoid making TNT entirely, not only because it is resource intensive, but the resources are also lost permanently. And I really don't like destroying my deserts.</p>\n<p>I think there are many methods to make it renewable without making it broken and still keeping with the current feel of Minecraft. The husk idea is a really good way to start because it would make sand production very slow while still making it theoretically infinite. A crafting method would be much more productive, while not allowing the process to be automated.</p>\n<p>I think another method, and my favorite, might involve the new grindstone. Possibly a cobble in each slot could make a sand. (Or if you wanted to include gravel, 2 cobbles into 1 gravel and 2 gravel into 1 sand). This method could also potentially be automated in the future if hoppers could interact with the grindstone (maybe similar to the mechanics of a furnace). A timer would also probably need be added to the grindstone in this case (also like a furnace).</p>\n<p>Anyway, maybe the grindstone idea would be too big of a change, but I think one of the other methods at least would be a great addition. Please make sand renewable :)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EDIT: I realized that I totally over looked creepers and withers as a means of breaking blocks (oops, face-palm). But this still doesn't change my overall opinion as I find these a little unreliable (even though these are probably decent methods).</p>",

It wouldn't be op, because it needs to be more accessible. It's likely to become even more useful in the future too. Maybe 50-75% of a husk dropping it. Also, maybe you could find specifically husk spawners in deserts &amp; Mesas, so you can easily farm them, and maybe red sand when they spawn in Mesas. Sand is a resource you just constantly need, and for getting <strong>just a little</strong> bit from husks wouldn't make a difference in my opinion.</p>",

If this \"filter/comparing hopper\" finds an item identical to the one in the slot, it pushes it to a container downwards of the hopper. Otherwise, it behaves like a normal SIDEWARDS hopper and pushes it sidewards. There would be 3 inventories instead of one: The first inventory with 5 slots would contain items that were put into this hopper, but were not compared to the comparison slot, yet. Items identified as a positive match with the comparison item, are put into the second (bottom) inventory row of 1 slot, from where they are treated as follows: Only items in here can be absorbed by hoppers below, and they will be push into containers/hoppers below. All other items go into the 3rd inventory of 5 slots, which will be pushed into the next sidewards hopper.</p>\n<p>I recommend this \"sidewards\" system instead of a \"downwards\" system to reduce sorting space/materials required. I usually tend to put many different items into the same box in the end, for example I have a \"redstone double chest\", where I put in all of my redstone stuff: Redstone, Redstone blocks, redstone torches, comparators etc. If the stuff I sort would always go downwards 1 block with each comparison, it would be very difficult to set up.</p>\n<p>Why is this needed?</p>\n<p>Current \"automated storage systems\" are very large and consume high amounts of RAM. With such a block, it would be much easier to have an automated storage, and it would be faster, too.</p>",
