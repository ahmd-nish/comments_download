Dens would be bigger (varying in size vertically/horizontally) and could have more rooms (but one main room). They would also vary in appearance depending on which mob's den it is.</p>\n<p>I guess the nest does sound like a spawner though, however I meant more like only a specific mob could spawn in the den until you break the nest, then any mob could spawn. Of course there could just be no nest and they could stay mob-specific areas where the mobs can keep spawning; I was trying to think of a way to balance it, but I'm not sure how to do it or if it needs that kind of balance tbh.</p>",
