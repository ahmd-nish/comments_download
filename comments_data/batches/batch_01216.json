There is no excuse and absolutely no reason that these skins haven't been added so please if there are developer reading this just add the athletic Steve and Alex skins. It would solve this small problem and it wouldn't take long. I don't believe that you wouldn't add a black skin because somebody made a racist comment so please prove it.

When he couldn't figure out where his Minecoins went, I discovered there's absolutely no way to track purchase history on the Nintendo Marketplace. The current system has two major flaws:</p>\n<ol class=\"[&amp;:not(:last-child)_ul]:pb-1 [&amp;:not(:last-child)_ol]:pb-1 list-decimal space-y-1.5 pl-7\">\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The \"sort by newest\" feature doesn't even work properly (often showing older items before newer ones)</li>\n<li class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">There's no price information for past purchases, making it impossible to track Minecoin spending</li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\">A simple transaction log showing the item name, purchase date, and Minecoin cost would solve this completely. This seems like such a basic feature for any digital marketplace. Hope the team can implement this soon!</p>",

I submitted a support ticket for missing Minecoins at <a href=\"https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/request/new\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://help.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/request/new</a>. For \"What is the Category of Your Questions?\" I selected \"Marketplace Support\" and for \"What is the Subject for Your Question?\" I selected \"Cannot Find Purchase\". After a few emails, I thought to ask for a transaction history. The helpful people in support were able to provide it. I would recommend others who are in the same situation to request this information from support as well until this feature is implemented. It is a pretty standard feature, so I don't think this is a crazy request.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If this is for your children, the support ticket must be created with a parent's account. I would recommend noting the child's account information in the \"What can we help with?\" section so support can actually look into it. A support ticket created with a child's account under 12 years will apparently be closed immediately with a friendly note to have a parent resubmit the ticket.&nbsp;</p>",

(It is called \"City Life\") And in Legacy Console, There were MashUp packs for $3, containing skins, a world, and a texture pack. they were pretty fun, not going to lie. but now we have overpriced microtransactions, with awful maps for $10. The map I'm Working on is so much better and it will be downloadable for free, so we don\"t need the store. Microtransactions are really for a free mobile game, and although Minecraft Bedrock is supposed to be a mobile game, Its sad that the most powerful console in the world, the Xbox One X, is running a buggy game made for phones and tablets.</p>",

I wasn't thinking that Mojang should host it themselves and make people pay for everything like in Bedrock, but just one place to find everything easily by searching and one place for all Minecraft creators (including 3rd party and ones made by Minecraft themselves possibly) to put their mods safely. I imagine it being a piece of mind thing for all players more than a thing you have to pay for. If Mojang or someone from the Minecraft community can make a Marketplace for Java, I really hope they make it all free like Java has always been 🙂</p>",

Mojang would never make our existing resources paid, as removing resourcepack, datapack, or map making support for free would also remove the people that would be making things for this new marketplace. What people tend to forget is that Microsoft has spent over 2.5 billion dollars on this game. They obviously need some way to make their money back. If they don’t this game is not making them profit and they’d have to stop development. Currently, java is a prime example of this. Our current options are that Java either gets a marketplace or development on it stops all together, and we all get to play the glitch fest that is bedrock edition. Those are just my first points, this is also an amazing idea because it allows datapack, resourcepack, and map development to actually be profitable for creators on java. For anyone wondering why I didn’t mention mods. Mods are a third party entity to Minecraft that run off things like forge or fabric. This would mean they wouldn’t be in this marketplace. I also highly doubt any skins would be either. In conclusion, Microsoft would be completely brain dead to not take advantage of this completely open opportunity to make not only more jobs for Minecraft content creators, but also some extra money. </p>",

HEre's some things to address:<br><br>1) Some of them have a cost... 100% fair, I want to pay for the time and work the developer of the add-on put into it but I do agree that cost may keep many buyers off the table. Mostly if they are underage</p>\n<p>2)More than 1 add-on or add to Realms? ... YES you can add more than 1 to any existing or new world and even add them to Realms. Check the \"Behavior packs\" setting in the world config to add multiple or to Realms)</p>\n<p>3)Simulation distance in Realms (capped at 4) can introduce a problem with spawning add-on mobs. For example, I always have 3-6 dragons around me at all times when playing on my Realm. They ar emor elike cockroaches than dragons since they are so common due to SIm distance and maybe the spawn table is also too common on top of that</p>\n<p>4) A problem with these add-ons is that the recipe book doesn't seem to include them in. Thus, you must memorize recipes or use the add-on books to craft items. Would be nice to have these integrated into te recipe book at the crafting menu.</p>\n<p>5) What would I like to see in the future?... Backpacks, more furniture, more creatures, more enemies, more weapons and tools, maybe the integration of some of the biggest mods (create, botania, mekanism) into Bedrock...</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Really excited to finally see this being added.

        "body": "<p>Pros: Gives every console with access to minecraft the ability to download and install addons onto any world. Allows more creators to individually create content without the need of a team behind the map creation.</p>\n\n<p>Cons: There is a limit to the free posts a marketplace creator can make. (To my knowledge it is 2 or 3 per account could have been changed though). Not every user has access to a source of income to purchase addons as well as creators don't always want to force a payment wall behind their work.</p>\n\n<p>How to fix: I understand that it costs mojang money to review addons and getting too many free addons would just cost them more money than they would be making. So an easy solution is to charge a standard fee of let's say $10-$40 to make a free post that exceeds the standard free post limit. For anyone saying paying a $40 fee just to post a free addon is ridiculous well to an extent your correct but keep in mind that this is the only place that every single console can access these addons and mojang needs to be paid for the review time. When posting a game onto steam it costs $100 per game whether it's free or not and people don't complain about that. It would also prevent people from spamming less quality filled addons since each one would cost them to post. As for the review time on updating a free post, you could require the user to list a github repo or something equivalent to check all changed files and only review the changed files instead of reviewing everything.</p>",

It gives players way  more to explore and can even come with new bosses and valuable gear. Just let the creative energy flow.

My favorite ones so far have been dragon fire and decocraft. My one problem that I have with a lot of these addons(as well as a lot of other addons attached to worlds) is that a lot of the new “blocks” are coded as entities, I understand this is easier for coding and programming interactions but it’s really annoying having a chair with health points or looking for furniture in creative mode and having to scroll through spawn eggs. I have two major requests, my first request is that there should be additional tabs in creative mode added for each add on to separate the items from the vanilla stuff(similar to Java) because right now it gets really messy and disorganized and hard to find stuff. My second request is for you guys to Please add chisel and bits, minecraft comes alive, doggy talents, a magic mod, the wings mod, bibliocraft, and custom npcs, as the next addons. it would be amazing. thanks.</p>",

It is well known that due to Mojang's own laziness and stinginess, the Bedrock Edition community has long been far less vibrant than the Java Edition. With players already able to see many high-quality mods available for the Java Edition, I doubt there will be much motivation left for them to pay. For Bedrock Edition to take money from players, it needs to offer add-ons of extremely high quality... But guess what? The interfaces Mojang has opened up are not even as good as those in MC China Edition. Add-ons there mostly consist of entities.</p>\n<p>Bedrock Edition, as a stable version that can be played across multiple platforms, with Microsoft stepping in almost from scratch, should have been able to fix most of Java Edition's downsides and have a brilliant future. But now it's like a zombie, already dead but still moving.</p>\n<p>Please open up more interfaces and encourage the community to create high-quality add-ons. The Bedrock Edition market could become a very promising money tree.</p>\n<p>Also, get rid of that xxxx render dragon so players can create their own shader packs, or do it yourselves and release an official shader pack. Or buy each player an RTX 4090.</p>\n<p>Even though we've said so much, will Mojang do it? Looking back over the past decade, I can pessimistically sentence all of this to death.</p>\n<p>I sincerely hope I'm wrong.</p>",

The naturalist add on is easily the best one that I have no doubt is the leading non-free add on y’all have released. Please add more like that one. I know yall have to cater to the entire community which has younger ones that like that more silly stuff but you also still have a massive player base of mature gamers that love the survival aspect of the game. Thank you for hearing me out. Love the 1.21 update coming out by the way.</p>",

I've found a couple of very interesting ones that I enjoyed playing on and some that weren't what I expected it them to be. For me that's a serious issue. Currently there is no way to test any marketplace content before you buy it. So, sometimes you end up with something that wasn't what you were looking for.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>My solution for this issue is that you should have free demo versions available in the marketplace. They can be limited versions of the full add-on without all the features unlocked or ever available to use for a limited time only after its activation. This way a player can download the free and limited version, test it for some time and then proceed to buy the complete version with all features.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I believe this is going to improve greatly the experience of all minecraft players that use the marketplace. It'll also enhance the discoverability of quality content.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

This system would serve as a central hub for all add-on information, offering:\n<br />A Centralized Library: A digital \"quest book\" or \"manual\" that automatically populates with guides for all installed add-ons.\n<br />Interactive Features: Each entry could contain sections, searchable keywords, and potentially even track quests or progress related to the add-on's features.\n<br />Enhanced Player Experience: This would provide a cleaner, more intuitive way for players to learn about new content, reducing frustration and improving the overall quality of Addons </p>",

        "body": "<p>I think this is a great idea. Currently people that use custom skins do not get to enjoy the rewards for achievements without having to stop using their own custom skin, and for some players, this means to stop being themselves. The Character Creator should be a way for players to get to express themselves and put themselves in the game, but without custom skins, a lot of us do not get to truly put ourselves in the game. Sales should not be a problem with this feature being added, as I think it will actually increase them. There are many nice items like the Santa Hat or Top Hat that I would buy if I could put them on my custom skin, and many others probably would too. A way to implement this could be to add a custom skin button to the character creator or add it in the \"base\" section. When selected, all things (like mouth and top, all the stuff that would normally be selected to show some kind of skin) should be set to none. Players can then add things by selecting the parts they want to have on their skin and ignoring ones that would mess it up. The things they choose should overwrite any previous stuff in the position, such as adding eyes would change a specific part of the skin, even if it is not where the actual eyes are on the skin. There could be a button added to move parts like facial hair or eyes on the skin (within limits) to fix this. A hat should overwrite floating hair pixels to prevent errors happening with 3D parts. Please give us the ability to be ourselves!</p>",

And some minor Monsters, like Froggits, Looxes, Vulcans, and Snowdrakes. The texture pack could make Slimes look like Moldsmals, Witches and the magician Pillagers (forgot what they're called, whoops) look like Madjicks, Horses could look like Gyftrots, Villagers could look like some of the townsfolk in Snowdin; Rabbits, A Wolf (could be a leather worker or blacksmith), the Librarian could be a green Lizard monster like in the Librarby, Endermen could be the tall Amalgamates, Vexes could be like- Tsunderplane or something. For Waterfall, there could be the use of Skulk sensors in the maze rooms, and a blue flower could be retextured to look like an Echo flower, and not be affected by light values. The Spore blossoms can be used too, since there are these little firefly looking things in Waterfall, which could be retextured spores. I'm starting to run out of ideas, but if anyone from Mojang or anything reads this, thank you-</p>",
