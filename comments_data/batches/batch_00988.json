There would be Taverns in the wilderness, with rooms upstairs and what not. and if you were so inclined you could buy yourself a room (a change that would be added to make this a bit more possible would be locked doors with keys, and maybe some locked chests aswell).</p>\n<p>I believe that there would be a stable outside, with a horse or two, and a stable left for some wandering trader llamas. You see the main reason I was thinking about the tavern is a way that the wondering trader would visit your house left, and would go to the inn on his journey through the over world.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additional idea would be a taskmaster, who would sort of appear like a regular in the tavern. He might trade dungeon only finds for lots of emeralds, and would sell treasure maps/mansion and temple maps.</p>",

I would extend it to all pants, because it adds a unique enchantment to this piece of armor, being that the helmet and boots already have many unique enchantments. Maybe it could be added that depending on what kind of material the pants are, it gives more or less space places. For example: leather pants with Pocket III enchantment would give 6 spaces, and a Netherite pants with Pocket III would only give 4.</p>",
