Farming is really easy right now and it needs some challenge. For example, the growth of each plant could be influenced by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The biome/dimension</li>\n<li>The altitude</li>\n<li>Sky access and/or type of lighting</li>\n<li>The season (if added)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some plants would be affected more by certain factors than others. Under very good conditions, crops would be slightly more efficeint than they are now. Under poor conditions, crops would grow slower and give poorer yields. Under bad conditions, crops might even die. For example, some crops might grow more efficiently if given sky access, but also be more succeptible to freezing in a taiga biome or during winter when exposed to the sky.</p>",
