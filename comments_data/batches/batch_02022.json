There should be an OPTION to add 1-5 more players and to make them fight you (evil) or follow you(good).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you&nbsp;want them to fight you, you can set a difficulty, they search for you to kill you, the higher the difficulty the better loot you can get they should also respawn in the overworld within 4,000 blocks from you or the portal that you entered, they should reswawn in 30 min. They can also flatten out a small area and build a small house.</span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\">If you chose them to follow you, then you can give them commands like to help mine, draw a map, follow to help fight with you, you can also control their inventory, make them go fishing, trade with you, cut down a certain amount of trees, or just tell them to wander off. You have to give them the tools to access certain options, when the tool breaks then they stop what they were doing and come back to the actual player for the next command. They are very bad at doing things when you start off, as time goes on, they gather exp, Their exp+half of the actual players exp= skill level, the higher the skill level the better they are at doing things, at first they mine slowly and attack with barely any damage and take a long time to start a swing or charge a bow, when their skill level is higher they become quicker and better at doing certain tasks, they might also get more command options. If they die it takes 30 minutes to respawn, they drop only their exp and inventory.&nbsp;</span></p>",

It ought to be something that inducts the player into the pillaging lifestyle, rewarding them for the emeralds &amp; loot they bring home. Also up the iron golem spawn rate (I've never actually seen it myself in my villages) and give the villagers ways to actually defend themselves. That way pillaging villages becomes a challenge to consider.</p>",

I feel this would be a better replacement for the \"trade\" as that doesnt feel like an illager thing to do.</p>\n<p>-You should also have ways to lose rep, such as by killing villagers, golems, illagers, ravagers, winning/losing raids etc. The climb upwards should be exponential and exponentially easier to fall down.</p>\n<p>-Let us ride Ravagers!!!!!</p>\n<p>-Illagers should protect you if you get hurt, similar to how they protect their own.</p>\n<p>-There should also be some unique bonuses you get the more you help illagers, like a slight crossbow buff that helps make up for the differences between the two.</p>",

Following which Illagers become peaceful, and Villagers (as well as Golems) hostile mobs.\n<br />I think that the first trade level must be like with Piglins. The player must hold a Ruby in his arm (because of what Illagers won't attack the player) and then trow it. Maybe next steps can have similar system with Villagers.\n<br />Also after selecting a side a Ravager can be tamed and ridden by the player. However it will be much more difficult to tame a Ravager than a Horse. It requires a different type of saddle. Feeding two tamed Ravagers (Enchanted?) Golden Apple activates love mode, causing them to mate and produce a foal. \n<br />The player can learn from Evokers how to summon Vexes as well. It could be a new line of development - Magic (do not confuse with Brewing).</p>",

If the devs want to make it so that someone is enticed to get the highest level of enchantments, then why arbitrarily limit it? If I want to go around the world for books, I'll do that, and I've done that in the past. I always knew trading with villagers was an option, but most times I preferred exploring anyways and seeing the books as an extra bonus.</p>\n<p>TO THE DEVS: Please don't do this to the player base. Please don't turn into other studios that pigeonhole the players into one pathway for progression! Minecraft is supposed to have multiple ways to play and complete the game (if they even choose to complete it). Why get rid of the player's ability to play in their SINGLEPLAYER game the way they want? Leave the multiple paths open to the player's interest. If you feel that some biomes you have spent a lot of time updating aren't getting enough attention, then make them more enticing to visit and live in using a unique way. Do not punish those who have found playstyles they have grown accustomed to (unless it's truly game-breaking and ruins the fun for other people in multiplayer).</p>",
