It can also do this to other blocks other than stone to sand just like other stones and pulverize it into something else, or something like that, it can be whatever that fits scientifically. Wood will still drop wood, and concrete will still drop concrete though. If they add a new block maybe it would make this even more beneficial. I want a renewable way to get calcite though.

        "body": "<p>RENEWAL OF DESIGN!!!</p>\n<p>Sculk Gloom is a block that hovers in the air just like a conduit but is bigger, it pulses and has a slight sound of beating. If activated by sensors, it will break blocks from 4 blocks away from the Gloom. It will have an animation of turning them into sculk blocks then pop out the former blocks, like stone or wood. It works per 1 tick every block within its radius. It works like explosions but won't make explosion noise. The sensor won't detect its vibration, so it won't activate if it pulses or gloom a block. The blocks won't be flying away it will appear on top of sculk veins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The scenario is like a decay where if it gets closer to the source it will turn sculk then disappears. and then rise up from the sculk. You can get the item entities by placing sculk veins on a hopper. The range of which they rise out of is 8 blocks away from the Gloom and should not be near 6 blocks from the Gloom.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The second toggle function is activated by placing crying obsidian near it for 2 blocks away maximum. The normal stage breaks blocks that are the same as the blocks, except things that cant get without silk touch, it will drop what it should drop, if xp or items. The glowing purple toggle, turns stones into sand and other blocks into other blocks, maybe terracotta to red sand? It won't turn diorite into calcite though,, but maybe if quartz blocks then it would break into 1-2 quartz, it's like recycling blocks.&nbsp;</p>",
