Both the copper and tuff were at best some random signal generators or quirky decor so it's not a surprise they lost the votes.</p>\n<p>Or tweak the idea from the Glare, and have a golem that wonders on the edge of the torch light (level 1 or nearest wall path) and will growl at nearby hostiles. Players can lead it with a leash, however, if in the dark without a light source it acts cowardly, aka doesn't growl at monsters. No attack feature nearly a guard dog.

It can be a larger phantom called the “queen phantom” that lays the eggs. Attacks include 1, lullaby, and it gives you 3 seconds of blindness and slowness. 2, wing blast, blasts you away from it. 3, swarm, summons 2 or 3 phantoms that are smaller and weaker, Mabel slower? They would be baby’s and they don’t do much.</p>",

While the flag is above the bell, every night the village will be attacked by phantoms. Their goal is to kill all available iron golems.
