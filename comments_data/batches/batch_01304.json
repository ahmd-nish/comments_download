EVERYONE wants a 1 tick delay. no body needs another 2 game tick delay we have plenty... when things fit to perfectly together and everything matches weres the creativity to get around problems? id rather build something from random stuff than have a cookie cutter list of what to use. builders love those weird blocks that dont match that have a differnt vibe to them... redstoners well dont worry you dont need creativity you can just use these limiting blocks and all the future limiting blocks..... whats the point of a 20 game ticks if we only get half to use. builders dont buld higher than 128... even though theres space we want to limit you because we know best.&nbsp;</p>",

Particularly, we would like to have a block that helps us to more conveniently introduce odd tick delays just like the copper bulb did. But this doesn't have to necessarily be the copper bulb. People tended to use it either for its 1 gt delay OR as a T flip-flop, not necessarily both at the same time. However, in T flip-flops and binary counters it can create synchronization issues esp. when the space is tight (such as tileable systems) and probably many other contraptions such as those typically built by computational redstoners. Maybe instead of cramming too much functionality into one block we could have our cake and eat it too by splitting up its original function into two separate blocks.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EDIT: Someone suggested 1/2/3/4 gt of delay depending on oxidation level. I think that's a good idea, but maybe have a delay of 0/1/2/3 gt instead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The derby factor needs to be addressed as well, with bats making the Warden chase them, the animations occurring in weird areas that feel unnatural like emerging small holes and on single block pillars. The Warden should also be given a rough direction of the sound the Sculk Senser picked up that lead to its spawning. Sneaking should also have an ineffective range of a block, maybe two. Sculk patches should also always, at least, have a Shrieker and two to three Sensors. But, overall, a really cool mob with loads of potential that I'm excited to see progress.</p>",

No notes. 10/10 would get absolutely suplexed by a Warden hell-in-a-cell style again.</p>\n<p>The Warden does seem to need a bit of polishing imo: it gets stuck in water rather easily. Most deep dark biomes are currently located alongside dripstone caves and wardens get trapped inside the tiny water pools very easily, unable to move. Also they get distracted by bats a lot. But maybe that's more of an accidental feature? (It saved my life down there more than once lmao.)</p>\n<p>As people have already noted, it's still pretty easy to cheese a Warden, but I know the team are working on solutions. Perhaps some sort of \"sculk tendrils\" equivalent to evoker fangs? So if a player pillars or digs out of a warden's reach, the sculk tendrils reach out and damage them (or maybe even pull them closer towards the warden?). Just a suggestion though.</p>\n<p>Chest loot is easy enough to find once you know the areas where they can spawn. Currently the actual treasure is a bit lacking (as it currently stands, enchanted books and some candles aren't worth the risk of clearing a city) but I suspect the loot tables will tweaked as time goes on. Humbly requesting a chance for god apples please and thank you.</p>\n<p>Keep up the great work!</p>",

Could even make for cool systems, as it'd allow for control of where and whether the warden spawns.</p>\n<p>About the ancient cities, I don't have much too add besides that I think carpets would look better than wool blocks (though carpets would have to be changed to also occlude vibrations). Also, this might count as a bug report moreso than feedback, but since this is an experimental snapshot, there's no bug tracker, so I'll report it here: below the structure made out of reinforced deepslate there is a cavity with a bunch of soul soil (which can sometimes be replaced by sculk which will have soul fire on top), sometimes a warden can spawn there and obviously get set on fire, sometimes getting trapped there until it dies, so maybe make it so wardens can't spawn on blocks that are on fire or have other non-solid blocks on top of them.</p>\n<p>This is a coherency suggestion that might also double as an Easter Egg: when spectating from Warden's POV in Spectator mode you can see as you normally would with any other mob, given that some mobs (creepers, endermen, spiders, etc.) have \"easter eggs\" when you spectate them, adding the Warden's POV as a blind mob guided not by sight but by vibrations would be awesome.</p>",

If so, what did you enjoy / not enjoy about your encounters with the Warden?<br>- The Warden is very difficult to kill, and I think this goes well with the fact it's not really meant to be an enemy you're supposed to fight, but rather escape from.<br>- I love that multiple Wardens can spawn at once, making the situation increasingly tense.<br>- Unfortunately, players can either nerd pole with wool (or really any other blocks), or jump onto a tall structure in the Deep Dark, and the Warden cannot pursue them.<br>- My suggestion to fix this issue of nerd poling and climbing to escape the Warden so easily is to make it so that the Warden has a climbing mechanic, where he can climb the sides of blocks with his arms, going upwards. This could be defeated with a lip over the edge of a tower or a wall, but at least that takes a few extra precious seconds.<br>- You guys did an amazing job with this creature and its design aside from that!<br><br>\n</li>\n<li>Describe any encounters you had with the Warden - did they feel enjoyable?<br>- I don't think \"enjoyable\" is the word I'd use, but rather \"scary\", and yes.</li>\n<li>Were you able to figure out how to sneak around the Warden?<br>- Yep! Just bring wool blocks, keep your distance, and don't place them directly on sculk sensors like Captain Sparklez was doing XD<br><br>(Continuing in a 2nd reply because of the 1500 character limit)</li>\n</ul>",

With the big, open, areas, that was quite easy to do. I loved encounters with the Warden in tight corridors. Those were the tensest moments for me when my means of escape were restricted. In one of my encounters, the warden became very angry, and I ended up being cornered, leading to a very scary, but entertaining death. It didn't take me very long to grasp the warden's mechanics. Its animation and sounds clearly show how it works, and I am very impressed with the design in that department. I looted many chests. Those were never much of a challenge since I could quickly grab one and bolt. The darkness effect was cool, I don't have much of an opinion on it, but I am a little confused by when it activates. I've had the warden spawn without the effect, and I've had the effect hit me without the warden. I couldn't quite grasp what was causing darkness, but it was spooky. The encounters with the warden were surprisingly tense. The scariest moments were when I accidentally summoned the warden in a tight space, like at the bottom of a pit. Again, tighter corridors make the warden infinitely more terrifying to deal with. Though, now that I experienced the mob, I am not too scared, knowing that it's not too hard to deal with.</p>",

Also during the warden's spawning animation, it feels off being able to go right up to him and have no consequences, maybe have an area around his spawning location that if entered will deal a warden's hit worth of damage during the climbing animation.</p>\n<p>Suggestions: Give the warden some kind of pulling ability, so if you just pillar up and his AI cant get closer to you and you are within like 5 blocks, have him wind up a pull or something. In addition, make him immune to projectiles, although it takes quite a few arrows, pillaring up 10 blocks and bowing him to death seems a bit too cheesy. And make the loot inside the city better, like End City loot is probably the most comparable to what I feel it should be.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And the skulk shrieker effect needs to be added to subtitles</p>",

I think utilizing soul laterns and soul sand removes a lot of the uniqueness of the nether exploring those biomes in the dimension. One way to fix this is by giving sculk block a use if being like netherrack and soul sand/soil. Imagine if full blocks of sculk were ignitable and it emitted not a blue or orange flame but a green one that has a very dim light level to give the similar effect. Then that adds a use and lore to the structure and sculk blocks. This then can make sculk laterns and campfires and torches. These would give a lot more variance in decoration as well.</p>",

From the moment it spawns, the combinations of the Darkness effect, the excellent tracking capabilities of the warden, and the layout of the Ancient Cities come together wonderfully to create a sense of fear and panic, which is exactly what I was hoping to get from the experience. While escaping, the bouts of darkness made me slow down to make sure I was sticking to a safe pathway and avoiding any skulk sensors. As I went around corners, I would have to listen and look closely for where the Warden was. The snowball mechanic was pretty balanced, not distracting the Warden for long, and also requiring precision to aim the snowball to land near enough the warden to distract it, but far enough that you would get some leeway. My biggest gripe with the snapshot was with the loot from the city. Currently, I found the biggest rewards to be skeleton skulls on the walls and the Swift Sneak book. The enchantment, however, feels extremely overpowered. It makes evading the warden too easy, especially with level 3. After it was summoned, I simply crouchwalked away before it had even begun searching for me. Also, by running for a moment then crouching, it is possible to maintain sprint speed without making a sound.</p>",

I'm grateful for the new enchantment, don't get me wrong, but I feel like it just... isn't enough.

A new item exclusive to the Deep Dark that has uses outside of the biome would be good.<br><br>- Reinforced Deepslate definitely needs a use.

It wasn't too bad since I'm used to game mechanics similar to other games that involve sneaking around and disarming threats.</p>\n<p>I thought there was a balanced amount of shriekers, some close together which provided a good challenge to get rid of as alerting the warden is unavoidable.</p>\n<p>The warden is a huge threat. but after setting off a shrieker enough times and spawning a warden I found running away from the area quickly out of range of the warden stops both the darkness effect and his ability to sniff you out, making all my warden encounters easy to get out of. Perhaps you may be able to solve this by increasing the range of the effect as well as his sniffing range.</p>\n<p>The loot table was a bit unsatisfactory for the effort put into exploring and sneaking, although the books would make exploring the structure in the early game worth it and the bones are plentiful and creepy. Swift sneak is a great addition and a great unique item, although I do believe you should be able to put it with most enchants such as depth strider and frost walk. The loot table could be greater by adding certain items that are worth the potential risk like a diamond block or up to enchanted tools and weapons, possibly a loot value a little less of which you find in end cities.&nbsp;</p>",

With the warden in the vicinity, I was terrified when I didn't know where he was, it could be better if its effect on night vision was increased by a sliver.</p>\n<p>I do not feel I need to say anything about being able to cheese the warden at this time, as I know the anti-cheese methods are not in place as of now and would be better to critique them when they are released.</p>\n<p>The spawning of the warden at times was janky is the best way to describe it. In one instance I had the warden spawned in a two-block gap in the wall and started suffocating until he burrowed back into the ground and other times almost out of range of the player, although it would be too harsh to make the warden spawn underneath the player. Distance from the player if it's already a factor may need to be tweaked.</p>\n<p>That's my feedback, continue to keep making this game even greater 👍👍</p>",

I fought it with Protection IV Netherite Armor and it was dealing four and a half hearts per hit! I didn't want to cheese the fight, so I just fought the Warden in a open cave. I was eventually successful after three deaths (granted I not great at PVP by any means). Based off of this I would suggest that either the Warden's damage or health be decreased somewhat.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. As aforementioned, I thought the Ancient City's architecture and overall look was phenomenal and a wonderful addition to go along with the Warden. However, based off the power of the Warden and the other dangers of being so far underground, I was hoping for some better loot in the chests. I really enjoyed the addition of the bones, enchanted books, and candles, but I felt that they were lacking something a little more valuable. Based off of my gameplay experience, I would love to see some valuables included such as diamonds or copper, useful (but balanced) potions such as night vision or speed, or maybe even an ender pearl or two for a quick getaway.</p>",

I found two instances of a floating soul lantern in the corridors around the city. Aside from those two issues, the structure is awesome and I look forward to finding and exploring these when the full release comes out. However, the Warden has a problem. He can't fit under 2 blocks meaning you can easily cheese the fight. When I was messing around with him though, I saw an animation where he bends down and charges. Perhaps this could mean he could bend over to chase you through the 2 block tall area? He also is easily knocked back with a bow that just has punch II allowing you to just spam him. It may be a good idea to decrease the amount of knockback he can take. All around, an excellent start. I am impressed beyond belief. The Ancient City is astonishing and the Warden is a great mob even if it's a bit rough around the edges. I can't wait for this update to drop in full and the team is doing amazing work.</p>",

Another way is to just put water down, which pushes the warden away. Since the warden is so heavy it sinks, it shouldn't get pushed by the water. Currently the max swift sneak enchant that increases the speed of sneaking is 4, but it would be fun if higher numbers also worked with commands. I couldn't find a way to keep the warden from despawning, so it would be cool if putting it in a minecart or naming would stop the despawning.

They can hear when you are placing down wool on skulk blocks, which I'm not sure if this a bug or feature, but I feel like wool shouldn't make a sound when placed on skulk. It makes it too difficult to diffuse skulk sensors and shriekers.</p>\n<p>Are multiple Warden's at a time intentional or a bug? One thing I think would be cool if there could only be one Warden at a time, but he could warp to areas that a shrieker/sensor warns him about and rise out of the ground there.</p>\n<p>I think that the Deep Dark Biome shouldn't always have an Ancient City. I liked in the Warden introduction that there were caves with skulk by themselves, I think adding these types of caves could diversify the Deep Dark a little bit. Also I liked that cabin structure that was in the reveal. I think that would be a cool structure to find in the caves.</p>\n<p>Besides these gripes, I'm loving the snapshot. Great work so far!

It's even hard to tell where this biome starts unless you see some sculk (but biome is bigger than it's apperance). Instead of some blobs of this blocks this biome could look similar to lush caves - nearly an entire floor of sculk and more skulk on walls and ceiling, maybe adding something like sculk vines. With that we will clearly see where the edges of this biome are. Dripstone caves shouldn't blend with Deep Dark after all. Biome apperance should be way deeper, from around Y -16 to the bottom of the world (It's DEEP Dark after all). This would equalize amount of sculk that apeeared higher in the world (deeper but more instead of higher and less). Anicient Cities are epic and really fit in game (but sometimes air generation around this structure looks bad and leaves tall, flat walls - it's still work in progress I think). Warden sometimes appears in weird spots, like on the top of city walls (so you can see his entire body before unburrowing). He could have restriction to spawn in 3 x 3 area filled with solid blocks.</p>",

However, I still see a lot of room for improvement. Here are a few points-\n<br />1. I feel like the Deep Dark biome is just a bunch of regular caves with a few sculk patches, this really doesn't feel unique and is more like a regular cave with a catalysts spread out rather than the deep dark we saw at Minecraft Live 2020 and 2021. More sculk should generate on the floor, and should be more closely packed together.\n<br />2. It generates since y level 0, even though its supposed to be exclusive to the deepslate layer. \n<br />3. I understand that the Deep Dark is supposed to be a rare cave biome, but right now it's wayyy too rare. Using /locatebiome almost always says that it could not locate any such biome within a reasonable distance, and I usually have to teleport at least 2000 blocks away, and even then it's generally at least 1000 blocks away. \n<br />3. Swift Sneak is a really cool enchantment, but I don't understand why it's mutually exclusive with Depth Strider, Soul Speed and Frost Walker??? It doesn't affect the behaviour of any of these enchantments.</p>\n\n<p>Other than that, great work Mojang!</p>",

Even when the warden does spawn, it's pitifully easy to kill. You can pillar up a couple blocks, dig into a will, dig down a couple blocks, and suddenly it's no longer a threat. Even when I wasn't trying to hide or escape, I wasn't particularly worried because it's pathfinding is... not the greatest. I walked up some starts, walked a couple blocks down a walkway, and the warden was just sitting on the ground below me. It easily could have killed me if it was able to walk up the stairs, but it couldn't. I believe this could be resolved if the warden had an attack that was able to reach far away players. Whether it brings the warden to the player, brings the player to the warden, or is a projectile of some kind.</p>\n<p>That being said, the darkness effect is nearly perfect. Restricting the player's vision makes running from the warden much harder, and if the warden was able to effectively chase the player, then the warden would be a threat.</p>\n<p>I also feel like there could be better loot. All I ever saw in the chests were some health potions, bones, books, and various enchanted books. It feels pretty underwhelming for such a sprawling structure. Perhaps some level 3 potions could spawn rarely in the loot chests, so there's something more than just a single new enchantment to find there?</p>",

        "body": "<p>Howdy, Minecraft devs. I've been enjoying the aesthetic of the ancient cities and I really adore the killer sound design of the shrieker and the warden, however... everything else feels kind of underwhelming. With the constant hints at an anti-cheese mechanic it's a little disappointing that the warden is pretty barebones. Same goes for the deep dark biome - without the cities, their aesthetic is not so different from a normal cave. I trust that these will be remedied by the end of the experimental snapshots or the development cycle.</p>\n<p>That being said, I'd like to pitch my idea for a potential anti-cheese mechanic:</p>\n<p>- The warden has organs that allow itself to also function as a sculk catalyst.<br>- Should its prey be too high up to reach, it'll infect the atmosphere with sculk particles.<br>- The particles will latch onto nearby mobs and players, and slowly infect them. Once the process is complete, the entity just straight up dies.<br>- There are three ways to rid yourself of these particles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully submerging yourself in water. In this situation, you'll have to juggle between oxygen and the sculk.</li>\n<li>Rapid movement. In this situation, you'll probably have to deal with getting chased by the warden as well.</li>\n<li>Somehow waiting till the warden burrows back into the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>- On default, this death timer lasts 60 seconds, assuming moderate movement activity. This timer is reduced the more experience the player has, and it also gradually ramps up faster the more the player stays still or moves slowly.</p>",

There are too few Sculk Shriekers and there could stand to be slightly more sensors. Currently, my Warden cheesing idea of 'break the shriekers' seems to hold a lot of ground. How am I supposed to care about the Warden if I break the Sculk Shriekers? A good way to combat that is to ensure that there are always 2 shriekers with at least 2 sensors near eachother. If you only have 1 sensor, then that's broken and they can't activate. If you only have 1 shrieker, then you just break the shrieker directly. Now, a lot of newer players might not know that this is how the Warden is summoned at first, so this might not always be something that needs to exist, but for the knowledgable player, I believe this would end up being how you cheese the Warden if there are not more Sculk Shriekers made.\n<br />2.) The Deep Dark biome itself feels too spread out. There are too often just small patches of the biome, and it feels a little off. Bigger patches would be welcome.\n<br />3.) Oddly enough, Bats? These aren't too common down in the Deep Dark as they shouldn't be able to spawn, but if one wanders into the biome- its quite a blessing, should it be?\n<br />4.) Lastly, when spawning a bunch of mobs around the Warden, it seems to take a little too much time deciding who it wants to attack.</p>\n\n<p>I love everything else so far, and the feel is masterful.</p>",

Before too long I was able to loot one of the chests containing the new enchantment which I promptly equiped after mining some sculk blocks for more xp. <br>Then I decided to get the warden to come after me intentionally. So I built a bed, made a small cave saferoom into a wall with a 2 by 1 corridor that the warden can't fit through. I ran to a shrieker block and the warden spawned, I thought it was really cool how you keep hearing its heartbeat because with the blindness effect it was hard to see the warden that I fled from. I went into the saferoom I made and the warden got stuck outside the corridor and I could kill it very easily. I wish it was a little harder to cheese, maybe if it used projectiles when you're in a corridor. Overall a very solid start though!</p>",

I am older tho</p>\n<p><strong>Ancient</strong> <strong>City: </strong>Loot is far too poor to ever make a journey there. Even stronghold have the chance for mending, for free books, and serves a purpose for beating the game and getting endgame content anyway. Additionally, special versions similar to the Bastion would make it much more dynamic and fun to explore each time. The hard to break block in the city should also be able to be picked up, since it's a \"failed\" portal from as far as I can tell. If you plan to add a dimension later, make it only 'open in the Ancient City's bounding box or a special 'portal' bounding box.</p>\n<p><strong>Swift Sneak:</strong> Currently, this enchantment can be added on every item. Probably a bug. However, Swift Sneak <em>should</em> be a leg enchantment. We have a huge bloat of boot enchantments, and legs and chest currently have none outside of the ones you always add to endgame armor. Adding exclusive enchantments on top of it already being a rare enchantment requiring a lot of effort to get only makes me never get it. Having an enchantment that's actually usable makes me <em>want </em>to go get it. The example for myself is that I have never used Infinity since Mending came out.

I think that, as of right now, the biggest issue for me in this snapshot is that the risk/reward for the ancient cities really isn’t there yet. Aside from enchanted books, the only other valuable things you’re going to find down there are skeleton heads. The ancient city and the warden are going to be probably the most difficult challenge in the game to date, but aside from gathering sculk items for farms and getting swift sneak III there isn’t really much of an incentive to completely explore them. \n<br />As for what could fill these chests, I honestly think just a few valuable resources like god apples and diamonds would give players a lot more of a reason to thoroughly sweep out the ancient city. Additionally, the Otherside music disk could be moved to the ancient city lot chests, but I get the feeling that that’s already the plan.\n<br />As for swift sneak, I think it’s a really cool idea, but we have wayyyyy too many boots enchantments now (there are 5 unique boots enchantments and none for the chestplate!) So I think that the enchantment would work better on leggings, since you use your legs to sneak and stuff. I do agree that having all these enchantments at once is too much, so I’d say making soul speed incompatible with depth strider and frost walker would probably fix this issue, since swift sneak is more “generally useful” than soul speed and having swift sneak on your default gear would be more useful.</p>",

Having a \"sculk scream\" or something that could be used as a ranged attack would be very useful to discourage players from cheesing the fight. An attack that could send out the vibration particles and knock back the player off of a tower they'd built would be the perfect counter for any players using those tactics. Another enchantment would be nice, to go along with the \"Swift Sneak\" enchant, or possibly a totem that revives the player and also sends out said \"sculk scream\" to knock whatever killed the player far backwards...

I was trying to be sneaky and I was able to destroy a lot of shrieker and sensors without triggering the warden, although I did set off a few shriekers and was taking my time to destroy them in the best order to avoid setting them off. After getting most of the chests (only 3 left unlooted) the warden spawned which I think was good timing. It allows a player who's taking their time the ability to get all most of the loot and get out with a bit of luck. When heard the warden come out I immediately dug three blocks down and put a block above my head so I was completely enclosed and after a minute the warden despawned. This is where the flaw lies. I was then able to loot another city without being careful and just hiding underground when the warden came out. Once I couldn't dig myself out without triggering the warden again but I realized you could just mine away underground and come up somewhere else. I think that it's too easy to hide from the warden and just wait it out. Two ideas I had to combat this that aren't just make the warden break blocks is to make the darkness effect slow down your mining speed so that it's harder to mine away or make the warden able to smell you through one or two blocks. If not either of there than something has to be done to make avoiding the warden a challenge, and not just a minute.</p>",

The new enchantment looks good, but very limited, so it's definitely not enough to get players there, at the risk of \"losing more than winning\".<br>- I also think the warden should be able to break blocks like webs, he seems strong enough for that and some players could use it against him.</p>\n<p>This is my feedback, I tried it in survival and it was really challenging, I tried to avoid it without abusing its weaknesses, like climbing blocks or hiding, and it was really fun, but other players can abuse this and break the experience, so I advise thinking in solutions for this.</p>",

        "body": "<p>cons: From my experiance, the warden was very easy to run away from, I think he should be faster then you while normal running, and equal speed as you while jump running. Also you can easily just go only 2 blocks up and he can't hit you, maby the warden could go up blocks like a spider. Another thing is you can kill the warden using a fishing rod and fall damage, I think that the warden should't take fall damage and if you hook the waden he will pull you to him. I feel like having multiple NATURALY spawn warden is kinda broken, by my experience, the skulk screker would't activate if a warden was in a 24 blocks radiuce, witch is way to small.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>pros: I like the fact that the warden can go true a 1 block space even tho he is 3 blocks wide, it makes it easier for him to chase you around. The game play of the ancient city reminds me alot of the mobile game \"granny\" .&nbsp;</p>\n<p>reinforced deepslate: it is really cool that you can move it with piston and blast resistant. Also the fact that it is resistent to wither makes it possible to make moveble wither cage witch can be use to make crazy obsidian farm.</p>\n<pre><em>(sorry for bad english spelling i am french)</em></pre>",

Being the warden an extremely powerful monster, the loot should be more valuable for the player to risk entering the underground cities.

I shouldn't be able to go through the Deep Dark AND the City with just wooden tools. Something needs to actually pose a threat, which isn't happening with the lack of Shriekers.<br>Sculk Blobs w/ Catalysts need to be MUCH more common as well. At the moment it just doesn't feel like the Deep Dark, increasing the size and frequency of these will build the immersion and look much better.<br>Some Sculk Growths should have a large radius and use noise to generate, crawling on floors, walls and ceilings.<br><strong>WARDEN:</strong><br>The Warden should be able to dig through player's barriers and towers like a mole, they NEED a proper punishment if they can't sneak and avoid the Warden properly. <br>The Warden should be able to dig through the walls of caves to follow a player/mob it's angry at so it can't escape just by walking away.<br>Use EyeFeature overlays for the Warden. You can change the alpha of them dynamically by setting the Red, Green, and Blue values below 1.0f at the same time. It looks MUCH cleaner than the current Warden overlays.</p>",

I found myself using snowballs strategically to snag chest loot quickly when the warden was active, and if I had made mistakes in stealthing I would have likely been killed. I playtested again, but with the intent to try and ‘cheese’ the encounters. Like others have said, it seems it’s too easy to simply dig into a wall or stack upwards to avoid the warden, however I assume this might be combated against with some anti-cheese mechanics. The main ways I found you could easily avoid the warden was using a lava bucket (it moves very slowly through lava), stacking up, digging into a wall, and blocking it’s path to the player off within one of the ancient city corridors.</p>\n\n<p>- I did enjoy each interactions I had, I love the Minecraft horror feeling that the warden invokes. It’s animations are executed wonderfully, and the sound design is especially effective. The darkness effect adds a great stressfully claustrophobic feeling I hadn’t felt before as well. The only thing I’d note is that when the warden screams before charging it’s target, it doesn’t seem it’s scream is ferocious or audible enough to me.</p>\n\n<p>- I would say it’s scariness is limited by how you can avoid it quite easy, but the general horror ambience is set perfectly. Once those avoidance strategies are dealt with I believe the warden will be in a great state.</p>",

You guys have really nailed this, Minecraft’s sound design has always been gorgeous but this is a whole other level. Hearing the shrieker go off and hearing the warden dig out of the ground is horrifying!! Also, I play with subtitles (I’m not hard of hearing I just think they’re useful) and the phrases “warden approaches” and “warden advances” when the shrieker doesn’t spawn the warden immediately gave me some goosebumps. </p>\n\n<p>The darkness effects works wonders too, while it was active I was always battling in my head whether to place a torch down to see better or not, because I didn’t want to set the warden after me. A bug I noticed is that the icon doesn’t appear in the top right while it’s active, only can be seen in the inventory.</p>\n\n<p>Sadly, when you look at what the warden actually does it’s a bit underwhelming because of how easy it is to cheese. I always thought hoglin were a great hostile mob because they had a long attack reach, even when you’re separated by a black they can still get hits on you. The warden needs a much longer range, it should still be able to hit you when you’ve built 3-4 blocks up. If it is unable to reach your position at all, it should enter a second phase. He would start giving you nausea and making your player character slowly move towards the warden’s position. It could also climb maybe, it digs, why not climb up wall, maybe it would be limited to flat wall tho.</p>",

Right now, one Warden isn't enough as it kept getting distracted by random mobs, and it takes too long for Wardens to kill players &amp; other mobs due to the animations, and they're often out of reach. Wardens spawning outside of the deep dark biome is great for minigames, but it'd be cool if you can nametag a Warden to prevent it from despawning.</p>\n<p>I really like its high health and damage, PvE combat becomes fun again for fully maxed-out players.

It's not the same if most of the city is free of the stuff.</p>\n<p>-Sneaking was neat, and I liked how the Warden can get distracted by bats, it gives a new utility to bats that is very much welcome.</p>\n<p>-I didn't loot many chests, but when I opened them it wasn't very clear when did they make noise and when they did not.</p>\n<p>-Darkness felt extremely claustrophobic! I think this mechanic is spot on.</p>\n<p>-Pretty scared, to be fair. Having to deal with a close Warden is a big problem, but I loved it when I tried to run and ended up spawning two!</p>\n<p>I also love that the Warden is immune to knockback, it makes it look like a heavy, immovable beast. Maybe you could make it so it's unnafected by water? That way it wouldn't get easily stuck/pushed away.</p>\n<p>Also, one of the devs posted on Twitter a meme with the Warden with a fishing rod and I kind of think that's exactly what it should have to avoid the players cheesing it! Think about it! If you tower up, it can pull you down. If you hide in a tunnel, it can pull you out. If you throw it into a lava pool, it can pull you in with him! I'd make it only do this attack when it's angered and \"knows\" where you are but you're out of melee range.</p>\n<p>I hope you take these ideas into consideration.

The Warden and the Deep Dark Cities look amazing from a texturing standpoint, as well as modeling and structure building. The sounds of everything is superb, especially the Warden. Further the movements of the Warden are unique and creepy, perfect for the situation. Hats off to the entire Mojang team.</p>\n<p>Some of the issues are likely repeats from others, but the Warden has some issues functionally. Being able to tower up to attack the Warden without fear is no good, and needs some kind of way to either knock the player off the pillar, hit them with a projectile, or allow the Warden to climb or jump high. Secondly the Warden should be lava resistant as it is too easy to kill that way. It also needs to be able to swim and breathe underwater as it drowns easily. And also to an extent, it needs to ignore bats or always prioritize the player as its main target.</p>\n<p>In order to keep the creepy factor, I think in some way allowing the darkness effect to be lessened should perhaps be limited to a command instead of a menu slider that people will cheese to make it easier.</p>\n<p>I also think in some way, the Deep Dark biome needs some alterations to differentiate itself from other biomes besides carrying the city in it and the random blobs of Sculk, and should perhaps also only spawn below y=0, a risk versus reward for digging further down. (Plus it is the \"Deep\" Dark). Adding unique music or plants could help with that.</p>\n<p>Excellent job!</p>",

Overall though, they did feel enjoyable, although scary. I thought the darkness effect was a bit over the top. It was almost impossible to see where I was going and had to turn the darkness effect down to around 60-70 % in order for it to be at least possible. I think setting the default lower would help. A couple ore general things: I think that the loot in the chests should be slightly more worth it, and I also think that there should be a little more lighting, considering that every torch you place activates the skulk. also, in the middle you can't even see the warden statue, and only the fire.</p>",

I believe they should gather around the chests/loot they are trying to protect so if they lose agro on the player they default back to chests. They also seem too distracted by other mobs especially bats, making them even easier to avoid. I also think if the warden does as much damage as it currently does then it needs less health, or more health and less damage. Nothing too drastic but some balancing with health/damage would be nice. It also feels too unrewarding to defeat the warden in it's current state, mob drops aren't the only way to do this so it's understandable that it doesn't drop anything but some sort of achievement or perhaps a special chest/loot gets unlocked when it's defeated and you'd have to find it, maybe it was buried in reinforced deep slate and is now accessible after killing the Warden. </p>",

I think it should only generate in the negative Y range as  it's the \"Deep Dark\" so works better in the deepest layers of the world.\n<br />The Warden is almost challenging, if you decide to stay on the ground it delivers a new and unique experience to the game. As mentioned by other players though it's all too easy to pillar up and 'cheese it'. \n<br />If the Warden doesn't drop any loot I see no reason why the player needs to kill it, so if the player is within sword reach it should be able to reach/jump up and hit you. \n<br />This would leave pillaring up as a viable escape option but not an easy kill option. One other option is that we know from the Warden's spawn animation that it can move through solid deepslate so maybe if the player uses the wrong material to tower up the Warden can climb through it without destroying blocks.\n<br />The loot chests definitely need a buff, the new enchantment of swift sneek is cool but it's not enough to risk a hardcore world for (as an example). Also I'm not a big fan of having to change armor for different scenarios, it slows the game down and clogs up the inventory, so maybe stick it on the leggings instead.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe another treasure enchantment or a new unbrewable potion in the chests could counteract the new blindness status effect, like whoever built these ancient cities discovered ways to counteract the Warden - the wool paths and swift sneek already suggest this.\n<br />Can't wait for more!</p>",

Yes and no, when the warden could pathfind me correctly it was almost impossible to get away (maybe less sniffing every 2 seconds) , very easy to escape however due to the layout of the deep caves colliding with the collapsed city, I enjoyed the horror however it could be quickly broken by the bad pathfinding on top of this the warden makes extremely loud noises making it feel like hes 10 blocks away when hes 40.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Were you able to figure out how to sneak around the Warden? The use of snowballs made it easier to sneak around the warden however sneaking around two was unfair. Only one warden should be active at a time due to his ability to decimate you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe how the darkness effect felt. The darkness made the warden horrifying, seeing the blue approach in the thin hallway was gut punching, the pulsing effect removes some fear however, instead it should be 10 seconds of complete dark, then 10 more seconds and it should expand the darkness. IMO this would make it scarier as you're completely shrouded for a bit then relaxed but the fear is there.</li>\n<li>Overall it was a little disappointing as the loot was rather lackluster, in other words high risk, low reward, the warden and the sculk work extremely well but is let down by other things such as the city structure and how little the sculk appear in regular caves, I will make another comment addressing more.</li>\n</ul>",

        "body": "<p>While everyone else was messing with the Warden, I was focused on the Sculk Catalyst and Blocks. I currently have two issues with how the Sculk works in Java:</p>\n<p>1. The generation is much too random. Even if you give it a 3 wide stone generator and drop mobs from below, it prefers to spread into the rest of the generator and apply Sculk Veins, instead of localize where the mob died and focus on converting the closest blocks. In the Bedrock Betas, it seemed to have a central 3x3 grid where it would always convert if possible with the randomness being extended out from there. That would be preferable to completely random that tends to spread out, especially if its purpose is to be used for mob farms.</p>\n<p>2. Sculk doesn't seem to give much XP. Maybe it's just me, but even after converting a decent chunk of a plain with Zombie Piglins, I feel the XP largely isn't worth it for the amount of time it takes. If Sculk is meant to be the alternative to the many more efficient ways to get XP, some of which were stated to be bugs (Piglins, Trident Killers, etc.), the base XP should be increased. Another idea to add to the base XP increase would be to allow Fortune to influence XP gains from Sculk for Hoes, with Fortune 3 giving a chance to score HUGE XP from only a few blocks. It would also give a reason for the Seriously Dedicated to put something other than Silk Touch on their Netherite Hoes.</p>\n<p>TL;DR: Make the Sculk Catalyst generate more on the point of death, and give Sculk more XP.</p>",

Ideally, if lava and potions can't kill the warden, bow fights would be the only way -- so maybe when it gets mad it'll perform this? With the goal being that it'll deal enough damage / frequency to kill the player before the warden itself gets killed. Extra props if it's in a series of much tinier hits per \"wave\"... helps players who run, hurts those who pillar.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Named wardens should not be able to burrow</p>\n<p>4. Once it charges, it should be faster than the player unless line of sight (line of... sound?) gets broken, then slowing back down to its current charge speed or less. That would encourage speed potions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, fantastic, it would be great even if this was its final form.

I think a solution is to give the warden the skill to sneak or crawl.&nbsp;If the player build himself in, a solution is, the warden can dig hisself to the player.A other skill can be to make a jump attack. Maybe he can sneek himself to the player. There is sooo much potential.</p>\n<p>Because of I am from German, I hope my Englisch isn´t to bad xD</p>",

The warden was in my opinion quite challenging, I enjoyed the scary feeling and the feeling on being impossibly weak against it and having to lure it away instead of killing it.</p>\n<p>2. I sometimes encoutered one when opening chests or being a bit careless, I also found him emerging due to the scructure sometimes needing you to break/place blocks wich greates vibrations, it felt like you are in trouble once you hear the sound of a warden emerging from the ground making me run to the wool patch in the city.</p>\n<p>3.Yes i did, by sneaking and throwing/shooting projectiles to lure him away, i really liked the sniffing feature where just being quiet isn't enough and the agression mechanic makes every mistake fatal.</p>\n<p>4. Yes, by sneaking and analyzing the sculk sensors and shriekers you can figure out how to avoid it, careful wool placement also helps, in my opinion its like a puzzle to not anger the warden when looting and i like it.</p>\n<p>5. It made the warden twice as scary, the fact that you can't see the warden very well makes it hard to locate it, it made the audio heartbeats much more useful, as it helps locate the warden.</p>\n<p>6. Quite scared, i felt nearly powerless against the warden, the darkness effect made it so you feel like it could come from any direction, and the heartbeats make you extra scared.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

If the room with the skulls generates in water, then the 2 soul fires in the room will stay lit underwater and the skulls will instantly break.&nbsp;<br>Additionally, the sculk sensors above the lamps in front of the reinforced deepslate structure seem to always be waterlogged by default. This can cause the water to flow out of the lamp tower.&nbsp;<br><br>For the deep dark biome, the first one I went to had almost no caves and absolutely no sculk, the second one had a very large area (around 300 by 200 blocks) with no caves as well and only had a very small patch of sculk on the very edge of the biome. When near a city, the sculk seems to generate much better.&nbsp;<br><br><br>Otherwise, I am finding the atmosphere of the deep dark cities to be right with what was being aimed for and I know that it is planned for the warden to have measures to prevent towering up 4 blocks, so overall it is a fun experience when played intentionally and the city is not underwater or mostly underground.&nbsp;</p>",

Despite all of that, I still found the warden to be pretty scary. As for the deep dark, I think the biome itself can use a little more work to make it more atmospheric. Adding some exclusive ambient sounds or music like the one heard in Minecraft live 2021 can make the biome a lot scarier. Additionally, I feel like the deep dark doesn't feel much like a unique biome but rather just a bunch of small clusters of sculk scattered around. I think adding some type of animated sculk vines hanging from the ceiling can make it much more atmospheric. Perhaps some can even drag the player up if they're not careful.</p>\n<p>Another problem with the deep dark biome is that there isn't much of an incentive to go out and risk finding one without an ancient city. I feel like the biome is too reliant on the structure and struggles to stand independently. I think one thing you can do is make it so rare ores like diamonds are a bit more common in the biome and there is a chance to maybe find a small cabin with some decent loot like the one in Minecraft live 2020. I also feel like the biome itself should be a little more common but be found way lower than y:0 instead y:30.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for the ancient cities, I'm quite happy with how they look and their rarity. The only real issue I have is that the loot should be better.</p>",

Obviously the sensor was designed for that and still has issues that need to be addressed, but I think myself and many others would like to be able to use the warden in our minigames as well. With them disappearing back into the ground uncontrollably this becomes very difficult, since the infrastructure has to be present to respawn them every so often, which makes it impossible to -- for instance -- trap them in a specific room. It feels very strange that the convention of named mobs not despawning doesn't apply to the warden, as I see no clear gameplay advantage to that, it's unnecessarily limiting. By the same token, having skulk shriekers summon a warden even outside of caves and the deep dark seems a bit strange, but if that is going to be the case maybe it could be light-dependent? I would like to be able to give players the darkness effect without spawning a warden, and currently that seems impossible. Overall the whole team has done an amazing job with this, all's left is tuning!</p>",

But, I would prefer that to not be the case, <em>ever</em>. You see, with the addition of the Ancient City in the \"<a href=\"https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/a-very-scary-snapshot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Very Scary Snapshot</a>,\" there was a new block added that cannot be harvested, much like how Budding Amethyst works. So I was thinking: What if we add an interactive object in the Ancient City. Making it worth the trouble of knowing where it is, and an easy way to re-access it so that the player can go there to interact with this object once more.</p>\n<p>As such, I propose the \"Soulfire Forge,\" a special forging block that allows you to progress further beyond Netherite. The forge would require fire ignited on soul sand/soil underneath to be able to function, and cannot be moved by pistons, and cannot be harvested by any means.</p>\n<p>Another use for this interactive block would be the ability to upgrade the Elytra, such as giving it Armor <em><strong>or</strong></em> increasing Flight Retainment, where it will allow you to fly longer with less need of rockets.</p>\n<p>Placing a villager near this block... ... ???</p>",

It got so dark inside of caves that it become impossible to see the warden itself thus reducing the fear brought upon the player by the environment.&nbsp; The darkness effect's fog range should pulse alongside the \"default\" pulse that the effect already has. It also should not affect the emissive layer of the warden itself.</p>\n<p><strong>Warden</strong><br>As of right now, the warden feels too derpy. It often gets distracted by bats (which shouldn't spawn in the deep dark) or gets stuck in crevices. This comes down to a level design problem (touched upon later) inside the cities and deep dark though as well as mob functionality. <br><br>The mob should be able to crawl up blocks or create some sculk that it can traverse through in some manner in order to get out of places or to hit pesky players that have towered up. In my opinion, it should also be able to function as a catalyst itself and spread sculk when it kills mobs.&nbsp;<br><br>The hitbox itself also does not make much sense for the stature of the mob. I understand that it's supposed to 'crawl' through narrower spaces but its animations don't reflect that.&nbsp;<br><br>The warden also seems to have a very long delay between knowing about a creature and actually going to that creature.<br><br><br></p>",

Make them run fast when in lava/water, as if they don't like liquid. Currently lava buckets can easily kill a group of Wardens.</p>\n<p>Give Wardens the same reach as the player's sword to prevent 3-block tower strategies. It's strange that this tall Warden mob can't even reach players that are 2 blocks high.</p>\n<p>If a summoned Warden becomes angry at a mob, the Warden should also summon weak (but scary!) soul entities that go through blocks, attacking the mob. It should knock players off their towers. These soul entities can also help get rid of bats and other mobs that are out of the Warden's reach. Creepers shouldn't explode from getting attacked by these.</p>\n<p>Lastly, add more sculk material in the deep dark biome &amp; city, it'll look much better.</p>\n<p>These solutions should increase the difficulty of the Warden a little bit, while still giving players viable but harder options to cheese the Warden!</p>",

I understand wanting to light up the area but the abundant amount of dense low-light emitting sources are contradictory to the goal of wanting to submerge the player in darkness.&nbsp;<br>Instead, an alternative solution could be to make a variant of the sculk vein that emits light or add a sculk-lamp-like block that lights up the surrounding area.<br><br>The sculk network should communicate with each other to give away the player's location instead of only communicating directly with shriekers and the warden. The sculk patches also should be wider and interconnect more to achieve a more fungus-network-like aesthetic of communicating sculk.<br><br></p>",

My suggestion would be to up the default warden tracker to 3-5 triggers and also make the shriekers attempt to shriek before being broken.<br><br>This ties into another point which is that looting the chests in the city was incredibly easy.

The animations are smooth and the sounds make it especially terrifying! The entire idea for a mob relying on sound rather than sight is extremely creative.<br>The darkness effect increases fear in a balanced way, being unable to tell whether the Warden is far away or right around the corner, with the pulses giving you some relief. This works very well combined with the heartbeat sound being consistently loud, making you unable to easily gauge distance.<br>The ancient cities themselves! The lore possibilities are almost endless, especially interesting are the nether materials and the frame blocks... new dimension confirmed? :D</p>",

Not only that the warden was summon in other places.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>While Experimenting, I found It funny that it can hear anything but Note blocks/Jukeboxes. I feel it should be a feature because it's considered a sound. The strike animation is rather weird; his arms go inside his body. Also, Not every sound is Taken!&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The darkness effect seems to be stable!</li>\n<li>The sneaking was pretty easy. Maybe too easy. All I had to do was hide in a wall. I wish the warden could be summoned near the player besides near the sculk shriekers to intensify the player. Another thing, If the player starts to run while the warden is crawling up, it should automatically run to the position the player was previously spotted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, the warden is pretty easy and the structure can also be improved. I feel as the warden can be a little more intelligent.</p>\n<p>P.S. It's very cute!! It's like he's sleeping, and he doesn't want to be disturbed. Even when you try to summon him outside, he moans and practically says, \"NOT NOW, MOM, I'm SLEEPING!!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Other mobs like skeletons creepers and zombies should either be scared of the warden and run away or stay still and hide.</li>\n<li>To make the deep dark feel more immersive i suggest removing aquifers and lava pools, have the biome be filled with more sculk instead of having only small patches in random places.

If they would glow (as in the souls on it) it could make them easier to find and kill, while also making for an interesting light source. They should be broken with projectiles. Should have to be triggered multiple times, otherwise it is hard to break them when others are nearby.</p>\n<p>The Swift Sneak enchantment should be more common, I spent ages trying to find an ancient city and when I did, none of the chests seemed to have it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maybe an enchantment that silences tools or blocks the Warden's smell? I don't really like the whole smell thing because you can't do anything about it, and everything else is about sound.

As of now it just looks like a weird portal in the middle, with those paths branching off of them into nowhere with random smaller structures next to them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;It could be helped if the structures looked more like actual old houses or similar, wich are a bit more connected to the main paths. The walkways shouldnt have the wall in the middle of them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• I wish there was something more interesting to find at the „portal“ structure in the middle, even if it only was proper walkways. Rigt now its just a bunch of walls. The Pathways dont even connect to it properly.</p>\n<p>• The way the structures cut into the terrain looks too artificial, the resulting walls are too flat. I would love to see it looking like whoever has built the ancient cities built their houses into a cave rather than a cave around their houses.</p>\n<p>Overall im kind of disapointed by the snapshot, at the same time we have to keep in mind this&nbsp;<em>is&nbsp;</em>the very first snapshot, so things are expected to be far from being finished.</p>\n<p>I hope Mojang will take this into consideration, if theyre not already working on it, to make the ancient cities more worth it exploring.</p>",

However, it’s too easy to cheese the warden by pillaring up a few blocks where it can’t reach you to kill it. I suggest to make the warden be able to dig back underground and dig back up somewhere it can reach the player, or on top of the 3 block pillar the player made, or maybe a shockwave attack when it gets very angry that knocks the player back. Also, there needs to be more of an incentive to go to the cities, other than the swift sneak enchantment and the sculk blocks. Right now, I wouldn’t really raid a city in survival as the risk isn’t worth the reward. If the reinforced deep slate was given a larger use, or if the chests had much better loot, then it would be more balanced. Finally, as for the structure, there should maybe be more rooms and structures amid the tunnels so they don’t always dead end. Other than that, the cities are absolutely stunning, and the warden and darkness effect give the perfect amount of fear. The swift sneak enchantment is also useful for building, and I agree that it should be mutually exclusive with depth strider to make it balanced.</p>",

Firstly, it can have some kind of attack when it gets very angry that’s long distance and knocks the player back multiple blocks, dealing a decent amount of damage. Also, if it can’t reach the player, it should dig back into the ground and dig back up somewhere it can reach it to attack it.</p>\n\n<p>Also, this is hard to describe, but I think the idea of the warden should be adjusted a little. I think it should seem as one mob in the city rather than many, and it’s only that one warden in the city, which would make it seem more like a boss or mini boss than just a difficult mob. What I mean is that the player should only be able to spawn one at a time in a city, and whenever the warden digs back into the ground, it will not be able to dig back up again until after a short cooldown, giving the player some time to loot the city without the warden spawning until it’s ready again.

I was able to loot a couple, but I also wanted to note like so many others that the loot there is not the greatest for the trouble you have to put in to get to it.</p>\n<p>5. The darkness effect was perfect! It made the Warden harder to dodge, I could never know exactly what it was going to do or where it was.</p>\n<p>6. It was more startling and edging than scary, as it could jump out at you at any time, while you knew it was there, but not where it was.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As I've seen everybody else mention is it's insanely easy to cheese. Obviously, though, this is what the snapshot is for. I wish the Warden maybe dropped some kind of item that could let you craft the sensor or the catalyst, even if it is rare to get. I wish it would drop XP, because it's a very powerful mob that many early or mid game players might not be able to defeat without building a pillar or digging a hole. I've read about people mentioning this too, but it should be able to go against the flow of water. Killing it by by lava makes sense, since it's an entity mainly composed of plant-like material, and it also has a vital organ exposed. What if whenever it sensed lava nearby, it would grow a protective layer of some organic stone to protect its' body and heart?</p>",

I was testing Warden in creative mode and decided to get him to defend a village from a raid. I locked villagers in houses, gave myself Bad Omen effect and spawned \"the defender\". It was funny to see its constantly roaring at illagers and killing them in one hit, but one thing interrupted the fun. Villagers were panicking in their houses and of course they were making noise, so Warden raged at them and tried to kill them. Currently, it's chasing mobs that have made its angry, and it doesn't care about other mobs. So it just stood next to the house, not being able to kill the villagers, while raiders were running really loudly all over the village. It took a while before Warden began to pursue illagers again.</p>\n<p>I think it should forget sooner about prey it can't reach. I know it'll have its ways to always track down its prey, but sometimes it won't be able to reach its prey (e. g. in a small tunnel), and it shouldn't just stay here and \"staring\" at the source of noise.</p>",

The deep dark biome itself seems to spawn above 0 idk if this is a bug or not, but the look of the biome leaves a bit to be desired. the entire place is just regular deepslate with separated blobs of sculk. it would be nice if the blobs were connected by the veins or sort of \"gravitated\" towards each other, makes figuring out which way the biome continues way easier. The cities look amazing, the lights and the frame are gorgeous. my only problem with them is the loot, 1 enchantment isn't enough to risk exposing myself to that big of a danger. My original speculation for the deep dark was that it was going to be a place to find the most diamonds. Tone down the diamond ore spawns in general and make them more common in the deep dark. This would add a new strategy to mining by having to strategically avoid making sounds and it adds a high risk and high reward factor. Casual players could avoid the danger but get less diamonds but those who risk it could get a good amount. This idea needs a lot of balancing and i'm 100% sure mojang won't add it but felt like throwing it out there.<br><br>Great snapshot overall. Very excited for more, you guys killed it!</p>",

Here are my first impressions.</p>\n<p>(Disclaimer: I know that this is a VERY EARLY build of the Warden, Sculk, and Cities.)</p>\n<p>- Stated before by others, but yes, it is very easy to cheese the Warden, but I've been following and I know that solutions are being worked on for it to combat pillaring and digging into walls to escape it.</p>\n<p>- Animations and sound design for the Warden are flawless. I applaud everyone who worked on this sluggish monster!</p>\n<p>- This might be a personal thing or I did something wrong, but the Warden is WAY too easy to summon. Set off the shrieker once, and usually, pow it emerges from the ground. It... feels kind of unfair and makes scavenging chests or exploring in general kind of impossible. THAT MIGHT BE INTENTIONAL, as it is suppose to be challenging, but this just feels kind of pushing it.</p>\n<p>- While the Deep Dark does contain the cities, the biome itself still feels... kind of empty. Just splotches of the sculk here and there and that's about it. Good, but it just feels completely empty until you find the city. That is intentional, I know, as it is supposed to be a rather dead, quiet, and enclosed biome, but it just feels... less like a biome and more of a \"oh look, a bunch of sculk puddles in a cave,\" until you find the city.</p>\n<p>- The Ancient Cities are INCREDIBLY well done. Massive, infested, and abandoned. But the one complaint is it's generation is kind of... weird. It cuts into the terrain generation and feels clunky.</p>",

The amount of challenge, risk, and especially the time trying to look for them is simply not worth it. Its especially difficult when the city is flooded by lava/water. Functional Skulk blocks and the super rare chance of getting swift sneak are the only incentives to explore. In my opinion I dont think its enough. I would reccomend adding unique and useful blocks (like the currently unintended moveable wither-proof reinforced deepslate) and or better / unique loot items. Thus, there would be a reason for players to visit (not including the initial visit players will make for the novelty).

Also as mentioned he has problems with moving around. The warden being more agile (being able to get past certain obstacles, locating the player easier, jumping down if he has to) would make him alot better.&nbsp;The darkness effect on the default settings (100% darkening) makes warden encounters either blindly sneaking in one direction and hoping you dont step on a sculk sensor or waiting until he despawns and the effect disappears.The loot definetly should be buffed, maybe with a unique item or two from the chests. Maybe diffrent loottables depending on where you find the chest, kinda like bastions. The deep dark biome outside the ancient city is kinda underwhelming, more varied blobs of sculk in terms of size and shape and it spawning on walls / ceiling + maybe some particle effects would liven it up a bit. Even with all that its still very cool good job :))</p>",

This makes many parts of the ancient cities uncovered by any sculk due to how large they are. I think the majority of blocks in a deep dark biome should be covered by skulk veins, with the other skulk blocks like shriekers remaining spaced as is. The deep dark also appears too high up. It should be below Y0 as previously planned. I also think the ancient cities are too rare and too large, which could be fixed with additional variants that have smaller sizes like with Bastions.</p>\n<p>The shriekers also summon too many Wardens. When the first Warden spawns, there should be more time until another one can spawn. They also shouldn't despawn as quickly as they do. In regards to the cheasing problem, I don't think making them climb would help since players would just switch to tunneling instead. They should have some sort of ranged attack. Two ideas I have would be a sort of sound wave blast which goes along with the sound theme, or a vine that can pull in players like The Monster of the Ocean Depths from the 2017 mob vote.</p>",

But since it's an EXPERIMENTAL snapshot I'll stray from the loot since I hope it's a placeholder.</p>\n\n<p>But yeah my main concern is the design of the Ancient Cities. It feels more like a Nether Fortress than a new cool structure like the Bastions. Just long corridors that yes, are large like a Nether Fortress, but there's nothing unique besides the centerpiece. </p>\n\n<p>With Bastions you had different variations of the remnants and sure cause they were remnants and with the cities that might be a bit much. </p>\n\n<p>However there is nothing that stands out about the rooms that branch off from the Ancient Cities. I would expect houses or something, maybe even a barracks for weapon loot but no. </p>\n\n<p>If I could change something, it would be the size and variation of the cities. Perhaps higher points in the city besides the centerpiece. Like multiple floors or maybe some that spiral downwards. Having bastions in mind here ofc.. </p>\n\n<p>maybe even a lore mural hidden somewhere in fragments?</p>\n\n<p>And finally the Deep Dark itself. There is nothing really unique about it. Sculk patches in a regular deepslate cave is a bit underwhelming in terms of content. Maybe like sculk springs or more interesting formations in the deep dark. And maybe something like harvesting sculk from spreading constantly? Sculk Falls? Soul geysers? Something unique...</p>",

One idea I had was for the Warden to basically hide inside the ground when it can't get to a player, and then when it realizes it can reach the player again (if the player got off the pillar or something), it immediately pops up and begins chasing again. I think this would lure the player into a sense of false security and be quite terrifying. You wouldn't know if the Warden was actually gone, or if it had just gone into hiding.</p>",

Speed Swift is cool but something I don't think ill ever actually use over depth strider and soul speed. I know there is more loot planned that would be unique to the chests but I think two already existing items should be added to the loot tables: Enchanted Golden Apples and Otherside. The current best way to get enchanted golden apples is flying around a desert looking for temples. This is ridiculously easy to do, so for a structure much more complex and difficult it deservers a high probability of enchanted golden apples. Otherside imo is already way to rare (i spent hours looking through over 50 dungeons on an smp and I never found one myself) so it deservers a hard structure with high probability<br><strong>2. Warden</strong><br>I love how the warden feels, it is very easy to cheese however. My thoughts is that if you pillar up the warden will be able to jump up and hit you with hard knockback, knocking the player off their pillar. Maybe the warden should be able to swim faster in lava to prevent more cheesing<br><strong>3. Reinforced Deepslate<br></strong>The idea of reinforced deepslate is amazing, I love how it cant be obtained but can be pushed with pistons. wither immune so perfect for wither traps. I know it was unintentional, but i'd love if it stayed in.</p>",

However, the Warden is incredibly cheeseable at the moment, as water, bats, 3 block pillars, tiny holes etc. just make the Warden feel less scary then it should be. When it doesn't get stuck though, it feel terrifying trying to get away from it with only iron armor and not being able to see where you're going with the Darkness effect.</p>\n<p>To make it more of a threat, I feel that since there are Sculk Veins already, Wardens could summon a Veins Entity if it can't reach it's target within a certain time frame. After a telegraph of about a second, they quickly start chasing the target with the speed of an angry Enderman, going around corners if it needs to. You could also be able to outsmart the Veins and tangle them, which will make the Veins Entity go back to where it was summoned and despawn. The Warden should also have some sort of regeneration so that you can't just End Crystal it, as it feels cheep.</p>\n<p>Other than that, the Deep Dark biome feels a bit boring without a city, as it's just patches of Sculk. Larger more connected patches along with a Sculk themed light source would be cool. Overall though, I'm really looking forward to whats in store with the Deep Dark and hope that more interesting things like this are done in future updates.</p>",

I would have imagined the caves to be covered in sculk everywhere, very creepy. But its mostly small areas, looking like regular caves with small sad occasional piles of sculk. I would Increase the sculk in the deep dark a lot; put it on the ceiling, floor, walls etc.</p>\n<p>About the Warden; first it is constantly distracted with bats. And ignoring the player. But the main issue is that its so easy to \"cheese\". He can only jump one block, get stuck in water, stuck in lava. He needs to be able to counter pillaring. Like make the warden be able to climb walls if angry for a few blocks (even a few high, or make him able to jump higher), this way not giving the ability to break blocks but still counter easy cheese. Or give the warden same attack reach as a player, if we can hit him, he can hit us.</p>\n<p>And I hope that nametag a warden would prevent him from digging back down.</p>",

I enjoy how rare the Ancient city structure is but I feel like the Deep Dark itself is either too rare or not big enough when it generates. I think the Warden encounters were great to start. Him emerging and searching for the player is really well done, but the entire tension and fear of it is broken when he hears a bat and goes running around with it. It (IMO) breaks the entire feel of the Warden. Maybe make the warden immune to hearing bats? Or make it so he takes priority on the player rather than mobs. Otherwise, the challenge of looting the cities and moving around the warden is a fun new experience, I wouldn't say as hard as something like a bastion, but different. I think the Warden gets trapped in water way too much, making him very easy to avoid or cheese in combat. I feel like he should be able to move through water without a hindrance or make water not affect him at all. When I encountered the Warden, in all my times not just the first, I found the noise and experience as really well done, the audio plays a massive part. I think the Darkness effect is okay, (IMO) way too overkill. I get it's supposed to be a counter for cheesing and adding tension but I can't even see a single block in front of me. Maybe it should be toned down a bit? All in all, I love the feel, the sounds, and the Warden. However, I think it has more room to grow.</p>",

The extremely low light level, the skull echo noises, the insane size of the biome, all contribute to this incredible sense of atmosphere. The one bit of feedback I would add is some horror-esque music would be an amazing touch here, as the music used in the Minecraft live 2021 presentation of the deep dark was especially fitting, and would be amazing to have in the background while moving quietly and carefully. Anything atmospheric like this and scary for music would work really nicely. </p>\n\n<p>My first encounter with the warden was certainly memorable, but I realized after about 30 seconds of hiding that the warden couldn’t reach me where I was (two blocks up on some castle-like wall), no matter where I would walk along it. I know a solution is coming for this, but I think an ability to climb for the warden would be the best solution, and not just a projectile. The reason is because the warden doesn’t have clever enough pathfinding to be a threat to you on these walls, even with a projectile. I could easily move away if it shoots at me, but if it follows me up the wall I’m screwed, which is what I want. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, I think shriekers should be close together so as to make it so that avoiding spawning the warden is nearly impossible without sneaking everywhere. One shrieker is east to get deal with, but multiple shriekers means the warden will be summoned if you try to remove them. </p>",

I flew around one in creative after play testing in survival just to get an idea of the loot this structure has to offer, (especially for how rare they are) and to be quite honest I do not see a player incentive to enter the structure. The design of the structure is amazing and was really fun to explore in both a survival and creative setting, but the loot table makes it entirely avoidable. This needs to be looked at, the risk for reward is just not worth it. </p>\n\n<p>The Warden is easily the most challenging mob in the game. I don't have any great ideas for a loot table except for maybe an overworld-like take on the piglin bastion loot if that makes any sense. I hope this reaches the devs and that my feedback is considered.

There are a few glitches ive found such as the warden just disappearing randomly while testing them on the surface and they gets stuck really easily. I feel like the darkness effect should be nerfed a tad, it really does make you feel helpless but in my opinion a bit too much, short of placing torches everywhere you walk and giving away your location, it’s impossible to navigate. Once optifine comes out it may help a but with the dynamic lighting from holding a torch, but i don’t want to rely on that for it to be enjoyable y’know? The only other thing i feel like is a problem is how unbelievably determined the warden is to get you after it spots you, that may sound like “yeah thats the point” but i dont feel like you should be able to hear the warden still charging for you 300 blocks away, isn't he supposed to be blind? Thats all i can think of right now but all together the snapshot blew me away and i love it to bits! :)</p>",

It's easy to trap the warden and you can make it stuck in water.<br>I think the Warden should have more health than the Bedrock Wither. It should be at least 650 HP.<br>Currently, the Warden has the exact speed of that you can jump backwards and crit it but it barely reaches you.<br>I would make the Warden immune against fall damage, burning, freezing, drowning, withering, explosions and magic.</p>\n<p>Since it was said that the Warden is not intended to be killed but to be avoid, it encourages the players even more to kill it. My suggestion for that to actually add a reward for killing it but give it an aura based shield (like the Wither and charged Creeper overlay) that makes it invincible.<br>This shield can be broken with a special item that has to be crafted. The materials for that should be spread in the world, and one ingredient should be found in the Deep Dark, this ingredient can be found once per Deep Dark, so only one Warden per Deep Dark can have its shield broken. That special item has one use and the shield will only disappear for a short time.<br>Killing the warden will reward you with stuff that helps to craft your own aura shield that acts like a Super Mario invincibility star. You should not get an advancement for killing the Warden but enabling the shield.</p>",

Some iron armor or enchanted chainmail armor would be very nice too,</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The Warden is cheeseable, it's easy to pillar up or dig away, I would suggest for the warden to dig back on the ground and tunnel to reach the player, or do a sort of shockwave attack to push the player off of the pillar, or even just throw some sculk gathered on the ground at the player and give some effect, like poison or slowness, or a new effect that makes the player attracted to the warden,</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anyway, the snapshot is awesome and I can't wait to discover the rest of the wild update :)</p>",

I like that it can start chasing you if you make too much noise and eventually kill you, but I don't like how it stays in that state for a really long time even after you're a considerable distance away from it and remain silent. It feels like it's just seeing you at that point.</p>\n<p>- Solutions for anti-escape methods: You could make it climb pillars, or throw something at the player. If the player blocks off an entrance to a room, you could make the Warden emerge from the ground like it does when it spawns and play a sound that indicates it's cooling down that ability.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The darkness effect:</p>\n<p>- I don't like it just because it makes it impossible to see where you're going. I'm not against it since I really want to feel scared and threatened, but I feel like an effect like this doesn't really work in a huge open space like the ancient cities. That brings me to my issues with the cities themselves.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The cities:</p>\n<p>- They feel too open (I like how big they are though). You can fly in with an elytra, fly out, and never encounter the warden once since all the rooms are open. They feel too easy to traverse, and the high walls don't help with the warden pillaring issue.</p>",

Also the warden should have a lot more health than he has to be a real challenge, and immune to item spam. Everything else good job. </p>",

However, to balance out this change, I would suggest increasing the amount of shriekers needed to spawn the warden by a little bit. Other then that, you've already heard this a billion times but the general loot needs a buff. Maybe not end city level like many are suggesting, but maybe like bridge bastion level (more in the sense of loot rarity instead of the actual loot tables.</p>",

But after a while i noticed, he wasn't interested in me at all, he just went after the bats!&nbsp;He never left, so I was forced to piller upp and kill him with my bow. The fight was to easy... He should be able to climb.&nbsp;I decided to turn of mob spawning so I could have an uninterrupted experience.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For some reason after the first warden, only one Scrieker had to be activated to summon a new. When the came I easily beat them at a distance, even at ground level my punch bow kept him at a distance.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The loot was very disappointing, not worth the time it took to get it. I couldn't even find the new enchantment. Later I flew around in creative, looked in every chest and found noting. It needs to be at least one in every city, since they are so rare. The only thing worth something to me would be the skeleton skulls and the reinforced deepslate frame. But if you remove it's ability to be moved by pistons it will be worthless as well. Since then I cant use it to trap an wither in it so I can make a cobble farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To be fair this is a experimental snapshot, and it amazing, and have never been more scared in Minecraft.

I had to loot 2 cities to get enough books(one in creative because it took a long time to loot the 1st one and I only got 3 level 1 books). This is fair for single player worlds but would be too rare for servers. <br>Also, I know this is probably too early in development and this might get fixed but there seems to be a bug with the enchantment - when you are sprinting and then you press sneak, your speed is slightly faster than sneaking when walking (both cases while wearing Swift sneak 3, I didn't test for all 3 levels). So basically sneaking speed should be the same irrespective of when you activate it (while walking or sprinting). Also the Sculk sensor considers it to be sneaking (doesn't activate) in both the cases (which is intended, but one is faster than the other).</p>",

Now when it comes to the ancient cities, the only thing I would change is maybe the loot in the chests, since it feels like ancient cities and the warden are end game content, I feel like the loot in the chests should be beefed up just a bit, (with things like enchanted apples and other things). Overall I love the feel of both the warden and the ancient cities, (the wool integrated into the walls is also useful). 10/10 much spook </p>",

        "body": "<p>I have a variety of pros and cons to how the Deep Dark as a whole is implemented.<br><br>1. The Warden is without a doubt a stressful threat. Navigating an ancient city or cave and triggering a Shrieker on accident made me go into a panic a couple of times, because I knew a Warden was a second away from spawning. Every time this happened I found a hiding spot and used methods to distract it, either using Iron Golems to take its focus off of me or using a Thumper strategy, by using a redstone mechanism. It's more terrifying to see a Warden get flung by a pack of Golems. I understand an anti-cheesing mechanic is planned so I won't go into how easy it is to avoid it, but I will say the Darkness effect is just perfect.<br><br>2. The Deep Dark itself is the coolest concept of a Cave Biome, however restricting its existence to specific structures and around it is what kills its mystique for me. Every time you will see a growth of Sculk you know there's an Ancient City nearby, and it would be better to occasionally find splotches of Deep Dark in standard caves to keep the spice of spelunking up.<br><br>3. The loot in Ancient Cities is not worth it to risk going into the dangerous circumstances. Swift Sneak is a great enchantment but I would also like to find Diamonds, extremely rare enchantment books like Mending and Fortune, and other rarities to match the level of risk, especially since these structures are going to play a critical role in the Wild Update.</p>",

Maybe if it had some other new block to fill in between the sculck patches or if sculk was more abundant it would look better or some type of sculk hanging from the ceiling or floor built up like in the dripstone biomes. \n<br />I also think it needs to have some other unique mobs to fill it out. It seems very easy to get through without alerting the warden so another mob to fight would definitely make it scarier and make it more likely you trigger a sculk sensor. My final nit pick is the loot. The ancient cities need something much more unique than  the swift sneak enchant. It is really only useful in the deep dark. If you added something that was really good and can change the game a bit more like a new weapon jt would be more worth while. It just seems like it isnt very necessary to go there right now. These arent huge problems and it is early in bevelopement so I assume alot will change but these are just some things to consider.</p>",

Azalea wood could also be a part of the structures. loot in the cities are decent, especially with a new enchantment that brings a quality of life to the game, but there needs to be more. Of course the classic loot of diamonds, raw gold, raw Iron, raw copper, Redstone, and lapis, especially since the cities are deep under ground. And another unique item, something completely new, maybe an item titled: \"Conjured souls\" maybe it can be crafted with a Flint n steel to create a soul Flint and steel, potentially having a use for a future update ;). Perhaps a new mob as well, one that doesn't disturb or seem out of place of the mechanics of the deep dark, a creature weaker and less powerful than the warden but still something to avoid, \"The stalker\". A creature that wanders around but moves very slowly, at 200 health and its only attack is spraying something called sculk spores whichll turn players heart to sculk acting as a slower wither effect, causing players to also recieve blindness (not  darkness) and slowness. The sculk spores can also turn hostile mobs to sculk mobs. The stalker would be extremely slow compared to the warden and is easily avoidable, but it'll be the players mistake if they stop for awhile. Lastly, when they catch you they'll shriek alerting the warden. </p>",

I think in terms of cave generation, more lush generation rather than dripstone but with less shiekers farther from the city so that it's got the main aesthetic but not super op dangerous.</p>",

It wouldn't have to phase through a wall close to you everytime, but it could happen, and it would be a nice jumpscare element to see him pop up right next to you out of a wall e.g. But even seeing it phase through a wall in the distance in a corridor you're walking or just somewhere else in the distance would already be pretty scary/eery and put you on guard.</p>\n<p><em>(CONTINUOUS IN A FOLLOWING POST DUE TO CHARACTER LIMIT...)</em></p>",

I definitely would bring lots of wool, torches, and a hoe. Sneaking around, locating and destroying shriekers, then sensors, and then lighting and looting, seemed to be the best way I could go about it. My hand cramped from holding the shift key so hard, not wanting to set off any shriekers and summon the warden of course. The darkness effect is very appropriate, I love the kind of pulsating effect it has and I love panicking and not being able to see fully whilst running, or better, sneaking from the warden. I love the idea of the warden roaring and causing a vibration as a counter attack to pillaring upwards. It only makes sense that it uses vibrations to locate you, and that it can also use them to hurt you. Swift sneak is a great enchantment, I don’t think it should be a legging enchantment(like some suggested) I definitely agree that you shouldn’t be able to combine it with something like soul speed.  The ancient cities are amazing, although unintentional, I do like the look of some parts being submerged; obviously chest rooms and alters should not be, but the look of the halls adds to the ruined aspect. I do however, think that more unique loot is necessary to be a better incentive to risk possibly encountering the warden (maybe unique weapons or artifacts). A semi-related suggestion I have is using the goat horn to “stun” or confuse the warden. </p>",

It gives the playerbase a general idea about what the deep dark will be.</p>\n<p>The Warden is an interesting mob. It has really smooth overall graphic design and includes some great animations for it spawning in, as well as despawning. Its sheer height is jarring and adds onto the feeling of horror in which it invokes, as well as the way it is spawned through the ear-piercing sound of the Shrieker.</p>\n<p>It is a very challenging mob if fought legitimately, with the high health and damage it deals, however, can be cheesed very easily, either by pillaring or using lava. I feel to combat this problem, the Warden should be fire-proof and have a greater amount of health. The player could also be given weakness/mining fatigue if close to the Warden, giving people less of an incentive to be near the warden in any way.</p>\n<p>I also love how the darkness effect gives the entire area an actual atmosphere, which I heavily support within the game - I'd personally love for the deep dark to have an overall darkness effect (similar to void fog) when being inside the biome, as currently, the amount of light within the deep dark ruins the immersion IMO.</p>\n<p>One thing I would like to see within the Deep Dark would be a larger amount of Sculk within the caves, as the current patchy theme of the sculk is very underwhelming and not the greatest to look at. I'd love to see caves completely full of the blocks.</p>",

This is not currently the case on Java edition, but is essential for the intended use case of skulk blocks, which is AFK mob farms. Requiring player interaction to drop the xp totally defeats the purpose of turning the xp into skulk blocks in the first place, since if the player had to be breaking blocks they may as well just be hitting mobs. Given the only way to currently get xp without player interaction is with zombie piglins, and that is intended to be removed from the game at some point, this is an absolutely necessary change. I don't envision this having any balancing issues given I'm fairly certain this is already the case in Bedrock experimental, and the skulk blocks only containing xp orbs with 1 xp each already limits the speed of any xp farm utilizing skulk blocks since the player can only absorb 1 xp orb at a time.</p>",

But when it does find you being chased is like something out of a horror game, I think that's what the Warden does best. but personally the only things I didn't enjoy was how sometimes the Warden would get easily distracted by bats, or other mobs that are in its way like Zombies and Skeletons (Which shouldn't be spawning in the deep dark to begin with) I think the Warden's behavior should be tweaked a bit so that it ignores other mobs other than you.</p>\n<p>Sneaking around the Warden was very easy at times because like I have stated it gets distracted way too easily, that and it can get stuck in bodies of water and be completely immobile. I think that the warden should be able to easily move through bodies of water to get to you, because having a terrifying beast chase you and then get stuck just ruins the fear factor.</p>\n<p>Looting the End cities right now doesn't feel all that rewarding because most of the loot you get aside from enchanting books are really lackluster. I hope there are plans to add more unique loot to the ancient cities would give players more of a reason to go there other than just for harvesting sculk.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall, I think the Warden is pretty scary, but there should be some adjustments to make it as scary as it can possibly be.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I was able to loot chests, but I don't currently feel as if the loot is worth the danger -- I would go there in survival just for the experience of being scared, rather than any practical reward.&nbsp; My biggest problem is that the warden is easily defeated by pillaring up a few blocks. If it could break blocks only when it's at the peak of its possible anger, burrow through blocks while angry, climb, or shoot projectiles, this could be easily mitigated. Lava and deep water also completely invalidate it, since it can't swim.</p>",

However, it was not difficult to avoid the Warden, and the wool walkways made it ridiculously to keep safe from the Warden. As soon as I realized this, I was able to kill the Warden with just my sword (since I was on the walkway and it was not) and I could get in the Warden's face and swing at it with my sword. As for the amount of time it takes for the Warden to leave, it was too short. I was able to distract it, stay still for a bit, and the Warden left. Also the second Warden that was spawned in spawned in a 2 block high area and suffocated to death. Overall the Warden needs a much longer reach, it needs to stick around much longer, and it needs a better detection of where it can spawn. The scariness was quite effective and even after I knew how easy it was to kill the Warden, I was still scared by the Warden emerging.</p>",

Even when I don't stack up or dig into walls to avoid it, it's still easy to avoid by sneaking away when it's digging out of the ground. Drastically increasing its vibration detection and sniffing range could help out with this, as it currently feels like a localized threat that can't do much outside of where it spawned if you're able to get away. I often had to help the Warden get to me in order to experience it fully, and when I did, the experience was amazing. It's absolutely terrifying if you set rules for yourself to improve the experience</p>\n<p>Another major issue I noticed is with the Sculk Shrieker. If you break it before it finishes screaming, it won't increase the Warden's spawn tracker. I was able to parade about an entire ancient ancient city without summoning the Warden once, making tons of noise most of the time, just by breaking the shriekers before they finished screaming. Making the shrieker increase the spawn tracker at the start of the scream could be a good fix</p>\n<p>Lastly, the Deep Dark biome outside of the Ancient Cities feels extremely bare and uninteresting. Even just making sculk spawn in the roof could make it feel like a much richer. The Deep Dark also usually generates in very small patches, and is almost always surrounded by dripstone caves. I like that the Deep Dark needs high continentalness to spawn, but toning that down might help with some variety in and around the biome</p>",

The Warden cannot get out a one-block deep water pool, making it easy to kill.</p>\n<p>5. The Punch bow enchantment knocks back the Warden enough for the Warden to never be able to reach the player.</p>\n<p>6. The player can hide under a gap less than three blocks tall and easily kill the Warden.</p>\n<p>7. The player can pillar up and easily kill the Warden.</p>\n<p>8. The player can break a sculk shrieker before it finishes its shriek, stopping the Warden from spawning.</p>\n<p>Excluding these issues, the Warden is definitely a challenge. It being able to one-shot me through unenchanted netherite armor was definitely a surprise to be sure (since I did not expect such a large buff from its initial prototype footage), but a welcomed one. It was also a good choice to make the Warden be able to sniff the player out, making the player actively have to avoid the Warden.

There may be a way to get it working in a way that very closely matches the effect used without ray tracing though. I'd suggest using same distance based fog as the blindness effect normally uses with RTX (although the bug with distance fog only using the skybox colours instead of the defined colours would have to be fixed to implement this properly), and to mimic the behaviours of the darkness creeping upon the light levels of emissive blocks, the irradiance cache data could be temporarily flushed. This would result in the secondary bounce GI disappearing temporarily, which would make the distance that PBR emissive light travels become very small in that time period.</p>\n<p>Through RTX the Warden has the potential to be one of the most visually impressive encounters in any video game, and I would absolutely love to see these features implemented!</p>",

Similarly, one could bore down three blocks and cap off the top to be instantly out of any possible reach, then tunnel out of range of the sensors.&nbsp;<br>-Two block high passages are impassable to the Warden, allowing for easy barricading of its path to the player<br>-The scream and dig-out sequence gives you plenty of time to safely undertake noisy maneuvers, like the ones listed above as well as sprinting a healthy distance away, before the Warden actually starts responding to anything.<br>-Liquids render the Warden pretty helpless, especially lava<br>-The presence of a few mobs completely neutralizes the Warden. The constant noises just make it path around aimlessly as it starts investigating a new noise before it gets to the last one. It ends up actually attacking anything only about once a minute at best. Meanwhile you can run, place blocks, do pretty much whatever. As long as you keep moving and don't walk right into it, the Warden won't even notice you. (Continued)</p>",

A lava bucket, a tower of 4 blocks or hiding in the walls. I think that the difficulty of the Warden could be improved in a technical pov, what I mean by that is that it could have more ways to attack the players than just hitting him? So, it's a fun and really scary encounter, easy to understand the situation (to be silent ...) but it's somewhat easy.</p>\n\n<p>&gt; I think that it needs to be A FLYING ENNEMY! It would avoid players to tower and make things more spooky and challenging ! Finally, a little and annoying ennemy, like a silverfish but Warden like?\n<br />Because one of the weakness of the Warden is being too big.\n<br />To make it shorter, I think it's great for a first snapshot but it needs to have higher stakes, to be more challenging, more interesting.

I have to say that for the purposes of testing I played from a Creative setup, not true survival where I'd go through the arduous process of collecting precious resources that I'd fear losing. Therefore the whole experience would probably be much more unnerving than it was. I was a bit nervous, but felt rather safe with the arsenal of responses at my disposal. Being able to easily whack the Warden to death without fear of retaliation takes a lot out of the fear factor. To be honest, as it stands right now, I'm more scared of creeper surprises near lava. I can see how the Warden would be terrifying to a new uninformed player who casually struts into the Deep Dark, but otherwise it doesn't do much. With the DD being mob-free and the Warden dynamics being very specific, the whole experience is far too predictable. Only summoned by specific player actions, only via a specific chain of blocks, takes a specific amount of time to show up, only detects specific things (noise), and can be avoided or defeated virtually risk-free using very simple strats.</p>\n<p>A huge amount of the fear factor in Minecraft survival comes from unpredictability. You might be able to sprint around at night on flat terrain without much fear, while digging straight down into a cavern full of monsters can result in needing a change of underpants. Same with creeper surprises on high ledges or near lava, or realizing that a ghast has come to admire your nether parkour skills. (Continued)</p>",

The core philosophy behind the DD seems to intentionally steer completely away from that. This is really nice in its own way because it provides a very novel kind of experience to Minecraft. However, it also means that it has to go the extra mile to reinstate that fear. The dynamic nature of Minecraft that normally poses threats to the player instead becomes their most powerful weapon in the DD. To address this, some changes definitely need to be made to how the Warden operates. I'm no game designer, but these are some things that I think should be strongly considered:</p>\n<p>-Attack radius. I believe it is an ABSOLUTE must for what the Warden is meant to be that it can return melee attacks from any distance and angle that a player can hit it. When you can turn the Warden into a big cow with lots of HP by placing three blocks or digging up two, there is no survival horror. I think it would be really cool if the Warden could do an overhead arm swipe attack (even better with high knockback) to deal with towerers, for example.</p>\n<p>-Fluids handling. Should be able to swim or something similar, maybe immune to fire/lava too</p>\n<p>-Not getting paralyzed by multiple mobs. Either prioritize player sounds or deal with things one at a time</p>\n<p>-Summoning sequence is long, lots of time to react</p>\n<p>-Some sort of abilities to hunt down players that are towering/tunneling are a must</p>",

Also even with the head space the warden is not able to break doors of any kind.

Not in damage nor in its HP, but being able to tower up 2 blocks and hit it till it's dead was kinda lame. Maybe give it a ranged attack to knock you off buildings, or (my personal fav) make it able to break blocks. It would be fair since it mosly only spawns when a player is near, and will also go back into the ground after some time, making the damage only minimal. And he should only be able to break blocks when he's fully aware of you (when he does that animation where he leans foreward).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Regarding the ancient cities:</p>\n<p>I personally think the loot was too underwhelming. Since the warden is probably one of the most dangerous mobs in the game, it should be high reward to even get near it. I alse think that the ancient cities should work like bastions, having more variants. Because so far i've seen, the cities were all kinda the same.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>So my final conclusion: buff the warden with a new abilty to counter cheesing it, and buff the ancient city loot and make more variants.</p>\n<p>(sorry for my bad english apriciate it if you red all this, enjoy your day :D)</p>",

I like the new enchantment and it's awesome you can find skeleton skulls here. there needs to be at least one more exclusive item here though.</p>\n<p>3. was the warden scary? at first, yes. when I first summoned it I was scared. the darkness effect is great and made it even spookier. It was fun to run through the corridors and escape the warden, but once I used the block stacking trick the fear kind of went away. Please make the warden able to climb blocks, be fire resistant, and have a way to get people who are hiding in small holes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4. I will say, actually sneaking around the warden is quite difficult. when you are not running away or just using simple tricks on it, just sneaking around it is terrifying! also, give the warden more health. and also, he should be able to call out to other wardens if he is having trouble finding you, but he knows you are there.</p>\n<p>5. The ancient cities are great, and I like how it is designed. I do think that there should be more types of rooms and areas, maybe some indoor areas. like, it would be cool if there was a prison area kind of like in the strongholds. anyway, there are a lot of changes to be made, so keep going!&nbsp;</p>",

Getting away from the Warden is both easy and non-easy, if the warden is within close range, it is difficult, and that's cool, but if its 15-20 blocks away, it'll be very easy to build up or dig down to avoid it. The way to get loot in how I got it, is to get a stack or two of wool, then build up against the walls, then bridge to the chests to grab the loot. The darkness effect is a bit annoying sometimes, but its great for the immersion. The Warden was very intimidating when walking/running towards you, even on creative and something behind me, I still thought it was going towards me, and it's scary when its running towards you, its a great aspect of the warden.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overall, its a fun snapshot to test with. I would think it would be nice to give it the ability to destroy 1-2 blocks to get to the player (only if its on the highest heartbeat/anger level with a 5-10 second cooldown) so its less easy to cheese, but not impossible to get away from.</li>\n</ul>",

Challenging, totally, when he is summoned next to me, its very cool. But sometimes he's summoned far enough so he doesn't hear me. It's like... He doesnt seems that omnipresent creature. Just a dumb big boy.</li>\n<li>When the warden was actually summoned, most of the times he seems unpredictable. I was scared at first, but then realise that he's not that good at smelling my location out. If i just get quiet sometime somewhere, it's done. Only the first encounter, next to the big corridor in the city was really something scary and fun. Enjoyable sometimes. Then, just boring. Seems pointless, i think.</li>\n<li>My friends, that are definitely not as much experienced in the game as me, didn't know at first. I needed to tell them how to play in the deep dark, and only then the things worked.</li>\n<li>Yes. Like, the only times i were killed is when i go crazy recklessly like a dumb electric chicken. There's not enough shriekers in any of the cities i've come across. You cant be killed by a sleeping big boy, dude.</li>\n<li>Darkness feels soooo dark. I barely can see. I expected to see more lights in the horizon, even when everyghing goes dark, but no real problems. Its feels amazingly scary! 10/10</li>\n<li>The first time, me and my friends were terrified. Then, we just get used to it. Not a reeeal threat, you know? Just a thing that can catch you if you act like an possessed cat. Stay quiet, and its okay. Not scary.</li>\n</ul>",

Also, given that multiple wardens can be summoned, this furthers my point, that the only reason someone would go to the deep dark is for initial interest, or just the knowledge that they have killed a warden e.t.c., and</p>\n<p>3: New potions such as some kind of potion of distracting scent, maybe crafted using mud or something, that throws the warden off, and means it can't smell you.</p>",

The shell could be used to make armor, or maybe to \"see\" the vibrations being made, or maybe it would just drop a nautilus shell and slime.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the city needs a little more variety of loot in the chests - the new enchantment is great, but after you find that and maybe a couple other enchantments, there's little reason to keep exploring. Perhaps a chest in the middle of the city with extra valuable loot, but it surrounded by shriekers.</p>\n\n<p>The Warden is definitely interesting, but the attacks just seem basic. Most mobs just do damage by hitting you, so it's a bit of a shame that this is the only way the Warden does damage. It would be cool if it used sound to maybe freeze or slow you, on top of giving the darkness effect. And if it could grab you, and damage you while holding you, or even throw you up in the air so you fall and take fall damage, that would be awesome.</p>\n\n<p>The deep dark city looks spectacular. Because of this, other structures from old versions look outdated and a little ugly. Namely the stronghold and the woodland mansion. A redesign of these structures at some point would be very welcome.</p>\n\n<p>The caves and cliffs update was absolutely amazing, but now the caves seem barren with how big they are. I feel like more small structures like underwater ruins but underground would help fill the space nicely. Thank you!</p>",

I've been thinking, and there's some questions about the difficult of the deep dark and the cities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The detection range doesn't match. Many times the warden's summoned, he can't really detect you. Neither do the sensors.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Too much wool. It's really good to have it, but, in the actual game, there's not that much shriekers and sensors, so, the wool just adds an extra layer of protection to something that doest really need.</li>\n<li>Not much shriekers. If we have that much wool, and that detection range, then, we need more shriekers. Otherwise, it's an overkill of protection.</li>\n<li>The warden doesn't seems like a killing machine, when we put other mobs in the biome. &nbsp;I expected it to be really agressive, kill every zombie in the way, but, it's a slooow train, that eventually crashes with the poor zombie.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conclusion: In my eyes, its necessary to do 1 of those options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Increse the number of sensors and shriekers in the deep dark and ancient city.</li>\n<li>Decrease the amount of wool in the cities. (But that only solves the city)</li>\n<li>Increase the range of the warden and sensors. (But that doesn't seems like an ideal solution)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Have a nice day! Now i'm gonna stop posting in this thread, until the next experimental snapshot.</p>",

        "body": "<p>The update looks great! The first thing I did was go into the deep dark, give myself some gear, and test out an encounter with the Warden. I believe it is challenging to fight, but it can easily be avoided just by building a few blocks into the air. I think the amount of damage it did was good, giving players a reason not to fight the Warden in melee combat. The encounters I've had have felt enjoyable, and frightening almost. The way the Warden tries to seek out the player gives the game a strategic feel, and I found that really enjoyable. I found a way to sneak away from the Warden, and it is by using snowballs and slowly crouching away. I also found out that it is much more beneficial to just avoid the Warden entirely rather than trying to kill it. I was able to loot chests in the Ancient Cities just by checking the surroundings to see if the Warden could be summoned by the noises. The darkness effect felt eerie, but really cool at the same time. I liked how it implements fear into the player, and forces them to focus so they can escape the Warden safely. I also enjoy how it makes hearing a crucial part to survival, as when you can't see much, you have to use your ears to know where the Warden is. In my first interaction with the Warden, I felt pretty scared, and was immediately filled with adrenaline. However, after I escaped the Warden's grasp, I reflected on how cool the interaction was. Overall, this snapshot was amazing, and I really enjoyed playing on it.</p>",

After being confronted with the Warden I noticed that I can easily out run it or just pillar up, wich really took the scaryness. I also found that the Warden is often distracted by chasing bats wich allows me to make as much noise as I want and any body of water even a 1x1x1 hole with water can stop it. The Warden also has a very unbalanced x-ray like ability after it starts to chase the player. It follows me everywhere even when I don't make any sounds and it cannot even reach me it somehow knows where I am. Looting chests is kind of a callange even after distracting it with a snowball it will sitll come to you and make a pressure for looting chests in time. The darkness effect was more annoying than atmosheric and felt just like the blindness effect.</p>",

In other places like where the arches are that lead up to the reinforced deepslate, I ran out of blocks and snowballs, which made it next to impossible to shake the warden. Once the warden spawned in, I couldn't actively sneak and hide from it. It could always seem to find me. It took a long time for it to de-spawn too as mobs would often keep it's hearing activated and it would continuously smell me out in my little blocked off hole in the ground.&nbsp;<br>The loot chests were really easy to access for the most part. I could break a shrieker with ease to access them, though occasionally bats or other mobs would guard the chests which would make them harder to get to as they set off the sensors. I know y'all will be changing the loot later, but from what loot was there I thought there were too many bones.&nbsp;<br>The darkness effect was really scary! It almost felt too dark as I could barely see where I could jump next to escape. I was thankful for nearby candles! With what little light I had, I really had to think about where I could move next that the warden couldn't reach.<br>Also, I think there could be more sculk overall in the deep dark. The patches feel kind of small and easy to avoid.<br>Overall I was terrified just to the right amount! I absolutely loved the challenge and look forward to what else y'all will do with the warden!</p>",

        "body": "<p>A lot of others have already described how to cheese the Warden by blocking up, and I agree that it's too easy to kill. One idea (I saw in a YouTube video) that I liked a lot is that the Warden could dig down into the ground and despawn when it reaches low health. That way the player never kills the Warden but is rewarded somewhat by holding it off. Alternatively, attacking the Warden could summon more Wardens (maybe a Warden battle scream?), which would make attacking one a <em>very</em> bad idea. This wouldn't completely resolve the cheese-ability though; you could still stand atop a pillar and fight a bunch of Wardens simultaneously (e.g., with a bow and a few lava buckets).</p>\n<p>The sounds and darkness effect in the deep dark are fantastic! Very, very creepy. Definitely the most scared I've ever felt in Minecraft!</p>\n<p>I'm not sure how rare the ancient cities are, but the nearest one to me was over 2000 blocks away, which is on par with a Stronghold. I think it would be amazing of Cartographer villagers had a chance to sell a map that located an ancient city, or introduce a mechanic that provides some way to find these without exploring millions (2000*2000*50 = 200 million) of blocks.</p>",

However, by my second encounter I learned I could just pillar up a few blocks and be completely safe. During my third encounter with the Warden, it spawned on top of a pillar in the ancient city and was stuck on there for about a minute until I knocked it off the pillar.</p>\n\n<p>The ability to easily sneak around the Warden depended on where I was, areas with more sculk sensors gave me a harder time but it was mostly pretty easy to avoid the Warden. I learned I was able to get a lot of distance quickly as it spawned and the Warden became a borderline non-issue. Because of this it was incredibly easy to loot chests and just quickly run to a new area.</p>\n\n<p>The darkness effect is great. That, paired with the sounds of the Warden’s heartbeat and groans was terrifying. Even when I learned how easy it is to avoid the Warden, hearing it near me in the dark is horrifying. I just wish the effect would last longer, as it wore off soon into my encounters with the Warden. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, the Warden is scary, but not challenging. I hope that changes will be made to help the Warden overcome pillars and the walls of the ancient cities. Perhaps it could climb the walls, or jump higher, but changes should be made.</p>",

However, there were some things that I think need to be addressed:<br><br>1.) Aside from things like pillaring, digging, lava, and water, it is easy to cheese the warden by just dropping an item onto a sculk sensor. It sends a constant signal to the warden and you can just walk around with no fear.<br><br>2.) The darkness effect is a bit too dark. It makes it hard to get away from the warden because you can't see what you are doing. I would place torches, but that would just alert the warden. I would place wool to occlude the torch placing, but I can't see if I am placing it on sculk blocks. I know this tension is something that you want to achieve. But it is unfair and frustrating if you can't see anything at all. So I think the darkness should be a tad brighter.<br><br>3.) This might be a bit of a weird one, but the footstep sounds are too loud. The footsteps clash with the deep thumps of the warden's heartbeat and the soft warble of the antenna detecting vibrations, which is what you should be paying attention to. Being with a warden is tense, and the loud, higher-pitched footsteps take away from that tension. Maybe they could be lower pitched like the iron golem's footsteps or just less loud.<br><br>4.) More sensors! I found that I could walk around without much care. More sensors in the cities would up the tension if almost each step was accompanied by the clicks of a sensor.</p>",

Based on my tests, the sculk sensors only occasionally detect the shrieker being destroyed. (However it may be fixed in the future.)<br><br>I would still recommend finding a way for the Warden to continue pursuing you and somehow be able to increase the speed for the Warden by a little bit. The player can still outrun it if given enough obstacles and blocks to do so. As for players who would go underground, block themselves in, or put them inside one block tall holes, it would also be nice to see a new mechanic or small trick for the Warden to chase you. After playing it for a while, the Warden doesn't seem all too scary when you give the player the ability to react and easily counter the Warden and continue to explore the deep dark, or ancient city.</p>",

Similar to the skulk spreading the particles will travel from block to block out from the warden and hit the player similar to the dragons breath. It will also give you poison, nausea, and slowness, but the warden will only activate this ability when the player is not moving and the warden can't get to them. I is a good choice because no matter if the person builds up or digs into a wall the attack can reach them. The combination of potion effects will make the player want to get away, but it will be difficult to stay coordinated. I also think it makes&nbsp; sense as the warden is part of the skulk, so it acting as a skulk catalyst for an attack makes sense. I would also make the warden seem like a combination of all three blocks; the sensor is its ear things, it can give the darkness effect like the screamer, and it could spread the skulk like the catalyst. I think it would be a good counter to the normal cheesing methods.</p>",

I am still hopeful of future developments to avoid cheesing the Warden.</p>\n<p>2. Trying to run away from the Warden is intense because it is so fast and you have no time to eat food if it is tailing you. It makes a very good atmosphere of blindly running through dark caves hoping you encounter a good nook or cavern where you can stop the Warden in its tracks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3. Make the Warden deflect projectiles.</p>\n<p>4. Make the Warden immune to lava, fire and blast damage.</p>\n<p>5. Doing test fights against the Warden was fun; but fighting it in survival is nonetheless very difficult</p>\n<p>6. Yes, it is possible to sneak around the Warden as long as it is not aggressive yet.</p>\n<p>7. Yes, I was able to loot chests without being killed. The abundant naturally-generating wool makes for some good bridges and removing shriekers is a fair strategy</p>\n<p>8. The Darkness effect is alright as it is right now. It creates a feeling of helplessness in the presence of the Warden. With enough distance, it also makes the Warden just out of sight but within earshot which adds suspense to the encounter</p>\n<p>9. Encounters with the Warden are intense. With all the ambience, the Darkness effect and sound-effects all put together. .</p>",

Please keep this unintended feature! If players are smart, creative, and determined, they could piston these witherproof blocks to the surface, which could be used in piston doors, flex decorations, and most importantly a means of containing the wither! You may say the wither part is not good, but if you don't keep this feature then we'll just continue to cheese it in bedrock patches, which is less effort and is a reward with no challenge. </p>\n\n<p>For the deep dark biome/skulk patches itself.. Its cool but i feel its lacking in variety to feel like an actual biome. If perhaps some skulk vines could hang from nearby ceilings. Its purpose is to slightly counter sneaking(like the warden sniff). These vines will hang low, and if any mob passes through, it'll slightly illuminate and signal to the other skulk blocks of your presence. (Some extra skulk dwellers would spice it up too)</p>\n\n<p>Lastly i found the warden too easy to cheese, but i have a couple ideas to fix that. First: a special wall climbing animation to counter players that pillar. Second: a special ground slam if falling from heights. Third: dig through walls via animation for those that block themselves in a hole. Fourth: a large leap for those that retreat to higher ground. Cement fear into cheesers :)\n</p>",

        "body": "<p class=\"p1\">The Warden can be quite challenging, but I did find a bug where it got really focused on killing a bat, and walked into a corner (and the bat was gone), and it was still just standing there and not even trying to attack me (I was in survival mode). After about a minute, it all of the sudden got aggressive toward me after a few tries of making noise to lure it to me. I do really love the digging mechanic, where after a minute it will despawn, but I feel that to make the warden more challenging and to prevent cheesing (making the fight unfairly easy), the warden should be able to \"dig\" toward the player, similar to silverfish. I also had a hard time to place torches, and combined with the darkness effect, it made it a bit annoying. I do love the Warden and the way it is implemented though, those are just my few criticisms.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Also, a suggestion: I know the purpose of the Warden is to avoid it, but I think that having a bit of an incentive to go defeat the warden as an optional challenge would be cool. A concept I thought of is that the Warden, when first killed, drops \"the warden's heart,\" and, like the dragon egg, there can only be one naturally obtained in a world. This way players wouldn't try to farm the warden, and after that first time, there would be no reason to summon it. The heart would act like a trophy and a placeable block, with maybe a slight benefit like a beacon effect. It could have cool particles around it, and it will occasionally make warden whines.</p>",

However with the amount of wool around it was incredibly easy to rn back to the structure and run off away from it to safety before it even has a chance to spawn </p>\n\n<p>2 The heart beat sound was probably a be of the things that makes it more intense. However I feel like darkness could be stronger and I feel like the whole place should be lit exclusively by candles or lower levels of light source, maybe that means any light splurge placed in that biome gets a debuff in brightness almost like that biome swallows up light and I think it would be fitting since it is called the deep dark</p>\n\n<p>3 Again as mentioned before avoiding the warden was quite easy, I did test going toe to toe with it using snowballs and trying to get around it and it’s not super hard but it is intense maybe his sniffing mechanic should be more frequent? I’m not sure but I wouldn’t mind it be much harder.</p>\n\n<p>4 I was able to loot chests especially since some didn’t have a shirker nearby so I didn’t have to worry about being sneaky I did like the chest loot though, that new enchantment felt a little too infrequent but that’s probably intentional.</p>\n\n<p>5 I touched on this earlier and I feel like it could be better it looks great but it’s still pretty bright around light and the space around the player that they can see is a bit to much I think. Again I would love for the deep dark to passively make it have a moody brightness</p>\n\n<p>6 Warden made my heart pound</p>",

In my opinion, i expected more when MC Live said it became a bigger thing than what it was expected to be. it looks like there was more focus on the movement and the way the mob worked than what its going to drop, or an actual good reason to go down and explore these cities. in order to get me to actually explore these, the mob needs a unique drop or i want the ability to collect reinforced deep slate. i tend to be impressed with what the DEVS come up with but this, not so much this one, and i get that this isn't an official snapshot but even with caves in cliffs it felt like there was more focus and attention on it than this. i think there is still more work to be done in order to get me to find a reason to explore them.</p>",

Here are some things i suggest:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>make the warden be able to deflect arrows similar to how endermen do.</li>\n<li>make it so that the warden can break blocks to get to the player if they are hiding in a hole similar to the wither.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are some ways i believe can make the warden less killable. But other than that i love the sounds and darkness effect of the warden. it wakes it feel quite spooky!</p>\n<p>Another thing although i love the ancient city's and the vibe of them...there isn't much of a reason to explore it... Sure the new enchantment is ok however i do find that the restrictions for it are a little too harsh. Perhaps removing some restrictions or making it a leggings enchantment will make it worth searching for. Also in my personal opinion the loot table for the chests are a bit disappointing. Perhaps adding a new tool item can make it a bit more exploration worth it. So far i like the vibe but it needs more polish.&nbsp;</p>",

There isn't much use other than for the deep dark, its a catch 22. another thing is that I believe that the warden is too easy as a mini-boss, and should be treated like one (for example the wither dropping good loot, while the warden drops nothing). It would be amazing to see more lore of the warden, and maybe even have a specific drop for the warden, maybe implementing a system where the ancient relics from the archeology stuff (which I know has been canceled) is being protected by the warden, and only the warden has the key to open up the \"vault\" that the loot is hiding behind.

Just trying to get away while you can't see 3 blocks in front of you is really intense.</p>\n<p>The loot is a little too easy to get to. Just find all the Sculk Shriekers and break them, and then there is no threat. Honestly I like this, but if they want to change it so that Sculk Shriekers are unbreakable, I understand. But then I can't keep a Warden glass in my base :(</p>\n<p>Also, the loot is honestly underwhelming. I hope when they said there is something worth it down in the Deep Dark they didn't mean Swift Sneak. I think its a cool addition but I feel one other unique and really useful item would be good. Maybe add some ores and food to chests as well.</p>\n<p>The Darkness effect feels amazing. It's pulsating and makes me super nervous, and increases the tension.

It has a lot of life,&nbsp; hits really hard, but doesn't do anything. It's very easy to go around it without him attacking, you get on a pillar, you lure it away with snowballs. At no time when I was facing the warde did I feel in danger. Moreover, the strategy of making a snowman to distract it totally breaks the fight because it will constantly try to catch the snowman without ever turning on the player, even when getting hit. Put the snowman in a safe place, so that it never dies, and you've won. With \"classic\" survival gear (partially enchanted diamond armor, enchanted sword and bow + arrow stack) I never had any problems beating it. Sure, as soon as you beat one, another one appears, resetting the threat. But they are so easy to escape that I was able to get away without any problem. Why not have several appear in the same place? As for the chests, it's not too difficult to loot them, knowing that there are no other monsters than the warden. The Darkness effect is effective, but for it to be more terrifying, the warden should try to surprise us. There, it runs on us and I was never surprised by an apparition that I had not seen because of the effect.</p>\n<p>So, apart from the warden fight, a bit too easy, the snapshot is great, keep it up!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>To start I love how the skulk and ancient cities feel so mysterious and interesting compared to other overworld biomes and structures! The shriekers do an amazing job building atmosphere and suspense to the wardens arrival. When the warden was inevitably summoned it would get pretty tense with all the visual and auditory effects! I did find the warden pretty easy to escape the by just towering and waiting out the timer or running away as soon as it is summoned. Also sometimes a bat will just distract the warden for a few minutes (albeit pretty hilarious still an issue). Though I do have some ideas on how to counter these issues. I think the warden should become immediately enraged if it hears sprinting (possibly hardmode exclusive) making a getaway strategy a necessity.  All bats within a 40 block radius of the warden should perch on the nearest ceiling and not react to players or mobs. Lastly to counter towering up, digging a hole or boxing I think that the warden should have a screech attack of 5-15 block range that goes through thin walls (if this gets added the wardens hit box might be able to be adjusted to better reflect his size since he wouldn’t have to always be within melee range). If these ways to avoid the warden completely are patched, I think the warden would honestly be feature complete! Thanks to all those who read all this and I am going to make a separate comment regarding the loot in the deep dark and ancient cities. </p>",

I did find out that you can prevent the spawning of a warden if you break the shrieker that is calling to the warden, whether this is a bug or not I'm unsure about. Was also playing with the spawn mechanics of the Warden and it can apparently spawn on any block, including barriers (is quite silly seeing the warden climbing through the air). The deep dark could use some more loot. While the sculk blocks are nice, the deep dark is covered in them. While a new enchantment is nice, I'm not sure people will risk hardcore worlds just for the ability to move faster while sneaking. Maybe adding some loot similar to the bastions would make the experience more rewarding. I'm guessing the Warden isn't fully finished, so I'm curious to see how it prevents players from towering up. Will it climb up walls like spiders, or throw a projectile? Also you can cheese it with a lava bucket apparently, just saying. The Warden itself is perhaps one of the most well done mobs I've ever seen. I wish more mobs were animated like that, it would make the Minecraft world seem so much more alive.</p>\n<p>And yes... it is creepy and hard to avoid.</p>\n<p>About that frame in the center of the city, some speculate it's a new portal. I hope it is, because why would you make it unbreakable? The only other blocks like that are Bedrock and the End Portal Frame. If there is a new dimension, I expect it'll be released after 1.19 (which would be fitting as the next one is 1.20)</p>",

Perhaps a way for the warden to realize this and crawl through the hole or something after you could fix this? My next encounter with him building 3 blocks up completely prevented him from even touching me meaning it was just a minute of waiting before I could continue exploring. Later on I decided to not use blocks and have a more genuine warden experience. Eventually after messing with him enough he started chasing me but alas he was very easy to outrun by just running down the wool paths in the ancient city, plucking bow shots on occasion at him. I would love it if the warden had some sort of counter to make all three of these experiences more scary / difficult. Again I absolutely loved this snapshot despite that and am very excited for 1.19, keep up the good work Mojang!</p>",

        "body": "<p>Love the idea, and the spawning mechanic seems really nice, although as others are saying it's too easy to get around. If you pillar at all, it just isn't a threat. While this isn't inherently bad, if it's meant to be something you have to avoid by sneaking, it should have a different attack, or a new environmental hazard should be created so that you cant just go above things. For example, maybe a new type of flying shulker enemy to knock you off pillars, or the warden itself could break blocks/ pull you down/ hit you with something to knock you off.&nbsp;<br><br>Regardless, despite this, I think it's a really cool edition that helps the biome feel more complete. Likewise with the darkness effect.&nbsp;<br><br>(Sidenote though, please make the structure in the forgotten city a portal, that would be a great edition in my opinion-)&nbsp;</p>",

The deep dark outside of the cities feels pretty sparse to me--especially with the patchy way that the sculk generates. I might feel better about it if the sculk covered more of the actual cave or looked more like it was growing rampantly in veins; really dominating the place. It's especially underwhelming where it generates above deepslate. I think just a greater covering of sculk, more tendrils/sculk-based structures, or just limiting it to only generating below y=0 would bring out the potential in a biome i am by all means extremely excited for. All of the textures are on point, the concept is amazing--I just want to really be surrounded by it!</p>",

During my Ancient City survival raid, I managed to loot every chest except for two. That was only because I couldn't find them until I checked out the structure in creative. I think darkness effect was well done but, in my opinion, you can see too much of the Warden when it happens, though. I'd prefer it if the Warden was shrouded in darkness and harder to see except for the glowing pixels on its face and chest. I always felt nervous when the Warden emerged, but I'd always end up amused after constructing a pillar and watching it wander around. I'd even drop items down and watch it waddle over to them for my own amusement.</p>",

Having an elytra and rockets makes for an easy getaway.</p>\n<p>Encountering the warden was spooky! I didn't know when it would happen so I was anxious the entire time I was in the ancient city.

This made everything about 3 times as difficult as it would have been.</p>\n<p>The warden didn't scare me as much as it made my heart race. Its heartbeat might have also added to that sensation.

Maybe moving the smithing table to be exclusive to Ancient Cities or even a special furnace to smelt the netherite bars, either way I believe it would greatly benefit and add quite a bit of challenge to the experience.</p>\n\n<p>A little bonus too is that the name-sake would work too, because you would need Ancient Cities to smelt/use Ancient Debris and the overall dark-gray color of netherite works with the grayish colors of the structure as well.</p>",

Anyways, I wanted to write this to pitch a few ideas that would make the Warden more of a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n<p>First, I think the Warden's sensor range should be increased. It should detect anything within the general area of Ancient Cities (100+ blocks), since nothing but the player is meant to make vibrations down there.</p>\n<p>Second, it is easy to outrun the Warden so I think it should continually get faster as it runs until it matches the speed of the player. It should also chase the player until it gets them or becomes stuck.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I think that when the Warden realizes it can't get you from where it is, it will crawl into the ground and emerge wherever the player is standing. If the player standing on a one-block-wide pillar, and the Warden is angry it would literally emerge from right under the player if there isn't any other suitable space.</p>",

I think that the warden should be invincible to suffocation damage, since the warden spawning and despawning animation suggests that it lives for long periods of time in solid blocks. Therefore it makes sense that it would have developed some sort of way of surviving those conditions. Also, as many people have pointed out, it seems too easy to \"cheese\" it by pillaring up or trapping it in lava.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Otherwise, my experience with the warden was very enjoyable. I really liked the amount of health, damage and speed the warden has, and I do not think that it should be nerfed in any way. The new sneaking aspect in gameplay is very appealing to me, and I really like the sound design once the warden is summoned. The warden is terrifying, and I really like it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Ancient cities:</p>\n<p>I really like the design and layout of the ancient cities. The block pallet is perfect, and the structure feels very natural/immersive. I like the unique loot that can be found in the chests, and am exited to see a new way of obtaining skulls. The new reinforced deepslate is fascinating, and I am very exited to see its application in the technical aspects of the game. I really hope it will be more easily obtainable in survival.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Darkness effect:</p>\n<p>This effect can get quite annoying at times, but that really is its purpose. I do think that night vision should counter its effects in some way, and maybe be an item in loot chests.</p>",

It could be similar to vines, growing on the roof of caves and reaching all the way down to the ground, but it would have some special interaction with other Sculk mechanics.</p>\n<p>Any flying entities caught in these Sculk \"vines\" would get tangled up in the plant's(?) leaves and slowly fall to the ground. It makes a lot of noise when mobs pass through it too, so it acts as a hazard.</p>\n<p>Not only would this solve the elytra problem, as enough of these \"vines\" in an area would make travel through the air impossible, but it would also give the area a lot of ambience and extra mood; whilst giving the ceiling of the deep dark caves some visual interest. Additionally, the Warden may be able to climb up these vines, finally allowing it to deal with its mortal enemy; the common bat.</p>\n<p>This would not only give the Warden some more presence and force players to actually engage with it, but it would also give player the opportunity to lob projectiles at the \"vines\" to lure the Warden to specific areas.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is just a solution thought up by some random player of the game, who has no idea if this idea can be implemented or not. But hopefully the idea of some anti-elytra cheese is helpful to you.</p>",

Mabey the warden hearing things should take precedent over smelling the player?</li>\n<li>Sneaking around the ancient city, and the spawned wardens was fun.

However, in its current state, it definitely has some drawbacks- as soon as you get it stuck in a hole or you tower above it, it can’t do anything to you, making it very easy to just cheese the fight at no real cost. The obvious solutions all have their drawbacks; allowing it to break blocks, etc- but a different approach could be utilising the burrowing animations that have already been created to actually allow the warden to burrow underground and pop back up again near the player in the event it cannot reach the player, but it would probably come at the cost of the animations looking odd in the event it has to enter a small space or otherwise. I have already personally encountered some interactions with the warden’s AI and the animations that seem a bit out of place, like it’s ability to burrow up or down through a floating block in the air rather than a suitable area of the ground. I’ve also noticed some quirks with which sometimes it will seem to get stuck and refuse to interact or recognise the player at all, appearing to stick to blocks and not be able to move or otherwise just suddenly running off or not being able to path-find to the player for whatever reason. Overall, it does a perfect job of achieving the desire to avoid it aspect, but the ability to cheese it at the moment is definitely a concern.</p>",

The Warden is a boss mob and I dont think something that powerful should have more then one in a Deep Dark Biome? Or at least a invisible timer before another one can spawn if you kill the first one. Them just spawning immediately after the first one dies if you happen to make a mistake, or having multiple can spawn at a time just seems kinda lame? I know your not <strong>meant</strong> to kill them but becuase of how hard it is to do so, you should be rewarded SOMEWHAT if you manage to do so. If not loot, then immunity to explore the city even if its for a short period of time.&nbsp;<br><br>Also idk if they scrapped them completely but I kinda miss the teaser structures way back when the Warden was first announced with the small poke holes in caves with little rooms. I def love the city but I hope these will still be included in smaller pockets around the world.<br><br>These are mostly nitpicks but;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I dont really like the name Ancient City becuase well, its not really a city? More of a Ancient Catacombs or Ancient Temple to be honest.</li>\n<li>I still do think the Warden should have a Boss Bar, its def a boss.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>I know they said its not gonna have loot but I still think that's not a good decision tbh. Even Elder guardians drop sponge and scales! And they're only really there to make the Ocean Temples harder.</li>\n</ul>",

The Warden is terrifying. \n<br />The first ancient city I went too was half submerged in water and (like everyone else has said) it's too easy to get away from /kill the Warden. Seeing as how he seems to already phase through blocks when emerging, it would be cool to see him phase through walls or up the pillar I build. Phasing would of course slow him down a little and there would be particles based on the blocks he is phasing through (like when he emerges from the ground). Perhaps instead of just phasing he could crawl into the ground/ dig into a wall which would allow him to re-emerge through any other connected block? Like if I build a pillar up, he can dig into the ground (or the bottom of my pillar) and re-emerge at the top of my pillar.</p>\n\n<p>I think he also need to be able to move through water and lava quickly to prevent using water or lava streams to keep him in one place.</p>\n\n<p>Also adding fire/blast protection to the warden would help prevent players from overusing explosives.</p>\n\n<p>One last thing, maybe the Warden should take the regular amount of knockback when being hit with a weapon that has the knockback II enchantment on it.

The style of ruined or damaged ancient cities hasn't evolved since old school nether fortresses or jungle temples. It feels repetitive and annoying to have some small bits of loot and to the advanced player it is almost useless without its skulk blocks to do Redstone with. Even if part of the cities can be used mechanically for very advanced players I think that, the part that is advanced should stay(skulk sensors blast resistant blocks exp farms.) In the Minecraft live for 2020 the showcase of the deep dark seemed to be more lowkey and something you could stumble on to and be in serious trouble. You would have to play smart to avoid and could be very scary and stressful. These small patches of deep dark not connected to the city are easy to avoid and create no emotion. The cities themselves are optional and very lackluster visually and I would swap them out for something like a large valley encased in dripstone that at the center holds loot but almost guaranties death very close to the bottom and hard to dig around(unbreakable or slow breaking blocks) as well as some narrow caves that are smaller versions more based on the fact that you would never go there on purpose. Last is that the warden needs to be useful in someway nothing too important that you almost cannot live without it like elytra but something fun and fresh because lately it seems like mob drops have been really boring and useless.</p>",

The Warden should be in an environment where it can freely move around and catch the player easily.</p>\n<p>-I was able to loot the Ancient cities without being killed with the Warden, but I was definitely disrupted by it's appearances. The Ancient cities themselves unfortunately feel a little too easy to loot. All the chests are visible and the structure overall feels somewhat linear and easy to navigate. I enjoyed Bastion Remnants because to this day I still struggle to find all the loot, there are hidden rooms and lot's of variety. I wish the structure had more variety in the kinds of rooms/ruins we will see, more variety in size and shape, perhaps hidden passageways and chests which are harder to find, a structure that is overall more difficult and complex to navigate and perhaps more detail and references. I really liked the bathhouse remains for example. As it's a late game structure and very old, i want it to be packed with detail and secrets!</p>",

Feel like it should not be as affected by fluids as it is, since it can be easily pinned into a corner with a single water bucket. It is also relatively easy to pillar up, tunnel down, or simply block in the Warden. Breaking blocks could solve these problems, but some sort of shock wave attack, or even some sort of vibration based attack that makes blocks in a small area permeable would be interesting.</p>\n<p>Looting chest seemed feasible, but hopefully as the difficulty of the Warden (likely) increases, so will the loot table for the deep dark city chests. Feels like the challenge is greater than looting end cities, so the reward should be at the very least comparable. Swift Sneak is an exciting new enchantment which would make the trip worthwhile, but perhaps having better loot and maybe having the new music disc be exclusive to the cities would make them more worth visiting. Additionally, I feel that Swift Sneak would be an excellent leggings enchantment. The boots are already so saturated with enchants (Feather Falling, Frost Walker, Depth Strider, Soul Speed), and it seems fitting that some sort of enchanted pants would allow you to squat and sneak more effectively.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I hope that all of the properties of the reinforced deepslate are intended (moveable with pistons, doesn't drop anything, wither resistant, hard to mine, etc.).

I think it'll be good to see the Warden be harder to avoid, but clearly that's still being worked on.</p>\n<p>Everyone here is discussing how to make the Warden more of a challenge...What I want to do is talk about how to throw it off your scent when it finds you. When it's speed increases and it targets you specifically, it's very, very hard to get it to stop being agro'ed on you. If you simply bore a hole in the wall, it doesn't seem like it will ever leave because it still knows exactly where you are, and will just stand there and wait.</p>\n<p>While I think it's appropriate, given you're not supposed to make it out of there if it finds you, it makes the experience so much of a drag because you have 2 options at that point. 1, sit there and swing your sword at it 80,000 times until it dies, or 2, leave the area and hope to god it despawns. I think ways to avert its attention should be more effective... Maybe a stinkbomb made out of frog meat and fermented spider eyes in a brewing stand (or something of that nature). Or something that can temporarily stun it in it's charging state.</p>\n<p>I think the Charging State is simply too powerful, and it's more annoying and tedious than anything. It's hectic at first, it's terrifying having him barreling towards you, and I absolutely adore the way he's animated. The sound design is absolutely top notch, and the sneaking around is really fun! I think the Charging state needs some rebalancing.</p>",

Though, I feel the Warden needs those \"cheesing strats\" I've heard about, as simply building up or tunneling away was an easy escape. The damage and HP it has are fine, but it needs more mobility and intelligence.<br>2) I used creative mode to give myself gear to explore an Ancient City and went into survival to do so, as my first time exploring. While I was exploring, my first encounter with a Warden was when a skeleton accidentally set off shriekers with its arrows, and that was the first time I've felt legitimately scared from a video game for a long time. The Warden's dramatic entrance is near perfect.<br>3) Sneaking around the Warden was easy as I already knew how to do so.<br>4) Looting chests was easy as the Warden, I feel, spawns too far from the shriekers. I triggered a Warden spawn while I was looting and the Warden spawned off the side of the building and was unable to reach me.<br>5) The darkness effect is very well done, but needs toned down. Defaulting to 100% makes everything pitch black. This makes the effect feel like \"blackness\" instead of \"darkness\".<br>6) In my first encounter, I was pretty freaked out! It was hard to remember to stay still and sneak instead of running, so I feel the Warden hits a good area between \"a little freaky\" and \"horrifying\".</p>",

I have waited a long time and the warden, whilst angered, didn't go away.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, snowballs are supposed to help you sneak away right? I threw a snowball far away from me and the warden went after it. I then sneaked away. I was at least 25 blocks away from the warden, but it still eventualy sniffed me out before burrowing and traveled all the way to me and then got angered and i was forced to painstakingly kill it with a diamond axe while on a piller.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In short I really am exited for this update and I think it's been done really well. I think that the warden should be able to climb/dig/ to get to the player.

Took my first look at the snapshot in survival w/o doing research and it gives exactly the vibe I imagined from what was shared by the devs over the last few months. However, having done so, I also have some thoughts about the Warden's mechanics!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>First off, even without the \"cheese\" of pillaring up (which, to my knowledge, is getting fixed eventually), I find the Warden far too easy to escape from. Simply crouching away has been enough to save me every time I accidentally called a Warden, so as long as you keep an escape path in mind you're out scott-free the second you hear a Warden dig up.</li>\n<li>Bats! They spawn in Ancient Cities fairly often, especially with how the cities tend to overlap with other biomes (not sure if this is something that will be changed in the future), and set off skulk sensors <em>constantly.</em> While this might be an intended mechanic, it makes it incredibly hard to know if you as the Player are setting things off or if it's just another bat nearby.</li>\n<li>Combining the first two bulletpoints -- I feel that Wardens would benefit from an inability to target bats. If a bat is nearby, it sets off skulk sensors so often that the Warden almost always tracks it instead of the Player, and then the bat is so hard to catch that it gives the Player easy time to get away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, fantastic snapshot! Very excited to see the last section of development play out!</p>",

I think I would like the darkness effect much more if it didn't flash at random, where I kind of just hope I'm looking at the right place at the right time, but rather the player did something that allows you a brief moment of visibility. maybe crouching still for one full second lifts the darkness a bit, until you start walking or moving around? It would be a slightly risky maneuver but would let you stop and see where the warden is, then sneak away in short bursts of careful movement. I would like that style of gameplay MUCH more and I think it would make me actually enjoy the darkness effect!</p>\n<p>I also REALLY dislike not being able to place torches or other blocks at risk of alerting the shriekers.

The property that I'm referring to is its ability to be moved by pistons, but be fully blast resistant, even to the Wither's blue skull projectile. If this is planned to be removed, I implore the dev team to reconsider. This property would give this block and the Ancient Cities that it's found in a unique significance that no other block in the game provides. The fact that Reinforced Deepslate cannot be mined and must be transported by pistons to a new location makes it unlikely to affect the expirience of more casual players while still providing more advanced, technical players with a valuable new resource and a unique challenge in obtaining it and getting it to a desired location. I think the Reinforced Deepslate block as it is currently implemented in this snapshot would allow for some really amazing possibilities while still not upsetting the overall balance of the game.</p>\n<p>In short, please have the Reinforced Deepslate keep it's blast resistance and its ability to be moved by pistons.</p>",

All I really did was put distance between us, which is really easy since he searches so slowly.

Once it spawns in, you can just sprint about 50 blocks away from it since it doesn't detect you while emerging. Water and lava bring it to a stop, allowing you to escape. Piling up or digging tunnels are super effective killing methods. Running away from shriekers as they're shrieking is an instant escape. Mining them as they're shrieking stops the warden from spawning entirely, but that requires a lightning-fast reaction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Although end crystals are effective, they are not practical since they can only be placed on a few specific blocks. The warden's damage seems to be armor piercing since it deals 15 points of damage on full diamond armor set and 9 on a full protection IV netherite armor set. Armor piercing damage is great since it reduces the effectiveness of the armor against the warden.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The darkness effect is too dark. The player should be able to see at least 12 blocks away so they can make quick decisions. The real terror will be if they run into a dead end and didn't see it coming until it's too late, but were still able to see where they were going to get to the dead end.&nbsp;</p>",

Or maybe some sort of pulse that when the warden hears many vibrations but cannot reach the player, he releases this pulse in all directions that deals some damage and knockback.<br><br>Another Solution would be to make the Warden be able to climb on the side of blocks with a cool animation so pillar-ing up wouldn't work? Another idea would be for the Warden to be able to burrow through the ground to find you, we already know that the warden can burrow into blocks and come out of them, so maybe he could dig through the wall to reach you if you have dug in.<br><br>Finally I think making the Warden be able to crawl through tight spaces to reach you when he otherwise is too tall to fit could also be cool<br><br>I feel like those would make the warden nearly impossible to cheese and make the players understand that the Warden is not to be messed with, other than those things the warden really is a scary mob and facing off against him in survival was a real challenge! The ancient city structures are my new favorite structures in the game.</p>",

But I'm here to give my feedback on how I think it could be improved.</p>\n\n<p>1. The biome\n<br />A lot of people I saw said it and I agree, the Deep Dark needs to look more like a biome. The Skulk needs to be more spread out, it needs more decoration blocks to add to the atmosphere, maybe something hanging from the roof, this kind of things.</p>\n\n<p>2. The Warden\n<br />I think the Warden should only emerge from Skulk Blocks and shouldn't go too far away from where the spread is, so that could add to the idea that the Warden is part of the spreading and is a guardian to the Ancient City and the Deep Dark itself. It could also serve so players could escape the Warden going away from the biome until it stop chasing them, making it a menace only for who stays in the biome. It would also open the possibility to make the mob even harder since it would be limited only to the Deep Dark.</p>\n\n<p>3. Ancient Cities\n<br />There's nothing I could say about it, they're perfect. There's only a few generation issues and the loot needs improving, but I imagine these are things that you guys are already planning to solve. I see that you guys seems to have some things planned that we don't even now about yet. So I can't wait to see everything that is being prepared. Good job!</p>",

Hounds also have insane speed when they heard a player, faster than a sprinting player (not sprint-jumping). Hound then turns hostile and attacks the player with the warden, and can make a screeching sound that makes warden more angry and knockbacks the player (to prevent players from towering up and safely killing the warden.). hounds also hate bats and make special sounds that causes their echolocation to fail and they die from flying into walls and stuff. The hound could look like a sculk-infested wolf or something else entirely. Last ability would be to call the warden to bring loud mobs to the ground with him, instead of to make him burrow out of the ground. sculk then would spread according to its exp value.&nbsp;</p>",

Well... I towered up and punched him with my fist. Like... the Most Powerful beast. beaten with a few punches of my hand. I don't think this was intentional, however it makes the warden significantly less scary than he is supposed to be, and really makes me hope this will be changed ASAP! but other than that major change, the Warden was actually very fun to avoid, it made me actually feel scared, and that is what i want to see from the warden. Just fix the towering and it's a 20/10 for me!</p>",

Before I talk about warden cheeses I want to say how I think that no music should play if you enter the deep dark biome so that is it eerily quiet and it is just you, the warden, the cave, and the sculk. Okay now for the warden cheeses: bats. When a warden is angery it can get distracted by the bat and I found that annoying do I think you guys should remove bats from the deep dark. Next we have power 5 bows with harming 2 arrows. Probably the highest damage weapon at the player’s disposal as it can two shot a player in full prot 4 netherite due to harming’s true damage so you guys should make the warden immune to all negative potions like harming, poison, slowness, etc, but maybe make it to where positive can still affect him like swiftness, strength, jumpboost, healing, etc. Another warden cheese that some people aren’t talking about too much is wool. Placing and breaking wool should still trigger sculk blocks like every other block so you can’t just bridge through the whole place. Another cheese that I saw was how players were jumping around on the taller parts of the city so some sculk sensors should be placed around there to pick up player movements. The last cheese that no one had talked about is fishing rods and holes. You can lure the warden into a hole to get stuck and use the fishing rod to kill it with fall damage.</p>",

You can pillar up, you can put down water buckets, you can put down lava buckets and it easily avoids them.</p>\n<p>Suggestions: the warden should only be able to emerge or tunnel back down through sculk blocks. This would be a better way of being able to use shriekers in builds but also making \"security systems\" for your base.</p>\n<p>The warden should be able to phase through sculk blocks and come back out of them as he pleases or when angry. He should also be able infect small areas of blocks and get to players by doing this. This would fix virtually every cheese as the warden could get extremely angry and move very fast to get to the player no matter the cheese.</p>\n<p>While you guys probably have plans for the middle \"portal\" a fast travel thing would be so incredible for this. It could be activated by some late game block (maybe nether star) and be linked to one other portal in the world like portal a goes to the other portal a in the world. If you try to activate a third portal with block a it would do nothing. This would be an effective way to travel large distances in the late game without the nether.&nbsp;</p>",

Yes it makes the most sense to go on the boots, but there's already four boot exclusive enchantments, Frost Walker, Feather Falling, Depth Strider, and Soul Speed. I'd instead suggest having Swift Sneak be a leggings enchantment, as there are no leggings exclusive enchantments.</p>\n<p>One more small issue, the loot in the Ancient Cities is severely lacking. Yes, enchanted books are nice as is the Swift Sneak enchantment, but unless villagers won't sell Swift Sneak there's no reason to go into the cities. Take End Cities for example. They have exclusive end game items that allow the player to do things no other item allows. And while I don't think an item as game changing as elytra should be in the end cities, it at least needs something better then Swift Sneak.</p>",

Not sure if there is any particular reason for this, but being able to keep a specific Warden in the world would be a fun feature that could lead to a different things the player can do to interact with it. Some ideas would be to; have it remain in a certain area; acting as a guard mob for a player's base or some form of highly dangerous neighbor; or simply to have an angry companion in the cold of the deep dark biome. ;)</p>\n<p>Second: Too easily can a player simply pillar up with any block they have and dodge any form of challenge that the Warden is there to provide. Giving the Warden some property like climbing or a ranged-esc attack can benefit the warden and equally challenge the player into focusing on sneaking around the warden, rather than just bumbling through deep dark biomes and then pillaring up with blocks when a Warden threatens them.</p>\n<p>This snapshot was amazing and really got me hyped for the next update that is coming. I can't wait to explore these new areas and see what will become of them in the future. I hope that greater interactions with the Warden will become more apparent with future updates and I am looking forward to what new features will be added. Great work on giving me nightmares while traversing through these stunning caves!&nbsp;</p>",

The ancient cities look STUNNING! The only things I have to add is perhaps make the shriekers fire TWICE before the Warden appears? In my testing, it seems like one shriek is all that is needed. I also feel like the loot of cities should be far greater, more on par with End Cities, OR add something unique that can be found in the chests (perhaps a potion ingredient for haste? Or maybe a new effect, Sneaky?) The warden is also rather easy to cheese. Lava, pillars, digging into a wall. It would be far nicer if the warden could climb, similar to a spider? And perhaps LAVA resistance. I'm aware that the Warden is a subterranean creature, sunlight would still hurt it. Also, perhaps Leather Boots would muffle walking? Perhaps the range of the vibrations is decreased? </p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading! \n<br />-LordQwerty</p>",

The warden really presents a challenge in it of itself specially if you're not expecting him and don't know what to do. Also, the warden can be easily cheesed but if it aggroes at you there is like no time for you to pillar up to kill him (because of his speed) also, i would really enjoy for the reinforced deepslate to be obtanable in survival, it's a block with very unique properties and i would like for this block to remain the same with the bonus that it can be mined in survival. If you're planning for this block to have a special portal or something to another dimesion then leave it as is. also, I loved the ancient cities and all of the sculk blocks, they are very unique and have very cool properties.</p>",

And new players would have absolutely NO idea what they are facing! My friend has just started playing and I brought him down to a Deep Dark biome, then he activated all the shriekers without knowing and thought the Warden was a passive mob because it didn't attack. Then he pulled out his sword and got insta-killed before he could land a single hit. Not like he knew of its many complex mechanics.</p>\n<p>Also, it would be totally cool if a chase theme played whenever the Warden was chasing you to add to the suspense of the fight-or-flight moment (especially since flight is the only option)</p>\n<p>Apparently, the loot chests were going to have never-before-seen loot with abilities that were extremely beneficial. How about a helmet that makes mobs not notice you? I know mob skulls already achieve this effect, but something that lasted for longer would be better.

I'll sort this list by priority of what should be changed.</p>\n<p>1. The Warden NEEDS to follow any vibration instantly, and its pathfinding NEEDS to be fixed. The current Warden ignores over half the vibrations it detects, quite literally defeating the purpose of being a warden. The Warden also won't follow a vibration if it's still wandering from when it was idle- use entity.getNavigation.stop(); and THEN tell it to move to fix this.</p>\n<p>2. The Warden should be able to attack anything it's sniffed once or detected one vibration from if it's close enough. The current Warden doesn't do this, and is therefore no challenge.</p>\n<p>3. The amount of damage a Warden can take at a time should be capped at around 10.</p>\n<p>4. The roaring mechanics NEED to be revised. The Warden should only follow something it roared at for 6 seconds after it sniffs or detects it, and afterwards, it shouldn't be able to follow it. The current Warden suddenly gains eyesight after it roars.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Although I have not played it since I don't play Java edition, here is my general feedback</p>\n\n<p>1. I would like to see fog in the deep dark/ancient city's to get that horror atmosphere a little more as development continues </p>\n\n<p>2. From videos that I have seen, it is too easy to cheese the warden. Pillar up like 3 to 5 blocks and you could easily kill it. Maybe later down the road add 2 to 3 ways for the warden to stop you from pillaring or escaping away from the warden. Because in my opinion, it needs to be a little bit faster for the warden to catch up to you. But I'm sure you guys can find ways to implement these ideas/feedbacks</p>\n\n<p>3.  More new loot in the dark deep city's. Right now the new enchantment is very cool and useful, but there is still not a reason to go down there. Maybe a new item that so many people really enjoy like the eltyra. Or maybe it involves a new way to play the game. Or even maybe like a huge new crafting recipe that creates a new weapon, way to heal, tool or even a new food</p>\n\n<p>4. I feel like the deep dark biome is slacking it's environment. Maybe some new scary decorations or scary blocks to add to the deep dark for its horror side of the game. </p>\n\n<p>5. Maybe in the near future of the warden, maybe it avoids the water so it doesn't get stuck as often or completely. Or maybe it swims faster at the same speed as the player </p>\n\n<p>Thats all I have for now and can't wait for more to come\n</p>",

A useful new drop would be nice but I think a challenge advancement would also be a nice reward, especially since the Warden isn't included in the Monsters Hunted advancement.</p>",

This could make a scary immersive situation where one could be strip mining near a skulk growth, awaken the warden, and then try to escape as the warden punches through the rock towards the player. However, a possibly more elegant solution would be to let the warden crouch or crawl/squeeze through a hole or corridor, thus shortening or constricting its hitbox size to get to a hiding player. This would also help because the Warden is the tallest mob, which could restrict its moving ability especially in the complex and cramped setting of the Ancient City. Great work so far on the Warden and Ancient Cities, this is shaping out to be a very immersive part of the game!</p>",

I have been waiting for this moment for a really long time :D<br>I think the deep dark looks cool but personally I would have expected a bit more \"biome-vibes\" with the deep dark itself. As the deep dark is part of the caves, there are mobs. That means, if I get close to a shrieker, the warden will spawn immediately (feels a bit too easy for it to spawn) and will never despawn, as it will chase after all the mobs in the cave.<br>Personally as someone with an anxiety disorder I feel like the darkness Effekt is too dark. I would like to at least see a bit more of my surroundings. I tried the accessibility setting and turned the darkness Effekt down but that also felt a bit harsh, the Effekt is pitch black or pitch black and more far away or completely off. I would like it more if it would fade into darkness.<br>I also feel like the darkness Effekt in combination with the heart beat could be extremely scary to children. I am a 27 year old grown up and it made me pause the game as it felt too scary.<br>BUT, the ancient Citys look AMAZING! I am in LOVE with these structures. I feel like they need a bit more unique loot for me to want to get down there and explore. Especially with the risk of the warden one hitting me.<br>Also my personal wish. Please make the structure in the middle a portal to another dimension at some point. That would be amazing and would make me want to get down there even though the warden scares the living *** out of me :D</p>",

Though my biggest problem is ancient city, it has no incentives beside messing around with warden. Loot chest is terrible, not really worth the exploring, the city needs something else than swift sneak enchantment. Now i did see reinforced deepslate which i don't know what mojang will do with that, hopefully a portal to another dimension like the end or the nether or home of warden or sth.. to explore even further with more items for end game contents like ancient debris in the nether (something like beacon 2.0 that let you instamine wood or deepslate with netherite gear). Still this snapshot is a good one to see mojang's decision to make the game a bit more difficult which i appreciate a lot</p>",

I spent a lot of time figuring out how it worked.</p>\n<p>My problems with the Warden arise in how cheesable it is.</p>\n<p>Aside from the obvious \"build 3 blocks upwards and wait for him to go\" You can also just dig a small hole to escape it, but my major problems come when it came into contact of Water and Lava.</p>\n<p>The Warden is a terrible swimmer, and can be defeated with a single bucket of lava and is almost unable to go past a stream of water.</p>\n<p>An Idea I have is that the Warden could be able to ignore streams of water, and walk past it as if it isn't there. As for lava, it should be fire resistant, since it has no real reason to be damaged by fire.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All in all, I think this stuff is great, and I'm excited to see it fully implemented, but please make sure that the warden can't be cheesed.</p>",

The Warden should know how to climb and swim so that it is not so easy to run away from him, also in the Ancient City there are many obstacles that you can use to your advantage, places that you can cross but that the Warden cannot. I also see that there is an error with the Sculk Shriekers, and that is that when the 3 warning attempts have already occurred and then The Warden comes, after that throughout the world every time you activate a sculk shrieker The Warden will always come regardless of the place of the world and will skip the 2 or 3 warning attempts and The Warden will always come out from under the ground.</p>",

Unfortunately, while the warden is essentially impossible to fight head on without the use of enchanted golden apples along side the very best equipment, it remains extremely easy to cheese, through the use of a pillar that's a couple of blocks tall and standing on top of it. I would really like to see something done to make it harder to cheese in such a way, perhaps allowing it to burrow its way up the pillar when enraged, as it does when spawning. But this is just an another case of players optimising the fun out of a game and I can absolutely understand the decision of keeping this cheese in the game.

My first glance at the ancient city was awe-inspiring and terrifying in equal measure. These structures are, without a doubt, the coolest ever added to Minecraft. The biome has come so far from being a ravine with sculk on the floor and a cabin carved into the wall. I love how rich with history the cities are--they really make you wonder about how the city came to be abandoned, more so than any other structure.</p>\n<p>On to useful feedback:</p>\n<p>The sculk seems a little too easy to defeat. You can usually disable a shrieker by breaking a single sensor next to it and then breaking the shrieker. (Once or twice, I occasionally set off a shrieker to speed along the process of summoning the Warden.) This could have two potential solutions: there could be a higher chance of multiple sensors generating next to shriekers, or the shriekers could be able to detect when a sensor around it gets broken. That would increase the difficulty of clearing out sculk patches, but it might make it too hard.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, the sculk catalysts seem...kind of useless. They don't always generate in the center of sculk patches, and as there are no mobs but the Warden around, it's not entirely intuitive that the catalysts spread the sculk. Is there a way the catalysts could be more useful in the Deep Dark? Could they be given another feature?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>[Continued in next comment]</p>",

I was utterly horrified by the biome as a whole, and I absolutely loved it. I do have a couple nuggets of feedback, though. I didn't cheese the Warden in order to preserve the creepy atmosphere, but even then it would sometimes get stuck between walls and not be able to pathfind to me. What if the Warden had the ability to burrow and then pop out at another sculk patch closer to you? That would definitely make it harder to escape, although to keep it balanced I think it should only do that if you're relatively close but also unreachable.</p>\n<p>The Warden should be able to swim faster and be immune to fire, have longer reach, and all that stuff. Basically, make it immune to all but the most elaborate cheeses. One way it could reach you through walls is by burrowing down and popping up in another sculk patch that's closer to you. Currently, if the Warden can't reach you, you basically just have to wait for it go away.</p>\n<p>[To be continued again, I swear this'll be the last time]</p>",

While this is a good way to cheese the warden, I think it makes the fight too easy. Another issue is that I've explored about 20 cities, and all of them have been in a dripstone cave. That by itself is fine, but the problem is that the dripstone caves override the generation of a deep dark city, and one city had the center partially deleted by a dripstone cave. I'm 99% sure that a Mojang developer tweeted that wardens would burn in daylight, but they don't. I also think it's weird that a warden would rather kill a bat than a player.</p>",

Basically, Deep Dark caves should be:</p>\n<p>-Bigger (closer to the size of lush/dripstone caves)</p>\n<p>-They should have biome-specific formations and features, like maybe sculk tendrils hanging from the ceilings? There could be candles on the ground and occasional soul lanterns. Stuff like that would be cool.</p>\n<p>-All Deep Dark caves should have at least one, small structure. Not trying to speak for the development team, but if you look at the implied story behind the ancient cities, it seems that a lot of things died there-it seems that there were lots of ritual sacrifices in particular. It doesn't make sense for sculk to have taken over a cave for no reason, so I think there should be, if an ancient city can't generate, one or two small structures around the size of ocean ruin buildings. That would keep a consistent narrative with the idea that the people who built the cities were the ones that caused the sculk to spread. Of course, it might be too difficult to implement that way; I'm not completely sure how structure generation is coded. Keep up the good work!</p>",

        "body": "<p>The Warden is so awesome and I LOVE it! The pulsing darkness is terrifying because you can only see the Warden if it's within a dozen or so blocks of you, and by that point you're mostly screwed. Even when I turn hitboxes on, it's still incredibly hard to see and it's thrilling, I love it. I also like how the Warden isn't just a single, one-time boss, and how you can keep summoning them (and the animation is so epic). However, there's a couple things I think could be changed for the better. First things first, the loot is complete dookie, so please add things like gear and ores or something like that. Maybe there could even be netherite ingots in chests because netherite looks amazing with deepslate, so the theme would match, but idk. Secondly, the Warden can't attack you if you're 2 or more blocks above it, which means that if you pillar two blocks up you can't be damaged. I think that first off the Warden should have a hit height of at least 3-4 blocks, maybe more. Next, I think that something should be done to stop players just making a wall a block off the ground to stop the Warden from getting them—which I know is already hard in the pitch-black—maybe either making it able to jump 2 blocks off the ground (though it would look dumb and funny) or it could possibly break blocks. A third option could be that when a certain amount of time has passed when the Warden is angry. and can't get the player, it calls on others to help it. Out of room now, maybe make the limit 2000?</p>",

Next to the Warden, I thought it was terrifying but one loop pull I found in my personal experience was using a punch 2 bow, ender pearl, and lava pool. I would make a&nbsp; lot of noise during the warden used the pearl to get behind it and used my bow to knock it into the lava pool.

The bats that spawn outside of the Deep Dark biome fly into the deep dark biome and trigger the skulk sensors and skulk shriekers making the Warden spawn without me making a single vibration! The bats are a good distraction when the Warden is looking for me but when there is no Warden to distract they are just constantly flying over the skulk sensors triggering them which summons the Warden. The real threat wasn't the Warden but THE BATS!!! THE BATS!!! THE BATS!!!<br>THE BAAAAAAAATTTSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&nbsp;<br><br>Though other than the Warden and THE BATS!!! I like how absolutely terrifying the darkness effect is especially on moody light level.&nbsp;</p>",

The ancient city is mostly walls occasionally broken up by a ruined house (which makes sense for an ancient city) it felt more like an ancient temple, which would also be fine, I'd be fine with it being one large structure with the tiny loot areas in, or around it, akin to the Jungle Temples, but more unique and larger, but as of right now the ancient city feels incomplete, and I'm hoping its just because this is experimental.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I wasn't able to loot chests without dying until I found out about wool's effect - then it became easier to loot by surrounding the chest with wool. The darkness effect I was worried was going to dampen the experience but I really enjoyed the fact that it only enacted when the Warden was around. I wanted to be able to explore the city without my eyesight being hindered but also get the fear that comes with the effect. I got both. No joke- terrifying.

I recommend that the warden should be able to climb up walls and break through blocks that are weaker than obsidian. This will prevent us, players, from simply towering or hiding behind a wall. If you do agree with the warden being able to climb, I would think that it should climb up slowly and if its target jumps down from the tower, it should leap at its escaping target ONLY if it has been climbing. If you don't agree with the warden being able to climb, I think it should dig underground in the vicinity of the target's tower and emerge once the target comes back down. If the target starts to bridge from the tower, the warden should emerge, track them, then dig back underground when they stop bridging. Since the warden's attack animation is like a swing, I think it should have an AoE attack and a longer attack range. Finally, I have noticed that the warden's animations and sounds aren't always in sink. Can you fix that if you can?</p>",

Whether its intentional or not, it feels out if place in the stone caves.</p>\n\n<p>Third, why is the biome just splotches of skulk? I understand the functionality of the catalyst, but why would the biome be dependent upon where the catalysts are (If anything I'd think the biome creates the catalysts)? As a biome, I would have imagined almost the entire cave (floor, walls, and ceiling) being covered in skulk and bone (see above) blocks.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, what does the biome itself have to offer? All the appeal of exploring the Deep Dark is in the ancient cities with the prospect of finding unique loot. The Warden provides a nice challenge guarding that loot (and/or city), yet it can still spawn in the biome where there is no loot for it to protect. So, why have the biomes generate without cities, or why not have something else in the biome worth the Warden's protection?</p>\n\n<p>It may be incomplete, but the Deep Dark seems like it may be the most interesting aspect of modern Minecraft.

There may be a way to get it working in a way that very closely matches the effect used without ray tracing though. I'd suggest using same distance based fog as the blindness effect normally uses with RTX (although the bug with distance fog only using the skybox colours instead of the defined colours would have to be fixed to implement this properly), and to mimic the behaviours of the darkness creeping upon the light levels of emissive blocks, the irradiance cache data could be temporarily flushed. This would result in the secondary bounce GI disappearing temporarily, which would make the distance that PBR emissive light travels become very small in that time period.</p>\n<p>Through RTX the Warden has the potential to be an incredible experience, hoping to see these features implemented!</p>",

If you want the deep dark to be something you encounter on accident for the spookiness factor, then I suggest maybe making it something players <strong>can feasibly encounter in the first place</strong>. From the testing I've done so far, it seems like on average you would have to be mining 1000 to 3000 blocks out in every possible direction to find one of these, and even then, it's way easier to miss underground biomes and structures compared to surface ones. I only found the ancient city in the second deep dark biome I found because I made several long and methodical tunnels, basically strip mining for it. No idea how someone is supposed to find that on accident, especially if they don't know it even exists.</p>",

However, as suggested in one of the top comments, an evoker fang-like spell attack, or \"sculk spikes\" would be best for several reasons.<br>1.) It looks cool and would be more unique.<br>2.) This spell would be summoned near the ground, which is where the player would be at all times anyway. So even if they pillared or dug into a wall, the spell would still reach them as it would spawn beneath their feet. Though, players can still use an elytra to escape. But this might not be a problem as flying around inside of a cave while having the darkness effect might not be the best idea anyway. But if you wanted, you could also make the spell grow vertically to reach the player.&nbsp;<br>3.) This solution is pretty universal. There is nothing a player could do to escape from it. Blocking off the warden, pillaring, digging, bridging and then removing the blocks - all of these tactics would be thwarted (as long as the warden isn't distracted by a bat or something. Hey, that gives this spell another use! They would be able to kill bats easier!). Except maybe ender pearl (and elytra as mentioned before). However, maybe you could make the attack track the player so that the spell would hit them even if they pearled. But it only tracks IF the warden is locked on, so players can still get away if they are being sneaky.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>Looking at the other comments I realized there were ways I could have cheesed it, but I will say from my first experiences that I loved it. He is very tanky (it took 46 hits with a sharpness V netherite sword to kill him), and he also does a lot of damage (6 heats even will full netherite armor), which is exactly what I'm hoping for because he has to feel like an extreme threat to make stealth feel necessary. I suppose it would be possible to climb on a pillar to escape him, but it feels like it wouldn't be worth killing him like that since another one could just spawn when you make more noise, and it would also take quite a while. I think him not dropping any loot enhances this, because it means players have even less incentive to try to kill him, and more incentive to just stay quiet and sneak around.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I also really liked the darkness effect, I almost wanted to make it more intense (maybe like 110% in the darkness effect slider) because it adds a certain layer of mytique that makes the warden feel less like a miniboss and more like a force of nature. I'm not sure scared is exactly the right word, but watching him sniff the air for you as the world gets darker is certainly tense.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm not sure what changes need to be made, but I'd say if anything make him a little more common, easier to call out. Maybe make a few wardens spawn naturally, with more spawning when you make a lot of noise. Having a deep dark heist with your friends would be one of the coolest things in the game.</p>",

The Warden itself, seems easy to get around, so I think maybe some enderman block moving mechanic or some explosive mechanic is needed. In regards to the deep dark itself, it feels like there is no deep dark biome, just patches of skulk everywhere. When I think 'moving' to a new biome, I think of a color shift and scenery change. For the deep dark, I expected some kind of skulk grass flooding the field, growing with veins and blocks. That way its harder to see the default stone/deepslate. In addition, a constant brightness dim when entering the biome could signal players that they are in a dangerous place, maybe even a weaker version of blindness.</p>",

Great job Mojang!</p>\n<p>A few ideas for making the Warden threatening to even the most knowledgeable of players:</p>\n<p><strong>Random Summoning </strong>- We fear the unknown. In horror, the monster is scariest when it is off-screen. It might be cool if the Warden took&nbsp;<em>at least</em> three shrieker calls to be summoned, but this was added to by a random amount. That way, it'll be impossible to predict exactly when it'll strike, but the player will still have plenty of margin for error.</p>\n<p><strong>\"Giving Up\"</strong> - If the Warden is chasing the player but can't pathfind to it for a certain duration of time, it might just give up and decide to burrow into the ground. This will make the Warden difficult to cheese. Especially if it follows through with the next idea...</p>\n<p><strong>Burrowing to Reach the Player</strong> - If the Warden can burrow through blocks canonically, why couldn't it just burrow through them to reach the intruders of its home? Arguably this makes the Warden very difficult to cheese.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are just a few ideas, feel free to nitpick a favorite. I'm no professional game dev, so these could be terrible ideas. Whatever ends up making it into the game, I'm sure it'll be awesome. Stay safe everyone.</p>",

        "body": "<p>The warden should be able to \"attack vibrations.\" Let me explain. So how it currently works is the warden never attacks anything unless it IS attacked or it reaches its anger threshold. I think in addition to these, upon hearing a vibration, the warden should attack that spot. This makes interactions with other mobs less awkward.Ok so lets say you bring your pet dog to the deep dark. It takes a while for the warden to get angry and attack it. But with my idea, the warden would hear the dog walking and swing its arms to attack the spot where it heard it. It might not hit it, but it would keep any players with pets on their toes! Obviously this doesn't just apply to pets.If you throw a snowball, the warden will hear it, go to that spot, and investigate that spot by hitting it. Nothing is there, so it walks around aimlessly for a while before sniffing. Oh yeah, and this should apply to sniffing too. If it sniffs a player, it should hit the spot where it thinks the player is. The player will have probably moved on from that spot but this would be a really great way of teaching the players that the warden is blind. You've already done a great job designing this part of the warden - previous encounters with sculk blocks will teach them that it responds to vibration. However, this would be a little extra thing. And it makes complete sense, too. If the warden hears a vibration, of course it would try to attack it, even if there's nothing there, it doesn't know that nothing is there.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>So, after playing a little more in survival and actually dealing with the Warden, I have some thoughts.</p>\n<p>One, I think the sculk needs to do more to help him. Make the sculk veins also give away your vibrations when putting wool on it, make the screechers more sensitive, and make it so that screechers can go off while the warden is already there, and he'll quickly run over to it (if he doesn't already smell you). I can throw a whole stack of snowballs into an area littered with sensors and screechers, but it won't do a thing until I get close to them. And sometimes, even when I make a noise around half a dozen sensors, the screecher right next to them won't do anything. I think they just need to be more on the ball to make it feel more threatening, otherwise I just just run right through.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Second, the warden needs the ability to climb, and the ability to teleport to you (like when he hears a screecher). You can just outrun him and makes tons of noise, which just make it feel silly. I just spent most of the time walking on top of the many city walls since he can't do anything about it, even if he does hear me.</p>\n<p>Finally, the loot needs to be better. The occasional enchanted book is cool, but getting mostly bones and candles feels unrewarding in a place that is pretty hard to scope out and slow to move through. The rewards should feel like they're guarded by a one-shotting monster,&nbsp; especially if he's changed to be smarter and more threatening.</p>",

The Warden can't go through water or lava, it can be bypassed with a 4 block pillar, and it can't reach you if you strip mine in a certain way to avoid it. I think the Warden should be able to walk through walls seeing as it just kinda comes out of the ground when it spawns. I think it should also be able to walk through lava or water like its nothing. With the amount of lava or water streams there are in caves, there needs to be a fix for this.</p>",

This way players will not just tower up or hide in a small hole. It's also easy to kill if you use a water bucket to slow him down with the flowing water.

        "body": "<p>The fact that it is so easy to cheese the Warden in its current state makes it seem less scary/threatening to me. I have a few ideas/suggestions for abilities the Warden could have for a few easy cheese strategies. These would be different responses of the Warden for different situations where the player cheeses it. These would give an added benefit of making the Warden seem intelligent and strong, to the point of seeming uncanny, giving a scary feeling to the player on top of not being able to escape using cheap tactics. First of all, if the player pillars up to get out of the Warden's reach, the Warden could start slowly climbing up the pillar. This could have its own lively animation too, where it grabs around the edge of the block with its arms, and pulls itself up. This would create some really fun moments of panic for the player. Another situation would be for the Warden to be able to hunch over to be 2 blocks high, to stop players from blocking the Warden away. This also creates some scary moments. Another big issue is the use of water to control Warden's movement, or keep the Warden trapped. Maybe the Warden shouldn't be affected by this, or the Warden can do a move which makes the water sources around it disappear. I also like the idea of the skulk itself seeming a bit more alive. Maybe if you're still for too long, the skulk growth grows toward you and releases poisonous spores or something (happening only when the Warden is active).</p>",

Also, reduce the smelling range, it makes summoning the warden a death sentence. he can smell you even if you cannot see him with the darkness effect. Also one last thing; the warden should charge at you if you make him too angry, but only in the direction it got the last vibration from. so if you move out of the way while sneaking, the warden will run past you for about 10 blocks, or until it hits a wall.</p>",

The warden being easily cheesed is something I trust will be fixed and I think I heard something about the warden's roar shaking the player off and blocks, but then I read something about him being able to climb in another comment, which sounds awesome. one thing though, is this makes his roar do nothing again. This brings me to my idea for a new feature.&nbsp;<strong>I have seen the ancient cities merge with dripstone caves quite a bit, and I think it would be so cool if when the warden roars, your screen shakes, and then any pointed dripstone in a nearby area falls and crashes to the ground. This would be a cool way of showing his power, and also another method of attack. I have had this idea for about a week, and then completely forgot about this feedback website so it is a bit later than the others. Even if this doesn't get added, this will still be a very amazing update and I am very excited about the future of this game!</strong></p>",

Reading trough other comments I do believe climbing would be and interesting counter.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Personally I would love to see a mechanic that makes it harder to escape the warden. Vines to pull you back could impede fleeing quickly on the wool paths in the city. A slow crushing/digging through blocks could both prevent certain cheesing strategies and make it harder for the warden to get trapped or stuck.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The skulk mechanics are totally awesome. The placement and concentration of sensors and shriekers make is possible yet dangerous to travel the cities. My favorite part is working out how to destroy sensors or shriekers without summoning the warden. It's a high stakes puzzle game with the reward of safeer looting.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is very disappointing when you go through all the work to safely get to a chest when the only loot is bones and candles. The books are really nice but there are better ways to get enchantments.</p>\n<p>The cave generation around the cities can be a bit funky. Often times there are 1 block wide walls between sections of the city and it is quite obvious where the structures spawn spaces are. The same goes for the ends of the wool paths/walls ending in flat walls that stand out form the amazing caves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Overall love the update and great work!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

So that way you can travel from one city to another, 1 time only. Each time the portal is deactivated, and reactivated once again, it syncs with a different ancient city. That way, it would become more of and adventure thing.</li>\n<li>Also, when it its activated, it can trigger the summon of some wardens in the city, and if summoned this way they stay around a little more than usual.</li>\n<li>Hope you guys use this idea. For me it would be SOOO cool to have those adventures traveling distances with those portals. But, no excpectations. Game development can be really hard and i know the team makes the better they can.</li>\n<li>Last thing! Maybe each ancient city could have its own special loot that can be used to synch a portal to that specific city, that way, if you got totally lost, you could still go home.

I would love to see the deep dark swallow up light, so all light levels in that biome would get shrinked by 2-3 levels</p>\n\n<p>2. Right now I feel the deep dark is lacking sound design (the warden it’s self is amaizng and setting off Shriners and all that is great) I would love to see a underlying slight heart beat like the biome itself is alive, I think having the lights in the biome flicker in time with the heart beat would make it feel like the biome is breathing as well.</p>\n\n<p>3. If players place torches I would love for some sort of black hand or wisp to consume the light of your torch by either breaking it or turning it off somehow.</p>\n\n<p>I would just really like to see the biome itself come to life a bit more I think the implants in the biome are fantastic but now it’s time for the general ambience. And while the deep dark may not be meant to be living I think it would be really cool to have the first ever living breathing biome in minecraft.</p>",

I think The warden should be able to kill you with full netherite on the first hit, that way when it's bugged you are still fearing of him and trying to hide, the HP of the warden is great, no compalins there, but I think the warden should be able to break blocks from his environment in order to chase you, also it takes too long for the warden to spawn I had to run around for 1 minute to activate</p>",

Even it's emerging animation glitched and it fell to ground taking fall damage. (Also it would be really cool if the warden had a death animation.)\n<br />• Again, the warden is extremely easy to cheese. When I angered it, I could tower up 4 blocks while it did the roar animation. It also got stuck in a puddle of water while chasing me. From there I could easily kill it. I even poured lava on it and used flint&amp;steel, fire aspect sword to easily take it down. So yeah... I think it would be amazing if the warden was completely FIREPROOF. I also like the idea of it be able to CLIMB up to you if you tower up. That would be horrifying and fair at the same time. \n<br />• Last but not least, mobs like spiders and creepers are still spawning in the ancient cities and sometimes they just give away my location to the skulk sensors. Please do fix this bug as it just ruins the entire experience of the deep dark. I also noticed that it attacked other mobs(if they were near it) instead of attacking me when I specifically angered it. After killing the mob it again went docile. Plz fix this as well.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, the warden was indeed scary and I had a good experience. But I really do want to see these features in it coz I really think it would be so awesome for the warden to be Minecraft's one and only INDESTRUCTIBLE  mob. </p>",

So maybe when he finally spawns he *strikes fear*. Sound ques when he spawns should be slower (so a litle longer time for him to spawn) I think. Like the start of a feighnt hearbeat that builds like you can hear him crawl through the very ground itself the hearbeat growing in power but not in speed. then when he emerges (LOVE how he legit emerges from the ground, that is great viual design) make him amit some kind of aura that makes the outlines of the screen glow in a feighnt blue hint maybe. To indicate he has spawned for the people playing without sound. Not someting too obvius but something you notice if you don't have sound on. Ofcourse you know he is going to spawn because of the darkening affect wich is great but then also add that little bit of extra when he finaly emerges from the ground and is now hunting you.<br><br>Make him spawn more easily. Not kidding i spring jumped around the ancient city not spawning him once. I can't think of more right now so hope I gave good feedback. Love the idea just add better loot in the ancient cities and more intresting sights to find down there. On simple thing I can think of would be some puzzle laborinth or something where you can find good loot but constently have to fear the warden in the laborinth or something along thoes lines.</p>",

Tired of my presence already?<br>Anyways, i've been thinking about the warden, and i have an opinion, and a analysis.</p>\n<p>First of all, let's differentiate threat and danger.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here, i'll define threat as the risk of being in danger. The higher the threat, higher is the risk of being in danger.</li>\n<li>And i'll define danger as the risk of imminent harm, damage and negative things. The higher the danger, more harm you suffer, and higher the risk of suffer a substantial and undesired damage.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With that definition:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The warden should be more unpredictable when threatening. It can be done this way: When sniffing the player, it can haver a chance to get very close, or to get just a little closer. That way, we can't get used to it's behavior(And it should be able to detect from further away).&nbsp;</li>\n<li>The warden should be more consistent and predictable in its danger. It can be done this way: Once it gets close enough, and/or detected enough sounds, it will actively chase the player from a closer distance, and only if the player stay quiet for a minute or two, it will start to lose track of the player(It means, get less close, and allowing the player to get more far from the warden). And only after that, the timer to the warden despawn starts.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hope this give you guys some ideas. One way or another, i hope that im not bothering anyone.<br>Have a nice day and thanks for the amazing game, guys!</p>",

It makes it more of a group of prison guards than a warden if that makes any sense. Doesn't feel as intimidating or monumental when you see one. I think there should be a way bigger radius within which different wardens can spawn, or rather, can exist at once. if you \"summon\" a new one the old one should dig underground first to make it seem like it's burrowing towards you. I think having the same one chasing you around makes it seem like a smarter enemy which i think is a really important illusion to sell when it comes to stealth because for me the fun in stealth comes from outsmarting enemies. having it seem smarter is also creepier/scarier somehow if it seems like its really smart and following you everywhere. lasty, killing it could therefore have a small reward of no warden for a minute and allowing the player to relax while a new one regrows.</p>",

Can't wait for the actual version to release.</p>\n<p><strong>ANS 1:</strong> YES, the Warden was challenging! It was really powerful and fast! I enjoyed a lot with the power the warden had! The one thing I didn't enjoy, was, it could sense you, even when you are sneaky. Even if you sneak, it still senses you! I also used the Warden, to prank my friends, and set traps for them.</p>\n<p><strong>ANS 2:&nbsp;</strong>When I entered the Deep Dark biome for the first time, it was scary, since i was new! I knew that I had to be careful around Sculk Sensors and Shriekers. But, while opening a chest, I accidentally set off a sensor, which gave a signal to the shrieker, causing the warden to be summoned. I went sneaky and hid behind a pillar, only to realise that it won't work. It then ended up killing me in a single hit, even through the <strong>PROTECTION IV </strong>armor.</p>\n<p><strong>ANS 3:&nbsp;</strong>After the mentioned encounter, I read the post again, and found out that towering up a few blocks, will help a lot. It would just stare at you and then cool down. If it felt bored, it would dig down and then you could continue exploring.</p>\n<p><strong>ANS 4:&nbsp;</strong>Unfortunately, no. In my first encounter, as I mentioned, opening a chest sets off a shrieker, summoning the Warden, meaning it would be the end for you!</p>\n<p><strong>ANS 5:&nbsp;</strong>The Darkness made it a lot more scary, than fighting the usual bosses, like Ender Dragon o Wither. With an utmost powerful mob like the Warden, the Darkness is a great match!</p>\n<p><strong>ANS 6:&nbsp;</strong>Yes it was really scary.</p>",

Plus i don’t understand why Netherite is weaker on Java Edition i like the old 1.8 system, it makes sense if Netherite is overkill since it’s the last game gear, what do you expect? The same thing happens with the Warden it just seems to sharp a curve for what it looks to be early-to-mid-game challenge as there has never been a sense of progression in Minecraft i don’t care how easily the Warden can be distracted, say if you have to fight it off it’d probably win the fight. The Warden breaks every balance, it makes Netherite and Diamonds pointless, grinding and working should pay off but this doesn’t, there’s no fun nor motivation the feeling you get when you have overcome every difficulty of the game vanishes instantly. It makes no sense (Overworld&gt;Nether&gt;End&gt; The overworld again?)it would have been cool if the Warden was moved in another dimension where you find better ores to fight it (Overworld&gt;Nether&gt;End&gt;?Warden Dimension?) i don’t care about people say “we are not meant to fight it” it makes the game lame and unbalanced (There is no sense of progression, this is what this game has always been lacking of) So in prior to release the Warden i suggest to wait when the new dimension gets added but it won’t be added, since my opinion doesn’t matter at all </p>",

I don’t think this makes sense for the skulk block though. I think the skulk block should drop xp from all tnt and explosions(whether it be creeper, tnt dispenser, witherskull ect.) I believe this to be the case because skulk was added to be a way to get passive xp, so an alternative was added to replace the zombie piglin agro xp bug. If xp is given from any tnt explosion, then I believe the ecological niche of the zombie piglin bug can be patched out without backlash, due to this intentional feature. Without this, then the skulk has no use. There is no reason to farm skulk other than for decoration. It’s impractical to store xp if a player has to come along and harvest it, and people will just go back to using auto clickers on regular mob farms(which autoclickers are third party, so should not be treated as something every player should do). Due to the low amount of xp in a skulk block, and the durability used for each block broken, the xp gain will not be worth it due to mending taking up most of the xp. The reason for this skulk change could be so players don’t tnt dupe, however if renewable sand and movable block entities are added, then tnt duping doesn’t need to exist either</p>\n\n<p>TLDR: if skulk doesn’t drop xp from any explosion, then it is useless as a form of storing xp, and filling the niche of a passive xp farm with no player input. </p>",

If skulk farms are supposed to be a replacement for the currently very overpowered AFK Zombified Piglin farms, then what’s the point if you can’t even AFK farm with skulk?</p>\n\n<p>As it stands, skulk is a much more balanced and interesting method to AFK XP farms. You can take multiple approaches. A more casual approach such as a small skulk setup attached to a chicken farm for small passive XP gain. Or you can go all out with a giant enderman farm setup for an awesome contraption to funnel you tons of XP while you are AFK.</p>\n\n<p>Even with TNT duping being as it currently is, allowing all explosions to drop XP is still far more balanced and interesting than Zombified Piglin farms ever were (and TNT duping is only a consideration until renewable sand and movable tile entities anyway).</p>\n\n<p>I think ultimately XP only coming from player ignited TNT doesn’t practically have any real effect on the game, especially in the context of AFK farming. However, I always appreciate all the time and effort that is put into continually improving this game over the years.

When the sculk blocks were introduced i was excited and thinking \"Oh cool! we can make another fully AFK XP farm\" which was good but then i realized 1 sculk block drops 1 xp which was pretty dissapointing tbh... If this was the case i don't think anyone would use them or they dont even come close to being a replacement for AFK zombie pigmen farms. Or another idea is maybe remove the cap on XP absorption so it can be a lot faster? But on top of that i really don't see the point if they wont drop XP when blown up by tnt dupers or even dispenser tnt... Storing xp in chests and stuff?? i mean... Maybe if one sculk block gave like 50 XP then maybe it's worth to do that but yeah...</p>\n<p>Another thing i want to mention that is not the topic of discussion of this post BUT... I really want to finally see TNT duping being fixed and renewable sand added and moveable tile entities. ilmango has a very good point and i don't know why this has not been addressed all these years? All the solutions are already out there they just need to be implemented correctly. I understand if you don't have the capacity to work on it right now, but next update please... Moveable Tile Entities would be so cool to have in java and i think they would open ideas to so many different things!</p>",

XP in ore is a gameplay method to level up and hardly carried in lore.</p>\n<p>However, I feel as if any explosion (non-player lit TNT, ghast fireball, end crystal, respawn anchor, bed in nether, creeper explosion, withers) should cause sculk drop XP. Sculk carries the XP whenever there is death, whether or not it was player caused, and isn't JUST tied to mechanics to help the player get levels.</p>\n<p>If we are meant to AFK through the farm (since I imagine this may replace AFK zombie piglin farms mechanics), why do we need an auto-clicker? I dislike the forced use of auto clickers as they are outside resource to properly AFK. Also, to set up this farm we go through all this work to set up a stone generator, piston pushing, auto clicking hoe or light TNT, etc., when we could also just set the auto clicker to swing the sword to kill the mobs for XP. Restricting XP drop on sculk to player-placed TNT is pointless and I hope it is expanded.&nbsp; Besides, it would be annoying if I do kill a mob with my sword, get no XP as it stores itself as sculk, but then perma lose my XP because I didn't know the TNT in dispenser wouldn't drop my XP.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also I suggest adding it to all explosions giving XP, not just TNT, since I imagine TNT dupers will be patched out one day, so it'll be nice to have more fun and creative ways to harvest the XP like ghasts and creepers.</p>",

Players have Handled Chat Moderation on servers since servers could exist just fine. Why should Mojang step in and do it for us if we dont need it.

I think there should be more mobs, like the nether update, and a few new blocks, since the end is pretty bland, so far it only has endstone, obsidian, and a little bit of purper blocks and endstone bricks from end cities. Some mob ideas can be: purper golem, ender warrior, and nuclear zombie. I think the petroleum could be kept, because it is a liquid, and currently there are no natural liquids in the end. A single new biome would probably not be enough, maybe a few can be added. Some block ideas I have are end grass, yellowstone, and voidstone. Maybe the void could be explored by crafting voidstone boots. These voidstone boots will let you jump into the void and doesn't make you die. Instead, you will land on voidstone blocks, and you will be able to explore. They could add a new boss: the void warrior. This boss could have a void sword, that does 15 damage, and would give people the wither effect. This boss will have 250 health points, in between the ender dragon and the wither. The boss could only be summoned by powering a beacon in the void. This will alert the void warrior, and it will challenge you in a fight. The boss could drop its void sword, which when used by you, does 10 damage, a step up from netherite. There also could be new structures in the void and the end, like the void temple and the end building, which holds all of the old and new end mobs. well I am out of space, bye.&nbsp;</p>",

It was thrilling. It was well balanced, because you would not find nearly enough ores to make it possible for that to be your only source. But it was a great moment of excitement, like finding an underground cavern with a chest, etc. That is gone now. The whole \"exposed to air\" thing killed that.</p>\n<p>Some of the bejeweled caverns one would stumble onto while building long underground railways were spectacular. We would leave those unmined for the view when flying by at high speeds. That is gone too. Why? Because someone got a few extra ores without treating Minecraft like a day job?<br><br>In 1.17 and earlier, mining was fun... One could go down to level 11 and have some danger from lava and caves full of monsters, as well as occasional diamonds, gold and enough iron to keep in armor, anvils, and iron golems for villages.<br><br>Now, in order to get enough coal, iron and other minerals to build freely, create, and protect ones self while going out and about, one has to mine at multiple levels. And each level is more boring because there is a lot less to find. This is a real drag in 1.18. Level -54 needs to be reverted to what level 11 used to be.</p>",

This change is terrible for vanilla survival players, there should be a more survival friendly way of changing the radius. Some decent options include a spawn chunks loading toggle included in the world generation options, leaving it as it is right now for old worlds, and having an in game warning when you update to 1.21 that allows you to choose between the old and the new radius, or&nbsp; being able to change it in the menu settings like you do with render distance, which would also allow non-technical players to totally remove them if they will.&nbsp;<br><br>If this change is applied with no further tweaks, a lot of people's builds and farms will be affected and even broken. Many players use the spawn chunks for iron farms, furnace arrays, and keeping many other kinds of contraptions loaded without the need of a chunk loader, which comes with a lot of downsides. And a lot of those players don't want to be forced to resort to altering gamerules to keep their worlds functioning.</p>",

Being able to set that gamerule on the fly is going to make it a lot easier to optimize minigames/maps that have a lobby separate from the levels that players actually play in. For example you can tell Minecraft to un-load stuff at worldspawn (most importantly the entities there) to improve performance when the lobby in some minigame isn't being used. Having lots of entities at worldspawn is a performance drain that a lot of mapmakers overlook. And for SMPs and single-player the small default radius is clearly the right call imo.</p>\n<p>This change will definitely break some maps that were designed with the assumption that spawnChunkRadius was previously 10 (most of my maps... :melting_face:), but fixing this is really easy.</p>\n<p>Some people seem worried that you can only do this with commands, but I assume this will be configurable in the \"create world\" menu which lets you set all the gamerules, which seems good enough to me.</p>",

Also, setting a lockable slide similar to the gamemode changer would be optimal, but only with a range from 2-10 chunks. Any chunk radius higher than 10 chunks (i.e. 11-32) could be accessed with commands. It seems unfair in a way to decrease the old default without giving a way to change it back without using cheats, but keeping chunk radius above 10 as a cheats only setting seems the most fair. Many people don't like to use cheats in their worlds, especially content creators, and would not be able to have as many automatic farms as before.</p>\n<p>Also, thanks for the chance to vote on this.

This way people in singleplayer can edit the gamerule to whatever they want without enabling cheats or editing the nbt data.</p>\n<p>Don't do the thing people suggest about keeping the old spawn chunk range for upgraded worlds, that doesn't make any sense to the average player. All you need to do is let the gamerule menu be accessible from the edit world screen.</p>",

A good idea to attend the subject is: whenever you create a new world an advertisement pops up asking to select the size of the spawnchunks, 1. Default (10x10) “Sacrifices performance for a lot of in-game possibilities!” 2. Small chunks (3x3)  “For players who want a better performance experience”.\n<br />This way you can satisfy every part of the community and give them an option, which will make them feel listened and appreciated, as well as giving them control over their game experience (which is always a good thing).\n</p>",

My suggestion is, if the were world from prior 1.20.5, instead of defaulting the value of generation to 2, it instead mantains the value of spawnChuncks as before, that is, 10. The thing that I aprecciate, though, is that you, as of the current snapshot, you can change this value either with commands or external tools manually and that, when you create the world, you can change the radius of the spawn chunks.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

For villager breeding, iron golem farms, shulker farms etc it is very easy to just build a chunk loader for them. That way you can more easily choose to unload them if they cause performance issues.

I have a post explaining this in more detail, but there are many false bans and is overall just hated. &nbsp;A better method would be:</p>\n<p>1. Require servers to submit their rules to the mod team. If a chat from the server violates the <strong>server’s</strong> chat rules, then it would be reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are no chat rules on a server, people shouldn’t be banned for chatting!</p>\n<p>2. Look at a post’s context. With some form of context, hundreds of false bans would be completely avoidable. Example: If a player were to make a typo of a appropriate word making it inappropriate, and then correct it on the next chat msg, that player should not receive such a hard punishment.</p>\n<p>3. Servers with whitelists should be safe from chat reporting unless the admin wants it.</p>\n<p>4. Joining a server with a mod that tampers with chat (multiple mods disable CR) &nbsp;should have a pop up stating that it could be unsafe. Same with servers that have certain rules disabled.</p>\n<p>5. Tell the player the reason why they were banned and highlight the specific chats that were reported. Keep the reporters anonymous.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

At minimum, the Auth servers should alow for distinguishing between a banned player and an unauthenticated one. If \"offline_mode\" exists, which allows any player to join, even if they do not own the game, a setting to allow legit but banned players to join should not be held back due to \"player safety concerns\" or such.</p>\n<p>As with any reporting system, no matter how hard Mojang tries to make their moderation objective and fair, there will be false bans that slip by their team. Be it an honest mistake by the reviewer, a misunderstanding due to context reasons or something else, such situations will undoubtedly arise. That is why i believe, that there should be a way for such players to continue enjoying your game with their friends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A lack of chat moderation in the game is a problem, but enforcing a global ban list onto privately hosted servers with no way to bypass it is NOT a good solution.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading and please, rethink this Mojang.</p>",

It's an anarchy server where everything goes, players joining implicitly consent to experiencing horrible things. Player reports to Mojang from that server should be implicitly blocked.

By outright banning \"toxic\" players from multiplayer, Mojang is depriving server owners of their right to create a social space of their preference. If a server owner doesn't want/isn't able to moderate their server, they should have the option to let Mojang do so for them. If a server owner want to moderate their own server without interference on Mojang's part, they should be able to allow \"toxic\" player to join if they want to and judge said players by their <em>own</em> rules. It might be nice to let the server owners see why a player was deemed \"toxic\" though, as they may be fine with some toxic behavior but draw the line at others(like espousing pro-genocide propaganda).</p>",

Many players, including those who have played Minecraft for a long time (such as me, playing since 2012) have not encountered any problems with multiplayer that seem to warrant player chat reporting and are not convinced that chat reporting would bring enough benefits to outweigh the downsides.</li>\n<li>You also need to address the concern that adding player chat reporting breaks the promise that migrating would only affect how you log in. Players might fear that you might add more pernicious measures onto Java Edition in the future, such as expanding the scope of chat reporting or sending all chat messages to the moderation team – concerns which you’ll also have to address. It’s unlikely that you’ll be able to allay these concerns at all.</li>\n<li>You should also clarify your stance on game modifications that prevent chat reporting from functioning, as several have been released so far.</li>\n<li>You should also clarify how moderation deals with differences in local laws (most importantly for the “Drugs or Alcohol” category.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also a minor nitpick:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Change the description of “Child sexual exploitation or abuse” from “Someone is talking about or otherwise promoting indecent behavior involving children” to “Someone is <strong>engaging in or promoting</strong>…”.</li>\n</ol>",

I'd say the main problem with it is that there's no way to disable it. A lot of adults/teens play minecraft, and adults/teens like to swear and I think they should be able to, especially if it's a private server that they are literally paying to host.</p>\n\n<p>If the main goal of the word censorship (I refer to keyword blurring that is already on Bedrock edition) is to protect kids, I suggest that the censoring be client side and require the connected Microsoft account's password to be entered in to toggle the setting to off. It lets adults have the freedoms they've had to openly swear in the past, while also keeping kids from seeing that kind of language at the discrepancy of the parent/account owner so the kid can't just turn it off themselves.</p>\n\n<p>As for chat reporting, I do not think chat reporting should exist, but if they really want to put it in. It should allow the server moderators to enable/disable it themselves and have reports go to the owner, not Microsoft/Mojang, unless the server owner chooses for reports to go to Microsoft/Mojang.</p>",

The country from which the report is sent should be sent alongside the report so as to verify through some kind of algorithm that the description contains meaningful words and filter out completely meaningless descriptions.</li>\n<li>There should be a separate option to report chat to server admins. When trying to report chat to global moderators, a message should appear that informs the reporter that behaviour against server rules should be reported to server moderators, while only violations of the Community Standards should be reported to global moderators, prompting players to either proceed with global reporting or report to a server moderator instead.</li>\n<li>A player reporting bad behaviour should check boxes stating that they have read and understood the Minecraft Community Standards and that they acknowledge that abuse of the Chat Report systems may lead to action being taken against their account.</li>\n<li>Action should be taken against abusers, and consequences for abusing should be made clear.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(<a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/7320990094733/comments/7382933186317\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Continues</a>)</p>",

As said many times in this chat, make it toggleable and don’t be like every other corporation who think they can do whatever they want and say ‘it’s for their own good’. This change will only cause people to work around it by creating mods as well as finding exploits to not have to use it.

It will make Minecraft no better than Roblox. </p>\n<p>I will go a bit philosophical here. If you are going to your house you bought with your own money, but the concrete manufacturer kicks you out from the house because they, who do not own your house or pay for your costs, don't like something you said, how would you feel? You wouldn't even have the right to legally do that. Now replace the house with your Minecraft server and the concrete manufacturer with Mojang. Now you can see how global bans (that aren't strictly opt-in and do not allow the user to access servers which have it disabled) could be illegal. You don't own the servers, so you can't legally keep people from accessing them.</p>",

People wanna play it as they want, some parts of the language used is required, even if it's some kind of harassment since there are reasons that you cannot deduct only on the chat, some kind of third party actions like cheating or building profanities as well as voice chat while not using microphone, only listening. Thing you are doing there is limiting the usage of minecraft chat and making people use external communicators, making it worse for people that want to stay anonymous as well as younger audience. Most of servers have already some kind of moderation but they leave some part of freedom. Limiting the freedom of speech, even if it's about theoretically bad things, limits also the ability to make all known \"dark jokes\" on public servers while those are dedicated for older audience. It's better to make people conscious about those things than limit speech. Some people use minecraft as a way to calm themselves so they need more freedom in such times while playing online. Giving them ban to all the online services, even if those accept that behavior, like private servers for small groups, makes f.e. suicidal people more distressed, what can lead to diverse things. You have to remember that games are for every age group so you shouldn't limit them</p>",

This feature could also be abused to ban many people, like myself, and I am on my servers quite a bit, someone could join wanting to troll and report me over and over for no reason. I don't entirely know how the report system works but if it is anything like bedrock where people can get banned for literally nothing, this this would be a horrible feature. I give it a few months after this update releases and all the major youtubers will be banned, many server owners, server admins, and maybe even some of your own staff.</p>",

There will be no doubt to my mind that many innocent players will be chased away from the game due to report abuse that will no doubt happen. Similar to the abuse to the Report system on youtube where whole channels can be trashed because too many folks reported a video or set of vids that had no problems in them. The minecraft community will probably thin quite a bit as those that get banned for poor reasons will move to other services or eventually make a new minecraft clone, and take their fans with them. Like the community did to blizzard making private servers of WoW and warcraft to spite Blizzards efforts of things happening on the main servers. So again please stop the policing actions that the various server admins can handle themselves without help or oversight from a council that is not involved in said game session and has no knowledge to the events in said session.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Overall this feels like it goes against the game's culture and design, Minecraft has historically has put emphasis on the open nature of it (run your own servers, modding is encouraged, hell even make client side cheats). Again, I like the idea of chat moderation, but it's not really an issue to begin with, and the system goes against the nature of the game and especially the community. At best this should be exclusive to realms or be heavily dialed back (especially with the system effectively punishing anyone attempting to opt out of it and each pre-release making the process even more difficult). I understand this is being done in good faith and the team wants the best for the community but this seems to be a solution in search of a problem.</p>",

If you really want this in the game so bad, please actually consider reworking this system with the small changes the community has been so vocal about.

I've been admin on a server for many years and whatever problems we had were dealt with by a group of competent adults. Bans, temp bans and appeals were voted on to ensure maximum fairness. We fostered a strong, happy community. We took the time to thoroughly deal with all problems and respected our diverse group of players.

It is a vast online universe with more wonders than Earth itself. You'll find the good and bad in Minecraft. But there is a lot more good than bad. As said before, it's because of the dedicated moderators. They in themselves are a strong community. It's the same principle as open source software. Why is it better? Why is Linux the best operating system? Because dedicated enthusiasts commit personal time to work together to release a stellar product. Minecraft is the product of it's community.

Make it toggleable on private servers.</p>\n<p>2. Give the administrators/owners of a server the option to give a recommended age range, such as 10+, 13+, 16+ 18+ etc. In practice the 18+ servers would rely on their own mechanisms to detect, ban and otherwise punish members who are not abiding by the servers rules. On 10+ and 13+ servers the chat reporting would be possible and required in case someone clearly breaks the TOS of Microsoft. And on the 16+, where the lines are often blurred, the chat reporting feature would be recommended, but ultimately left to the server owners.</p>\n<p>3. Simply never implement the feature seeing how false bans can often be common in these situations, especially if the context is not fully given. This could happen within a small community who are very comfortable with each other, and who can say certain slurs of communities they belong to (such as the LGBTQ community). If these are all not fully taken into consideration then the system is faulty.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Seeing Microsofts response to the backlash of this feature I would not be surprised if they implement it anyways and watch the game die, but one can only hope they do the right thing by the community.</p>",

Thousands of reports would be streaming in each day, most of them being from people who want to mess with the system. Also, ever since Minecraft multiplayer was instituted, servers have done an amazing job of moderating themselves, stating the guidelines for their servers, and disallowing anyone who refuses to abide by the rules to play on the server. Each server differs in content, goals, and players. There is no \"one size fits all\" method to moderate the conduct of the massive Minecraft community. Some servers might want to be kid-friendly, and have warnings for people who swear or use untoward language in chat. Others might adopt an \"anything goes\" policy. The way to solve the problem is to allow people to continue to self-moderate and take care of themselves. After all, Minecraft is a game where you can do anything you can dream of, and no one is excluded. I don't know what Microsoft wants with this new chat report system, but I am positive that it is a terrible idea.</p>",

Being banned from individual servers isn't the end of the world; you can always hop on another server to play. The ability to report players to a non-server-based moderator to review their chat messages and decide whether or not to permanently ban them is, honestly, so detrimental to the experience as to be considered game-breaking. If this is implemented, this WILL kill Minecraft. Please, do not do this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, on a side-note, I find the fact that you can report someone for self-harm/su*c*de related messages incredibly disturbing. As someone who has been helped through some extremely tough times and someone who has helped others through similar circumstances while on private servers, I am appalled that even a mention of these topics could result in a ban. Banning these topics would not help individuals struggling with mental health. It would actively hurt us by removing our social support.&nbsp;</p>",

Minecraft Servers hosted by people can deal with the chat moderation just as well if not better than Mojang/Microsoft’s chat moderation.</p>\n<p>B. Yes; chat reporting is sorta a thing in Minecraft: *Bedrock Edition*, but the system is too flawed there. If the feature does get implemented anyways, then moderation on Minecraft: *Bedrock Edition* needs a lot of changing up.</p>\n<p>C. The Community. The Community doesn’t like the changes, and I am fairly certain a 12 yr. kid knows how bad this feature would bring to Minecraft.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>D. There does need to be a level of moderation, but chat reporting isn’t the way to go. There could be better ways to go about moderation; like parental controls and server owners having a rating from 0 (kid friendly) to 10 (not kid friendly) or something along those lines.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>E. You don’t need to be “banned” off Minecraft: *Java Edition* if you made one bad decision. Maybe a chat mute by Mojang/Microsoft on servers/realms, and, if continued, a temp ban, and then a perm ban.</p>",

And, judging by the problems that Bedrock has with chat reporting, it's impossible and impractical to moderate it long term.

I've played Minecraft for about 10 years now, since I was a kid. Mostly, I would play on multiplayer servers, though a fair amount of my time was on singleplayer as well. On all the communities I went into, which were mostly major ones like Hypixel, Cubecraft, the Hive (RIP), and even Mineplex for a short bit, each one had a strong moderation system that allowed all players to feel safe in their environment, and that to a reasonable extent, the moderation was swift and fair. I see no reason for Mojang to have to waste time and budget to work through extensive moderation on millions upon millions of players, most of whom who do break the guidelines are most likely to be the ones capable of evading punishment to begin with.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If it's a must, and you really have to moderate every server in Minecraft from now on, at least do it right. Many people in the community have pointed out countless flaws with this system, and while no moderation system will be perfect, there should never be \"False flags\" when it's unlikely the victim will receive timely support in the first place. The system should not distribute punishment&nbsp;<strong>ever</strong> to innocent players. It's an act that will give infamy to moderation for years to come. My greatest hope is this gets reverted and never reintroduced.</p>",

The only problem- it's buggy and implemented the wrong way. Trying to say the word \"night\" doesn't work because the report system uses a lazy system to prevent the *n* word by banning the phrase \"nig\". And also, what if adults playing this game wish to say cuss words in chat? Minecraft has an audience of more than just 6-year olds. And why is it so easy to avoid the restrictions? It should at least work upon implementation, right? And why implement it now, when servers and realms have already come up with their own solutions to this problem that are better than a coded report system? Moderators exist for a reason. I feel this report system is fine but is just going to be a hassle to avoid in the future. The reasons for it being there don't outweigh the drawbacks.</p>",

It really seems like to me that it should only apply to first-party servers and the same tools should be released for third-party servers to use if they so choose. Like if someone bullies someone else on my private server, then the chat report should go to my email so I can decide if the player should be banned from specifically my server. Or for those that want players moderated, but don't want to do it themselves, giving a server option to opted into the global ban system. Players connecting to servers that have opted out could be given a warning about how the server allows unmoderated players to join.</p>\n<p>I feel like one of the reasons they are doing it the way that they are though is because they either haven't thought of or don't want to be deal with adding proper parental controls. If they added parental controls along with the chat reporting changes I mentioned, then they could do something like add a control on accounts to disable access to servers that have not opted into the global ban system. That way, anarchy servers could continue to run the way they currently do, and parents could have the peace of mind that their kids can't accidentally join one.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I run an Minecraft Java Building Server, thats been up since 2015 all members are adults.This type of server depends on the community being able to communicate with each other, to join in making beautiful megabuilds. We have strict rules about all the things you're implementing, but infractions are rare. Our players have always used chat without fear of losing Minecraft entirely. Now they are talking about disabling their own chat. This breaks communication, community cooperation,and even keeps Server Owners from communicating with them should there be a suspected problem, such as cheating, because they don't send or receive Chat at all!&nbsp; They might as well be playing Single Player. It is breaking our community, they fear, they may be taken out of context, mis-type a word or accidentally hit that Caps Lock without realizing it and be banned. We had a member with a neurological disability, who often mis-types due to hand tremors. She has already quit the game that freed her from her disability, a few hours each day, for fear she would be banned for all Caps &amp; mis-spelling (which isn't offensive, just difficult to decipher)&nbsp; Everyone says they're not offended by her sometimes unreadable chat, but someone new could misunderstand. Does this qualify as decriminalization against someone with a disability?&nbsp; Intended or not, it already did just that! Please let us private server owners choose to enable this or not.</p>",

Better: The Players could be automaticly be muted if they broke the rules, so every player can decide on there own, to read the messages from the player or not.&nbsp;<br><br>The best opinion you have is: let it be! Minecraft isn't a game that have to be moderated by offical moderators. <strong>Since 2011 this game didn't need this feature and it still won't need that!</strong><br><br>SO JUST LET IT BE!<br><br>2. option<br>Do it but don't take the choice of the Server Owners who can join on there server!

What if there was a ban suggestion for a particular person and you could choose to ignore it or provide your side of the story on a particular chat message that the creator of the community report selected.

It's also insane how easily the context of reports can be altered, by deleting messages sent by the reported or by even adding new noes to alter context. And for Mojang to just ignore these major exploits, that will definitely be abused, is uneatable, further more, from a security standpoint it's insane that Mojang choose to simply store your private key in plain text, this is madness! And if this system would have been implemented with global chat mutes, it would even be understandable, but banning someone from playing a game, cuz they said \"bad\" things in chat is nonsensical and obscene (that's if you even got fairly banned). So in summary, Mojang added an unsafe, exploitable and highly uncalled fore system in to Minecraft, with seemingly no consideration on how this affects the whole community. Because of that i will no longer recommend Minecraft to my friend, since it's now an unsafe space in which you could be undeservingly punished and there's nothing you can do about it, since even if you apile the bann, Mojang can't do anything if the context got altered. And for the people how already have Minecraft... DON'T update to 1.19.1 and if you must, then play with a mod like No Chat Reporting.</p>",

People will use it as a way to ban people that are too good or like to gloat. It's a way to bring fans away from Minecraft.

I remember when I went on servers back in 2013-2014, and yes, there was language that this filter would probably not like, but servers moderate themselves well, and there was never anything egregiously wrong. I think that this heavy-handed approach is the wrong way to create a safe environment. Should a game that is optional for children to play, or for their parents to let them play, be overly moderated due to the concerns of that few, or the concerns of the many? I also do want to mention my dismay at the about face your company enacted; after saying that there would be <em>no&nbsp;</em>changes to Java with account migration, you have gone back on your word and betrayed an old and faithful community. Your attempts to stick your heads in the sand are, I think, even more telling. You know that this is wrong, and that it will only hurt your most dedicated fans. I join the chorus of voices asking for this policy to be ended, and for Minecraft to be what it once was, a place where, \"No one can tell you what you can or can not do\".</p>",

Servers created by these users have chat-reporting on by default. Mojang will take action against servers/players breaking chat-regulations. If you are willing to harbor users under the age of 18; then YOU MUST be willing to moderate, asses, and take action for and/or against these servers/players WITH A REAL HUMAN BEING. Obviously if someone lies about their age, they are breaking EULA, respective action will be taken against user/servers, and reported to their local authorities if necessary.</li>\n<li>Users who are ages 18+ can create/join 18+ private/public servers &amp; can join 13-17 age grouped public/private servers. If a user has a certain suspension(Determined by manual review of chat-reporting system); they can only join 18+ temporarily/permanently &amp;/or can no longer join servers online that support chat-reporting. These users have the option to create/join private servers without the chat-reporting system toggled on.</li>\n<li>Servers within one of the two defined age groups &amp; servers that are opting in/out of the chat-reporting system will be assigned with an appropriate icon and display a disclosure agreement screen; each respective to their nature.</li>\n</ol>",

Its a bad idea as server owners should be in power of can and can't happen in there server, you can go ahead and ruin realms as it runs off your servers but you should not have any control of other peoples servers because, you are not the one who pays for it to run, you are not going to have context on what the server is, and you'll end up banning people for no reason. If you power hungry company doesn't want to fully remove it just make it an option for the server owner to enable or disable the chat report system instead of scamming people by taking away the thing that they purchased real money for, tbh this ban system should be illegal because you're stealing peoples money. </p>",

You could use it when mining, or even in the End, to reach cheeky shulkers who teleport to the bottom of the structure.</em></p>\n<p><em>You should be able to throw them, similar to how a trident works, but you should have to manually break it like a minecart, so that you can leave it for another player or whatever. The rope should stay in the players hand until they drop it with q, at which point the rope would dangle until it ran out of length or hit the floor. The rope should be climbable like vines or ladders.\"<br><br><br></em>I'd prefer if the Grapple hook was a Grapple Pick, one that can be used to sling towards a destination that's at max 20 blocks away, It could help with some sticky situations, Including If the warden began chasing you (Unless It could counter this in some way.) The grappling hook was originally used in naval warfare to catch ship rigging so that it could be boarded back in the roman ages, So I don't see how It would be too modern, especially if It were just a pickaxe attached to an extended lead.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

They should make a new thing tho where some enchantments raise the cost of others. If I had feather falling, and added depth strider, it would cost more levels.
