To use it you would have to stand still while teleporting and it could take 30 seconds with obvious particle animation and sound to alert people and mobs around you where you are and that you are teleporting. It could use up the item or use a large part of its durability that can't be repaired, also maybe to craft/use it the map used would have to be of your spawn area, so if your spawn has changed you would have to craft/combine it with a map of your new spawn.</p>\n<p>But I don't know may be still to OP, if anything this could be a good idea for a item in a vanilla + or more likely a vanilla adjacent mod.</p>",

I've run into a stronghold that spawned on top of a mine shaft and a dripstone cave, and the jumbled up mess made it a pain to navigate, and while it is cool that some structures can render on top of each other, I think the stronghold should be made an exception, as it is the entrance to and set up for the End.</p>\n<p>Mob spawning is bugged as well, but more on the side of not enough spawns instead of something like the new light rules suddenly going out the window. Mobs have refused to spawn on blocks I actually placed down, like for a mob farm, and meanwhile the spawner blocks are constantly cranking out enemies regardless of light level. I had to place torches on every block near the spawner just to interrupt the spawn pattern.</p>\n<p>And in regards to the original post on this thread, yes, rivers tend to more often than not just be flooded caves open to the air, which makes them a breeding ground for drowned.
