A phantom boss could be found in large areas without mobs.\n<br /> It would create storms with wind that slows down the player. Due to the dust raised by the wind and the rain the player would not be able to see around him and the boss would be illuminated by random lightnings. The boss could attack with very loud screams and cause negative effects by looking at the player with its eyes for a few seconds. When it reaches a low standard of living, it would call some normal phantoms to help it, they will be able to see even in the dust.\n<br />The Phantom boss would be a giant phantom with more details on the wings, including veins as green as its eyes. Being injured its wings would tear and spots of green blood would appear on its body.\n<br />Defeating it would drop many levels of experience, phantom membrane and a pupil of its eyes, which can be used to create a device to see very far away, even at night and underwater. A kind of telescope.</p>",
