There's a 1 in 10 chance an illager that's the type the evil villager turned into will not attack when he sees you. Instead he'll say, \"Wait, is that you, [player name here]?\" Then he says, \"IT'S PAYBACK TIME!!!!!!!!!!!\" Then he starts attacking with attacks that deal more damage than usual. He also has a health bar. Once you defeat him, he explodes. He drops whatever what his illager type would normally drop.
