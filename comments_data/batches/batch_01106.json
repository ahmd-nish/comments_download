Java is just way easier to work with when it comes to custom modifications. You can see this just by looking at communities like Forge or Spigot. Having the minecraft server ported to C++ would destroy thousands of modifications and probably millions of manhours that several communities put into the game. Also C++ is not \"way faster\" per se. The latest JVM is capable of matching the performance of C++ after a bit of runtime and some JIT compilation in some places.</p>",

You never forget that you need wood first before getting deep into the game. I think this sgould be tweeked so that the player doesent lose it from wither effect or fall damage or even poison. It would be better if they only lost it after dying. If its hard to obtane it should be difficult to lose. Like makeing a fire aspect sward. The only ways to actualy lose it arebif it breaks or if one looses it to lava, fire, or despawning from the timer.</p>",

The pocket dimension would only be open for 12 in-game days, upon entering a player would hear gongs ringing off how many days are left (and a text notice), also at midnight the gong would sound off to let players know how much longer they have. On Hardcore and Hard failure to leave before the time end means you are tossed to the void, for Normal and Easy you are teleported to the gateway in the overworld.
