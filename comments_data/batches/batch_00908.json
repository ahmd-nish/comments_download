The variable would control the size of the mob's hitbox, attack reach, jump height, model size, and so forth. Mobs would naturally spawn with a random size (within a certain range, depending on the mob). Size could also have a slight effect how much damage the mob naturally does, or how much health it naturally has.</p>\n<p>In addition to this feature, maybe there could be two new Effects (and potions?): Shrink and Grow. Shrink would change the mob's entityScale to half for the duration of the effect, and Grow would change the mob's entityScale to 1.5 times for the duration of the effect. This could also work on the player!</p>",

Would be great. So much time goes to waste because of this limit. But if you do remove it, please introduce some ways that will prevent us from messing up our worlds. I occasionally make a few mistakes, like deleting or adding a number to the coordinates by mistake, or I mark the wrong locations. As a result, I've gotten into a habit of using the \" replace &lt;block&gt;\" argument. An /undo and /redo would be great, that would affect /fill, /setblock and /clone executed by the given player; command blocks are exempt. Other than that, removing the limit altogether is a recipe for disaster, however, increasing it by up to 16 times would be useful. Perhaps a \"/yes &lt;number&gt;\" to confirm the command if the area is over a certain size.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Oh, and if you do implement /redo and /undo, please save the last 1-2 actions to the disk, in case the game would crash inbetween.</p>",
