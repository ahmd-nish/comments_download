And It should be able to be crafted/cut into the Tuff bricks, Tuff brick stairs, Tuff brick wall, and Tuff brick slabs. And all of the Tuff variants should be able to be polished (Polished Tuff bricks/ Polished tuff). Another great idea for Tuff is that it could possibly be used to make stronger pistons as well, The \"Tuff pistons\" could be used to push more blocks (credit for ''Tuff piston'' idea goes to Mumbo jumbo). I think that the tuff block has a lot of potential so please tell me what you think, Thank you.&nbsp;</p>",

But there could be other useful things to trade with. What if Lumberjacks could sell wood carvings of MC mobs? That would be really cool. That's the only way you would get them. Lumberjacks are more experienced with wood than the others, so they could have custom wood items like that. And since you can't un-craft wood items, maybe trading emeralds would give you a lot more fences, slabs, &amp; stairs than you would get with trading normal wood. Maybe you would get a stack and a half of fences or slabs for an emerald. Yes that's cheap, but so is wood itself. Anything lower than that might not be worth trading with.</p>",

I would love to see a Lumberjack villager too! maybe he could trade stuff like sticks for emeralds like the fletcher but have another chance to trade saplings for emerald too I mean every lumberjack needs to repopulate the cutdown trees right? In addition to those you could trade him emeralds for axes much like the weapon smith and maybe iron for emeralds? then in return these lumberjacks will be biome dependant too so they will have wood trades depending on the biomes they are closest too so for instance a spruce village next to a roofed forest and birch forest could have trades like birch logs for emeralds or even spruce logs for emeralds!</p>",

Maybe Tuff?</p>\n<p>Please, do NOT make pointed dripstone 3D lol, it looks awesome as it is. I do have to agree with it not blending in however. Unless dripstone caves are going to be lined with the blocks, I would prefer to see variants of pointed dripstone that match the stone type it is growing out of. At least just stone stalagmites and stalactites. Perhaps we could craft pointed dripstone out of stone type blocks, allowing us to terraform as we see fit, so you dont have to program them into the generation? I know Id love to see blackstone ones for the nether.</p>\n<p>I would decrease the cauldron fill time too, I really dont see the harm in being able to gather lots of obsidian or having a good source of fuel for a furnace, it all takes work to set up anyway. Players are going to need their coal for spelunking now so itll be great to have a robust fuel source available.</p>\n<p>I also second adding dripstone to underwater caves, it would look SO good in an already incredible update.</p>",

A lot of nostalgia addicts dont like the new Pointed Dripstone but I feel it is a welcome change to non block items. Plants not being a cube is why people love them in their builds so much. These new items break up the rigidity and symmetry of the caves and gives them a richer texture as you explore them. They also provide us with renewable water and lava, theyre amazing to say the least. I dont know how you would do it, but I would LOVE to see some variations of the Pointed Dripstone shapes. Long, thin ones and fat stout ones. Smaller thin ones would look great in smaller, narrower caves and the stout ones would fit in the large caverns and dripstone biome, to kind of break up the repetition. Ive wanted these since i started playing in 2013 and im so close now lol. Maybe they could spread from a growing stalagmite/stalactite as an incidental thing, and they stay when you break the main Pointed Dripstone? And the stout ones can be formed by clustering Pointed Dripstone in certain configurations (2x2, 1x2)?</p>",

Calcite should get stairs, slabs, and walls; and there should be a brick variant of these as well. Smooth basalt would look nice with stair, slab, wall, and brick variants, but since it's not unique to geodes that isn't as important. Finally, regular amethyst should have slab and stair variants. It should have a smooth variant (with slabs and stairs), and a smooth bricks variant (also with slabs and stairs). An amethyst column or chiseled amethyst block would also be great.</p>\n<p>-I love the idea of incredibly rare geodes that are five or six times the size. They would make for an incredible find.</p>\n<p>-Calcite, being both the most-sought-after and hardest-to-find block of the update, should get a crafting recipe. I think a recipe similar to diorite's, with amethyst shards replacing the quartz, would be nice.</p>\n<p>-Naturally, amethyst needs more crafting recipes, but I'd expect those would come later down the road, and I'm fine with that.</p>",

For as common and as nearly limitless as they are, they really only serve to fill up inventory space.</p>\n<p>Here are some of my suggestions to improve the usability of amethyst:</p>\n<p>- A Laser. Not the *pew-pew* kind, but the kind of lasers that act like tripwires or can relay redstone signals and can be used over very long distances with no delay to them. This may be a late-game item you'd craft using quartz / prismarine, redstone, and of course amethyst.</p>\n<p>- Crafting together diamonds, emeralds, and amethyst shards with gold nuggets all across the top can make Jewelry which can be sold to villagers for a <strong>hefty</strong> return of emeralds.</p>\n<p>- Like <em>DarkStalkerMoon</em>&nbsp;mentioned, Crystal Daggers/Knives would be an interesting use for amethyst shards. It would also be neat if these daggers/knives can be tipped with certain potion effects like arrows are. Maybe have this feature available only at the fletching table...?</p>\n<p>- Maybe generate Cave Villages under mountains that can trade amethyst for emeralds and whatnot. Or, maybe, add a new villager profession \"<strong>The&nbsp;</strong><strong>Prospector</strong>\" that can trade amethyst and other mining related items for emeralds.</p>\n<p>The list can go on and on, but there can be a multitude of uses for amethyst other than what's already there.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Here's my criticism of the item: Amethyst is borderline useless. It's incredibly niché, I doubt people are going to find a geode and be like \"Woow a super rare geod, now I can make cool black glass\". Here are just some random ideas of what I would do with Amethyst:</p>\n<p>A redstone component that reacts depending on the weather?</p>\n<p>What about an Amethyst crystal block that will absorb the light level that it is exposed to forever? (similar to how magma blocks once worked)</p>\n<p>What about a potion made from amethyst power (formed when an anvil drops on an amethyst block) that can give the player an \"amethystic\" aura ability to scare off light intolerant mobs? (Like zombies)</p>\n<p>What about being able to add some Amythests to boots with the Smithing table, which would grant those boots 1 (and only 1) safe fall from any height, the addon would break after and the player would have to add it again. It doesn't make SENSE but it gives the item some use that inspired enthusiasm and excitement when we find a geode.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Amethyst is a crystal, so much what it could do might be related to light, and obviously the suggestions above are just random ideas that I put&nbsp;<strong>10 seconds of thought into</strong> so please don't assume these are serious suggestions, just ideas, intrinsic reasons to be excited when you find a geode, giving it uses and making it worth the dangerous trip of finding them.</p>",

It is also not an item people want to grab because it does not contribute to anything unlike Redstone which is the electricity system of the game, emeralds which is used for trading and lapis which is used for enchanting. Amethyst has no use in the game and should contribute to one of Minecraft's core mechanics so players would want to go out and mine it. Whether it be fishing, the fletchers table, the smithing table or a brand new system in the next update, just give it a somewhat useful reason to grab. The only useful thing amethyst can be used for in my opinion is tinted glass, but even then I don't really use that item.
