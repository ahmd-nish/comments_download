Instead of a pulley, i was more into the idea of a conveyor belt because it is a bit more expensive and is not like a rope and pulley that would presumably only need iron and string. Also I too had the idea of a gear to redstone and redstone to gear contraption and I already made some concept art for it.&nbsp;Well i hope our idea gets approved!&nbsp;</p>",

If you're designing something in creative to be copied and distributed, then you design it without dust, or with very limited dust, and you <strong>certainly</strong> don't rely on dust update order, this simply allows you to do something safely, that was previously considered \"bad practice\", which I am all for. That being said there are parts of these changes which are currently bad, such as only sending updates through solid blocks, but that is not the bulk of the changes, and as far as I can tell, not the intention, overall I think this change doesn't break nearly as much as people think it does, I do invite you to try and find good examples of things this breaks, which weren't already broken if you copied them to a new location</p>",

Other components like observers, repeaters… send block updates regardless of surrounding blocks. Restricting this to dust alone will confuse players. Consistency is crucial, and this change disrupts that.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Non-Deterministic Order:</strong> Randomizing the order when \"there is not enough context to fully determine the order\" adds more inconsistency. Components like rails behave directionally deterministically. Dust deviates from this, becoming unpredictable (way more than before for some scenarios). This inconsistency is problematic for players designing complex contraptions. For consistency, dust should follow the same deterministic block update order as other components.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Misunderstanding the Root Cause of Lag:</strong> While optimizing code helps, the issue isn’t just block updates but how dust lines behave when depowered at high signal strengths. When a 15-long dust line powered by SS15 loses power, it triggers a cascading search, causing multiple ticks (up to 7) for each wire. The problem lies in this repeated ticking, not just block updates. In fact, dust sends only 8 more updates than inclined rails and the same as redstone torches.</li>\n</ul>",

Because the new redstone dust update order already checks where it got power from for update order, you can use this existing check to not schedule duplicate updates already covered by previous redstone dust.

It would definitely take some time to get used to, but I could be in favor of this change. Overall I'm neutral on this change.</p>\n<p>\"Before a line of wire causes block updates, the new signal strength of all connected wires is set\":<br>This will make redstone dust depowering order actually possible to solve and rely on, and I can't think of any existing contraptions that would break because of this change being implemented. It should also significantly decrease the amount of block updates that are processed when a redstone line depowers, reducing overall lag. Very good change, I definitely think this one should stay regardless of whether the other features stay.</p>\n<p>\"When a line of wire turns on or off, the wires closer to the power source will cause block updates first\":<br>Similar to the first change, I see advantages and disadvantages. I would prefer more of a depth-first order rather than breadth-first but I could ultimately settle for breadth-first. I'm between Neutral and negative on this change.<br><br>\"When two wires have the same distance to the power source, which of them causes updates first is picked at random\":<br>Absolutely not. Please just pick a direction and stick with it. This change should NEVER make it out of snapshots. Lack of randomness is one of the major reasons I play java instead of bedrock.<br><br>\"The order in which blocks around the wire update is based on the direction the wire received an update from\":<br>This is acceptable. I still prefer the order to be directional instead of this, but I can understand that removing this aspect of directionality can be better for the ecosystem. Other redstone components are still directional though, so I think many larger contraptions would still be directional even if this change was instituted.<br><br>\"Currently, the order is: back, front, left, right, down, up where left and right may be swapped depending on the random choice made by the line of wire\":<br>Get rid of the random choice of course, but otherwise this order is fine. Although I would prefer up/down between back/front and left/right because sometimes you just need vertical block updates before or after the horizontal block updates.<br><br>\"When the updates are further distributed through solid blocks, the same order is applied there\":<br>This is fine, but similar to my thoughts on the first change, I'm not convinced further block updates should be restricted to only going through solid blocks.</p>",

Adding randomness to Redstone dust at all but ruin anything using Redstone dust. The change of Redstone only causing block updates to blocks that can receive power would massacre anything that utilizes block updates in any capacity. Redstone may have its flaws and be somewhat \"janky\" but it is well known how those quirks work and how to use them they might function oddly but they are consistent in the way that they work. Please don't destroy the technical Minecraft community by even thinking about changes like this years and years of progress and research and your community creating things would be ruined and destroyed.</p>",

The introduction of random mechanics could severely impact all systems and contraptions that depend on update order. These new random mechanics remind me of the Bedrock version, which, in my experience, is not ideal for Technical Minecraft due to its erratic and unreliable nature. What we truly value in Minecraft Java is its consistency.</p>\n<p>Entire communities, such as those focused on Doors and 0-tick generators, rely on the predictable functioning of redstone. Many encoding mechanics based on dust could be disrupted if we can no longer reliably control the order in which they activate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is quite serious, and these changes should not be made merely to resemble the Bedrock version.&nbsp;<br>Bedrock requires significant adjustments to redstone, and Minecraft Java has maintained a consistent and efficient redstone system since version 1.5. Even if you think this system is outdated or problematic, perhaps optimizing the code, similar to how Sodium does it, without altering the functionality of any components, could be considered...</p>\n</blockquote>",

But I think we could have our cake and eat it too.</p>\n<p>1) How about creating a new redstone connector with redstone and copper? Redstone dust would retain quasi-connectivity and the new copper wire would only update blocks it is directly connected to. Both wire types would not connect to or cross over the other.</p>\n<p>2) Likewise, it could operate on a principle of 'one input, one output\" like a true electric circuit. Therefore the copper wire can't 'turn into itself' like dust can. If players are only working with one wire at a time, then adjacency to the power source determining update order might not cause as many headaches.</p>\n<p>3) Randomness is not a solution, but I think if the goal is to make the redstone rules more clear then it is step in the right direction. I'd personally make it possible to more precisely time wire updates and delays so randomness, while present, never becomes a factor. There at least needs to be some way to choose which component you want to trigger.</p>",

In my eyes, it has a few flaws though: the order of block updates, and the randomness for ambiguous cases.</p>\n<p>Block updates are emitted only after all the power changes have been carried out. While this generally makes sure the evaluator is not interrupted in the middle of carrying out power changes, It also risks breaking e.g. very basic 0-tick generators. I suspect this is partially why wires no longer update not-connected adjacent blocks, which comes at the cost of breaking other circuits instead. A proper fix would integrate block updates into the update queue, this would keep the update order the same but ensure some parity with previous versions. But this is not feasible without circumventing the new neighbor updater system introduced in 1.19. Another solution is to emit block updates in the reverse order in which wires are updated. But that then detracts from the intuitiveness of the new system. Both solutions have a cost and I am not sure what the best route to take is (and other solutions can yet be explored).</p>",

You even released a version patching this issue again. I just hope this time you listen to us, as what we really want is to see improvements, not regressions. I remember how the copper bulb mechanic, which started off well, was changed, and after receiving technical community feedback that was not heeded, nothing was done, and this component is no longer as exciting as when it was first introduced</p>\n<p>Instead of altering the behavior of redstone dust, perhaps you should revert the copper bulb original behavior to operate at 1gt</p>\n<p>I am confident that you can improve performance without compromising existing mechanics. I trust you will make a decision that benefits the entire community. Many people use these mechanics to build farms, and not everyone is a redstone expert.

This behavior is used extensively and a majority of breakages in this snapshot will be caused by this change.</p>\n<p>Luckily there is a fairly simple solution: for every block update emitted to a side of or below a wire, also emit a block update to the block below that. This ensures that every block within a range of 2 that is QC-powered by a wire will be updated, which is what happens in 1.21.1 and below as well.</p>\n<p>Issue 2. is smaller, though still not desirable.

It is true that a lot of contraptions would break, but throughout the history of the game plenty of changes have been made that have broken some contraptions and it's been fine. People are averse to change, but after a while you learn the new system and you get used to it.</p>\n<p>Locationality is the worst mechanic in the game, so I'd love to see it go. The update order change is so so good. I'm also onboard for reducing the amount of updates from dust. However, I do think that dust should update the blocks adjacent to it, even if it's not powering that block.</p>\n<p>On the introduced randomness, I understand why randomness is disliked. However I feel that people are overlooking the fact that it's not always random, only the 'edge cases' are random. That means that the randomness is trivial to avoid, just make sure everything powered is at different distances from the source. Not to mention that randomness also has its place. There are plenty of contraptions dedicated to creating random results, because sometimes that's useful.</p>\n<p>To conclude, I think it was the right decision for these changes to be experimental and I think it's wonderful that you're taking feedback. I also think most of the negativity just comes from the fact that people dislike change. All in all I believe the changes have lots of potential, great work!</p>",

This new change adds no new capabilities to redstone, because there already is a block in the game that can compare signal strength: the comparator!

We already have plenty of ways to generate randomness and really i prefer a system that is locational and directional over one that goes out of the source its activated from (and even that isnt consisten, you didnt even make the consistency consistent). Just know that if you keep ignoring the redstone playerbase as you have done with the copper bulb changes that there will be a HUGE uproar. While redstone is the main reason for lag on big servers, how about improving the server jar to just be more efficient overall with things like entity culling. Take a look at what some of the server optimization mods do. You've taken inspiration from mods before like with pistons and horses for example. I think it would be a huge honor for the modders that made sodium and lithium for example to assist you in making the overall playerbase like the game more. Not just cater to one specific part of the playerbase (in this case less redstone-savvy players). Listen to your community and accept their help when needed. A game isnt only shaped by it's creators but by their community as a whole. For example games like TF2 and Geometry Dash. These games and minecraft wouldnt be where they are right now with their huge connected communities, all uniting to make the game they play better for themselves and others. If you are reading this, please help us make the subcommunities in minecraft better.&lt;3</p>",

Just replace all that weird game design with blocks that allow the same or even better behavior like u did with the observer.

The change to the Redstone Torch texture isn't something I had thought about or wanted before, but I do like the change, but I would prefer if the inside were a bright red, maybe with a little bit of white or orange and the outside were a slightly darker red. I think that would look better than the current version, the white inside looks a bit odd to me. The redstone dust changes don't relate to Bedrock edition as bedrock edition doesn't use block updates for its redstone system in the first place, one of the reasons it has randomness. The only bits of randomness in Bedrock redstone that are problematic for me are in cases where one piston is finishing movement at the same time that another one is starting movement. There is a feedback suggestion that would fix those cases for Bedrock edition that I support and have voted for: <a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360060221652-Pistons-should-finish-moving-blocks-before-other-pistons-start-bedrock\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pistons should finish moving blocks before other pistons start [bedrock]</a> The complaints about the randomness in Java edition I find strange as those cases are very rare where that occurs.</p>",

The redstone community would much rather have redstone wire update all blocks as it used to be instead of rebuilding many contraptions to gain a tiny performance increase.

An example is that redstone decides where it does or doesn't connect; this could easily be fixed by allowing the player to decide. For example, if there is a piston and an adjacent redstone dust to the side of it, the player would be able to click, hold, and drag the dust directly into the piston, which would literally make the circuit eight times smaller than looping the dust around like an airplane makes a 180 degree turn. Another restriction of redstone is that most of its components are not mobile, meaning they cannot be pushed by pistons. Flying machines would be so much easier with mobile redstone, because the player could stop it simply by stepping off a pressure plate. The parameters of redstone could be easily be expanded if these simple changes were made.</p>",

Maybe it can give off a light level of maybe 7 or 8 or maybe the light level is dependant on a signal strenght (so its light level can be 8 normally, but 10 if powered by a redstone block). This is a stretch, but what if all redstone in the lanterns light range is powered based on the light level it is in which is tied to signal strength. Also it can just be aesthetic (for horror builds idk)</p>",

Powering it from underneath or from the side seems slightly impractical for normal use seeing as it would be used as a decorative block, however, making it possible for the redstone lantern to be toggled would allow it to function like a night light in a room or have a use like a normal redstone torch but be able to be switched and and off directly. This might make it very useful in some redstone circuits as well because the redstone lantern could work like a redstone torch that is already in the off state without being switched off by something else. Then it can be switched on by a circuit in the same way that a normal redstone torch would be switched off or vice verse if it was left in the on state (then it would act like a normal redstone torch).</p>",
