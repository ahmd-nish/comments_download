It will try to shoot your strider if you mount one, so be careful geting there.It can heal itself by touching lava, though the healing isn't great, and if you attack the Elemental it will stop. It carries a giant netherite battle axe called the Elemental axe that it, of course, drops when it dies. The Elemental axe has less power than a netherite sword, but it can throw fireballs and will set your enemies on fire. The Elemental has 100 health, the power of a ghast, player holding Elemental axe, or blaze (Depends on attack type), and the same speed as the wither.</p>",
