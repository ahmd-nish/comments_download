AND the best! the biome u can find each gemstone must vary!! etc u can find garnet only in savana! HOHOHO!</p>",

More players would try making or using golden apple or enchanted golden apple pies (which could tie in with the recent Nick's Minecraft Ice Cream flavor as silly reference) for pies to increase the base (enchanted) golden apple saturation while giving the effects the base apples would give. Basically it gives more hunger while being the apple with effects. You take your materials and get more out of your foods which rewards you for farming and cooking. The golden apple pie in particular would reward you for building gold farms or taking the time to gather lots of gold and farm apples with good effects and a more filling version than a gold apple on its own.</p>\n<p>Pie is such a staple and variable food that it shouldn't be restricted to just pumpkins, we have apples, gold apples, carrots, etc. all could be put into pies and give more hunger for what you do have if you don't have pumpkins.</p>",

This would allow the player to pick from a variety of preset edits without the need for new tools. This could include anything from vertical slabs to vertical corner stairs and so on. My suggestion then would be to allow this for any full block. This to me would be the silentest approach while still catering to a large variety of things players want.&nbsp;<br><br>If this new crafting block can give the player control to edit the block directly and even mix blocks, then you can REALLY get creative with making your own windows&nbsp; or other blocks to customize your home/builds. This second part may be a little stretched for being simple, but as minecraft has always been open to giving players more freedom to create, I honestly feel this would be the next best addition.</p>",

Brooms should only be flyable in the overworld, upon entering another dimension it will go crazy, flick you off &amp; return through the nearest portal or simply disappear with a bolt of lightning, you would then find it leaning against something near the portal you entered in the overworld in need of more fuel/nourishment. Perhaps this mechanic could be utilized for creating charged creapers in survival?</p>\n<p>5. If these brooms are craftable it should be very difficult. I think it should have a similar mechanic to Snow Golems, perhaps by placing a hay bale on the bottom then placing a wooden fence post on top or a stripped log, then a totem of undying at the very top &amp; activating the transformation with a splash bottle of enchantment or potion of levitation.</p>",

To avoid Minecraft's general dislike of large placeable items, taking up more than 1x2 blocks (there may be a programming/efficiency reason for this) it could also be made possible for you to just place normal doors/trapdoors in a pattern then they join together as someone mentioned above. However, I can see this being really frustrating to actually use (doors joining together when you don't want them to) so the big door item is probably best.</p>\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the devs seem very reluctant to add these sorts of complex decorative items; people have been asking for furniture building capability pretty much since the original betas and it hasn't happened, but doors really do seem like low-hanging fruit.</p>",

For example; a plains biome would show up green on a map normally but if there's a cave underneath the surface, then its shape would show up as a darker shade of green on the map. Basically it would only show that there is a cave, not how deep it is bellow the surface.</p>\n<p>Any lower caves would just mix with the above caves on the map and look like a bigger cave. If that sounded confusing think about it this way. On the map if there's a cave over another cave, there would be no way to distinguish the two from each other. So their shapes would just overlap and appear as one on the map.</p>\n<p>Love the idea! Hope to see it in the Fan Update! Kind of reminds me of how the map from leg o worlds works.</p>",

Only the last non-air block below the limit is used on the map. This can be used not only for cave/underground maps, but also above-ground floorplans. I would suggest renaming this to \"Floorplan\".<br><br>But a better way to implement this would be to use an empty map on a lodestone. This changes the map to a floorplan and sets the Y-level limit to the Y-level of the lodestone. Y-level can't be reset once it is set, but the map can update as usual unless \"frozen\" using a glass pane in a cartography table (as you can do with ordinary filled maps.)</p>\n<div style=\"color: black; background-color: #ffff80; font-family: 'Lucida Console', 'Courier New', Mono; text-align: right; max-width: 600px; font-size: 80%;\">&nbsp;</div>",

The maps that are placed in the Atlas are locked, but can be replicated with the cartography table to unlock them. (this is mainly to prevent lag, but also can be used to make an art book)</p>\n<p>3. The maps can be displayed on a lectern, or you can right click with the atlas to view the maps like a written book. At the top of the map screen, the page is labeled with the name of the map.</p>\n<p>4. the cloud texture from the map is replaced with the paper texture.</p>\n<p>5. Maybe there could be a way to combine Atlases, maps, written books, banners, etc...</p>",

I don't personally have any experience with minecraft griefers, but i can definitely say from personal experience, that if you are <strong>irreversibly re-texturing</strong> an entire block, it is reasonable to say that it shouldn't be so easy to do.&nbsp; To sum it up, i think this is a fix that minecraft is very overdue.</p>",

I see other mods that implemented minecart linking, and since none actually changed the physics when the minecarts are connected, the result is that one minecart ends up bumping into the neigboor one, basically killing any forward movement needed for autonomous railroads.</p>\n<p>Of course, things like the automation system using signs can be ignored, because i think that, if the linked minecarts had shared inertia/momentum and doesn't go bumping each other, the player can actually use existent redstone mechanics to automatize stations and such.</p>\n<p>Another feature that can be added in tandem to add even more possibilites <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/2n421s/new_nbt_tag_to_load_chunks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">is a NBT tag for entities to keep the chunk they are in loaded</a>, regardless of player presence in the region (i remade that suggestion here in the site, pending approval). If both ideas gets in the game, players can actually made long-range autonomous railroads without the need of any mod, that can revolutionize the transport in-game.</p>",

To control these, you shouldn’t need a furnace cart, (a lot of) powered rails will boost to full speed. Perhaps if the powered rail is only at a certain signal strength, it will boost/slow down to a speed (so powered rails at 5 signal strength make the carts go to 10m/s).</p>\n<p>You could balance this by long trains not being able to go up steep hills or around sharp corners (E.g., a 4 long train going up 1 block for every 4 across, and goes around 4 block radius corners).</p>",

To compensate for this limitation you can stay underwater for as long as you like but are very limited in how far you move around, your speed and the longer you stay underwater and the deeper you go the more damage your suit will take over time.<br><br>The main purpose of the suit would be an early option to building underwater, not to explore, if you want to explore you'd have to get the water breathing potion unless you set up the suit right above a water temple or ship wreck.<br><br>This way you can build underwater without having to go into the nether yet but the water breathing potion is still the better alternative that you can switch to once you get the resources to do so.<br><br>Personally I find the turtle shell helmet really useless, so for me this would be a very appreciated addition to the game.</p>",

It doesn't make sense.</p>\n<p>There is nothing wrong with it being used for decoration. I use compressed blocks to decorate all the time. The fact that I could decompress them for the product does absolutely nothing to hinder my use in such a way.</p>\n<p>The argument that you don't want this block to be deconstructed because you MIGHT use it in other nether constructions for future updates is honestly not a good one.</p>\n<p>Take the updates before nether wart was a fortress exclusive thing. People still went to go find the fortress. They where stable ground in the highly destructive landscape filled with ghasts, They have loot chests, and some mobs only spawn consistently within these fortresses. The game will not be lesser in this regard if nether wart of all things could be found in another construction .</p>\n<p>Which leads me to the second point. If this block, that apparently can be found in another build within the nether still can't be deconstructed into nether wart, and I have to assume that this block is one of the big reasons to find this place, because we have nothing to go on other than the quote that it MIGHT be used in a future update. Why would you give me FEWER reasons to want to find this other structure? wouldn't the draw be \"Hey there's a versatile, and useful block here, I want to go find this new structure.\" Otherwise all I'd think is\"Well I could go look for this new structure to get this decoration block already made. . .&nbsp; .or I could go to the fortress where there is this and everything else a fortress has to catch my attention.\"</p>\n<p>Shouldn't a new structure include the incentive to find it? Otherwise you wind up with the same issue that came with lamas and parrots. You got something that looks nice. . . but it does basically nothing for you but look good.
