Even cooked cod is a more effective food in terms of saturation.&nbsp;<br>I see some confusion around the internet about their viability as a food source. I just want to clear something up: Originally honey was equivalent to cooked salmon restoring 6 hunger points (points, NOT bars) and 9.6 saturation (saturation will indirectly effect how much your health can regen but is NOT a health regen stat). That would have been a very nice food source. With honey bottles saturation nerfed to a measly 2.4 they are now a fairly worthless food source more in line with apples or chorus fruit. <br>Buff saturation back to 9.6 and I will start farming and carrying honey bottles. Also, for me, the poison nullification effect isn't enough to justify a precious inventory slot. Make it cure the wither effect. Or maybe instead of just curing poison (or wither?) it could also give resistance? I really like the health boost idea in the suggestion. Maybe it would be similar to the absorption effect from golden/notch apples? Honey bottles have a lot of potential as a food source but are largely untapped as of now. Let's do something about that!</p>",

However, personally the absolute protection from damage caused by other players is over powered. Maybe instead of completely stopping outside players from destroying any block, Mining Fatigue III could be applied, making their block destruction quite slow. This would give the owners of the protected areas a chance to defend their land, but also gives concepts like castle sieges a possibility, instead of letting attackers cut through a stone wall instantly with a diamond pickaxe. Probably all types of block placing by outsiders should be prohibited because just a bucket of water or lava could do all sorts of damage.</p>\n<p>In addition, preventing (quick) block destruction could permit people to make redstone gate and combination mechanisms, actually encouraging the visitors to determine the key or code to enter instead of mining their way through the door.</p>",
