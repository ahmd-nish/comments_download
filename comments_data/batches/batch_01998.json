I used to want an attack button but now I know that some players would complain that the button would not be in the right place for their claw. Also attacking while sprint will deactivate the sprint and this is not a bug. Computer players have a function called sprint resetting which allow them to reset their sprint by letting go of the w key and pressing it again or by pressing the s key while holding the w key. Unfortunately pocket players do not have this function tho they won’t need it in the next combat update because of the new 200 percent attack mechanic.</p>",

The padding and placement of the tabs compared to the content. The tabs are currently at the very top of the screen at all time, with no padding, far away and disconnected from the content. On large screens especially it can look very wonky when the tabs are at the very top with a massive gap until the content. The create new world and cancel buttons at the bottom are a very similar story.</p>\n<p>2. The tabs don't look like tabs. They look like buttons. and when one is selected, it doesn't look selected, it looks like a disabled button. I think the tabs need a separate look from the buttons.</p>\n<p>3. The 'more' tab feels like it should be a menu, or something else. With only 2 buttons inside that open separate pages, it feels like an extra unnecessary step.</p>\n<p>4. Everything feels empty. There isn't a lot of content under each tab. maybe this will change in the future, but currently there is very little in the first and third tab, and still not that much in the middle one.</p>\n<p>5. The first tab's alignment of the buttons with the text field is weird - the buttons look unnecessarily wide for their content and the text field could be wider.</p>\n<p>That's it for me really. I do feel like the World Creation screen needed an overhaul, hopefully it can get better until release.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

However, there are some minor issues that should be fixed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tabs are not very nicely positioned, and using the \"disabled\" state of a button as \"active tab\" is not very intuitive. Optimally, Java Edition would have a new tab UI component to be used for this - but at the very least, there should be some spacing between the buttons and the edge of the screen.</li>\n<li>It does not make much sense for the \"More\" tab to just have two buttons that bring you to different screens. Instead, there should be four tabs: \"Game\", \"World\", \"Game rules\", and \"Data packs\"</li>\n<li>The dirt background is ugly. Some screens (like video options, or the game rule screen) use a different layout where the middle part of the screen is darkened. This would give the world creation screen some more structure.<br>(Side note: This affects a lot more screens - why not change the dirt background to something else for once, that could be fun? For example, for the wild update, the background could be mud. Or, even better, have the panorama in the background?)</li>\n<li>I don't personally mind, but I've seen people mention that they prefer having the description text for the game mode directly as a label below the game mode selection button over using a tooltip for that.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course Java's menu UI could use a facelift as a whole - but that's not really relevant to the new create world screen per se.</p>",

It's nice thing that tells you what screen it is, which can be useul for newer players.<br><br>The world name currently lacks the \"saved as\" information in case of dupliceted names.<br>(Through also other fun idea: randomised world names, but thats not really required)<br><br>The tab/nav buttons lack any margins, being sticked to the top (only ingame ui doing that). So moving them lower and without filling entire width could help (see Statistics ui).<br><br>Same with selected button, instead being displayed as disabled, it could be force highlighted (like stats ui) or a new texture (colored tint, classic java blue one or bedrock green, either works).<br><br>The \"More\" category as is feels kinda unnecessary, as buttons for gamerules/datapacks could be moved into other two (ideally first one, as both are a \"game\" options). Alternatively they could be converted into tabs. Not sure if it would fit through, I don't know your future plans.&nbsp;</p>",

I'm sure a lot of people put a lot of work into it, trying to mix old with new, but, with how spaced out and empty the screen is, it feels cold. The world page is thicker than the other two, extra has three things, one of which was already on the game tab. The bottom of all of them feel empty. The dirt background is iconic but a more lively background might help. Perhaps each Tab could have a different block? Maybe moving the layout of each tab closer to the centre?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The tabs are cool but add to that separated feeling and some of them make little sense to me. Is 'game rules' not not part of the game? Why is it in more? Why is 'experiments' in twice? Why do the true or false settings in 'World' have a separate side button while cheats in the 'game' tab is also true or false but has the classic button style? What was wrong with the import and export options?</p>\n<p>I'm confused and every time I go to create a world all I can think is the 'look at what they did to my boy' meme.&nbsp;</p>",
