It's a stealth mission, not a combat mission. Not all hostile mobs need to be something we fight and try to kill for rewards. A dark and deep cave biome is the perfect opportunity to introduce new unique gameplay to the game, especially so stealth as it's the best way to bring that fear and vulnerability of the first night for late-gamers. The Warden is designed to be impossibly hard to kill, to the point where even if you are very skilled and technically can, it would be too tedious for you to try when it has no rewards or even a trophy anyways, practically reinforcing the intended gameplay.</p>",
