Using a bucket on a glow squid will collect it's luminescence and revert it to a regular squid (similar to shearing a mooshroom). The bucket of luminescence will act as a mobile light source in item form (similar to some torch mods). The catch is that the luminesence will eventually run out (indicated by a durability bar) and turn back into a water bucket. I think this would make a nice compromise for the players who request that torches emit light when carried or to add a mining helmet.&nbsp;</p>",

Basically expanding the effect from close proximity to the conduit, to being anywhere within the conduit's underwater breathing effect area for the player. This would allow players to secure areas near villages or bases from the constant barrage of drowned in nearby water sources. If not outright suffocating them, then perhaps just compelling them to stay underwater?</p>\n<p>As for drowned spawning, perhaps they can only spawn on certain underwater blocks. Maybe just gravel? That would reduce the number of locations they could spawn by a good margin, considering dirt and sand make up a good portion of the underwater landscape. Also, gravel because they have that absolutely annoying gravelly gurgling sound they make.</p>\n<p>I do like the concept of boosting health regen and/or defenses of pets inside the conduit. That would allow pet axolotls to patrol the waters and take out the unruly drowned. It might even be nice to have the same pets affected by the conduit compelled to stay within the effect area for such patrols, not allowing them to leave that area at all.&nbsp;</p>",

I would prefer if enchanting tables were made the same way, but you could combine an enchanting tome with the enchanting table to make a more powerful enchanting table that lets you enchant things with enchantments that are normally only effects in commands such as blindness, nausea, darkness, etc. My final opinion for this comment, I think that if you combined an enchanting table with an enchanting tome you could get another tab in the enchanting table, but for curses. Please consider this and if you don't like the changes then I can understand. Thx!!!</p>",
