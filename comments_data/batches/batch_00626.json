Arguably, the game is set in a somewhat medieval era as there are swords, axes, bows, and other tools/weapons relevant with this time period. Adding something such as a 'plane,' 'helicopter,' or other modern invention would not fit in well with the surrounding mechanics. I don't mean to diminish your idea as there are many similar things to what you are suggesting such as: the elytra, redstone and slime block flying machines, and even various mods which could allow you to explore non-vanilla experience. Hope this helps! :)</p>",

Additionally, having access to sideways/vertical slabs would undeniably expand the amount of creativity that could be put into builds rather than diminishing it, like the devs somehow genuinely believe. \n<br />An elaboration as to how on earth this argumentation is supposed to make sense would be very much appreciated at the very least.</p>",
