To counteract this high altitude freezing the player could wear leather armor to stay warm, but the higher the player goes, the colder it will get. So, the higher the player goes up, the more leather armor will be required to wear to stay warm. Some sorts of heat sources like the campfire and soul campfire, can also help with the cold. There is a lot of other ideas and concepts that can come from this, so I hope more people comment and add to this!</p>",

And by y=150-160, you start to see the oxygen bar effect, and after getting used to high altitude, the limit will slowly get higher but not more than around y=220, above which is the death zone. In addition, the effects mentioned above will also get worse with low oxygen and ascending rapidly. Finally, at y=384, void-like damage starts, and the player will lose three hearts every half second, even with a Respiration helmet to prevent players from getting to extreme altitude to AFK long-distance trips.</p>",

The only benefit Copper has is that it is a really nice decoration and building block. With that being said, not every build needs shades of dark green or bright orange. I don't think there will be a major use for copper so the only thing I can suggest is to reduce its abundancy.</p>",

If we fix this problem, and give amethyst a purpose that players will actually use, then yes, it will defeat the point of amethyst being rare.</p>\n<p>The mushroom island is highly sought out because you can ONLY get mooshroom mobs from that specific biome. The reason it wouldn't work for this is because everything you can find here (amethyst shards, blocks) can already be found in this biome. The crystal bats are a cool idea, but again, the reason the mooshroom mobs are highly-sought after is because they can create unlimited mushroom and suspicious stew. Crystal Bats just can't do that as nobody needs the shards to do anything.</p>\n<p>This biome will remain obsolete until the crystal bats have a unique drop and amethyst is revamped altogether.</p>",
