        "body": "<p>I move for a total revamp of the Polar Bear <br><br></p>\n<p>I tried to make a separate post about this but I guess it was to closely related to this one so I will add it here I think rideable Polar bears is a great Idea but I think they need a lot more.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The Polar Bear is a a great looking mob. And I cant help but have a moment of excitement when run into one. That is until I remember how fairly useless it is and like I said it makes me quite sad. So here is my attempt to do something about it.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mount</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Make the the bear a a mountable mob! Yea that's right what could be a cooler use for this mob than a new mount. If I am not mistaken Mincraft has not gotten a new mount since horses. The bear should be slightly faster than a pig but slower and fewer HP than a horse. It can't jump more than 1 block but can step over 2 blocks.The unique ability of this mount is that it has a powerful melee attack and a huge game changer for up close melee combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Weapons while mounted -</p>\n<p>As the polar bear has such a lumbering gate it would likely be impossible to effectively fire a bow or swing a sword while mounted on a bear and in motion.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Domesticating-</p>\n<p>Taming a polar bear should not be easy they are not know for having the best temperament. This could be accomplished not by changing the polar bear to a hostile mob outright but when you are holding a raw salmon in your hand and you are within x amount of blocks of the mob it becomes hostel. (and peaceful again when you are not holding raw salmon that is unless you already hit it.) this would keep balance to the game for players that are not looking to tame these mobs. Getting clawed by one of these giants should be quite devastating toy your health bar. So the fact that you would need to expend a large amount of salmon to convince this beast that you are trust worthy would be quite difficult. Befriending such an animal would be quite an accomplishment and a distinct advantage in combat.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mounting-</p>\n<p>As if domesticating a polar bear wasn't difficult enough. You cant just hop on a polar bear and head off to inflict damage Mounting a bear requires equipping it with a bear saddle.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bear Saddle-</p>\n<p>The Bear Saddle is a craft able item that a player will need to make. This Item should be crafted by adding on to a horse saddle with another materials like additional leather and Iron. This would require that the player do some exploring and presumably engaging in combat before obtaining the polar bear mount.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A possible Bear Saddle recipe <br><br>0 S 0<br>L 0 L</p>\n<p>L I L</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Drops-</p>\n<p>Personally I am of the opinion that all mobs should drop useful items. So lets address some possible useful items that a polar bear could drop</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bear Hide -</p>\n<p>a.) Bear hide can be tanned just like cow hide and made into leather IRL. So why not in Mincraft too throw it in a furnace get a few leather.</p>\n<p>b.) Use the Fletcher station block to turn a bear hide into a bed roll. Bed Rolls can be used to sleep and skip the night without changing you spawn away from your bed. This is especially useful now that phantoms are something that we need to contend with now.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bear Meat- It doesn't make any sense that an animal this size wouldn't be able to provide a substantial amount of food for a person. Raw and cooked bear meat should provide less than a raw or cooked steak respectively as it is not the most tasty and satisfying meat. But a bear s hould drop 3-5 pieces at least as the Polar Bear Is a large animal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bear Meat Stew-Raw Bear Meat, a Bowl, a Bottle of Water and, a Carrot in a crafting bench would make Bear Meat stew leaving an empty glass bottle in the bench this would provide the same hunger replenishment as a cooked steak and a carrot with improved saturation and provide the strength buff for a short time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bear's Head- Its a helmet same stats as iron but can be enchanted with a new enchantments that can only be put on this item.</p>\n<p>a.) Predator's Instinct- When in use causes double XP to drop from mobs and players that you kill.</p>\n<p>b.) Fight or Flight- When in use XP converts into health. If you drop to 3 or less hearts you get a speed bonus</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bear Claw Boots- Just like leather boots in stats but allows you so climb flat wooden black faces useful for harvesting trees or climbing wooden structures, climb a fort wall, or take a tactical sniper position on a roof. Can be used to climb non wooden surfaces but the boots take heavy damage when you do.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Bear Armor- It's found in igloos obviously. It could be in the furnace. its hard to find but is extremely valuable because bears have lower HP and are slow. Your bear mount is is going to need armor if you intend to ride into any serious combat. Bear armor can be enchanted with most of the standard armor enchantments.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Maybe they could have a unique feature like attacking instead of jumping, and this would make up for having to hold the fish on a stick and not being able to use a weapon. They should still attack you if you attack them, or if there is a baby polar bear around, and they would kick you off if you tried to ride them while they are aggravated similar to how a horse kicks you off if you don't successfully tame it. This would make it so polar bears have a unique use that is not too overpowered, and it stays true to how the game currently is, and still warns people to stay away from angry polar bears in the real world.</p>",

Currently their really isn't many flying things in the nether and it could be really cool to have something like a bird made of fire, twice the size of a parrot.</p>\n<p>I don't know about the taming part though. The Phoenix is made of fire and it doesn't make sense that it is tameable like that since the player would probably take fire damage when in contact. Instead, you could gain its trust in which it won't attack you follows you, but only give natural light and cooks food that you drop near it. So it can still be a tameable but a little more nerfed so mojang doesn't have doubts with this idea.</p>",

A player can tame a phoenix by giving it raw rabbit. Once you've tamed the phoenix, it will attack mobs that you're attacking. When it is killed, it turns into ash. From the ash, it will be reborn exactly as it was before it was killed. However, after being reborn, it must wait 10 seconds before it can attack again. The phoenix can be healed with fish.</p>\n<p data-start=\"522\" data-end=\"994\">You can make a pillar for the phoenix, which you receive after taming it. The phoenix will only sit on its pillar if you click on it and if it is within range of the pillar. To assign a pillar to a phoenix, you must place the pillar within the phoenix's range and then click on the phoenix. You can move the pillar, but if you destroy it, the phoenix won’t have anywhere to sit. If you place the pillar again, it will be empty and you can assign the phoenix to it again.</p>\n<p data-start=\"996\" data-end=\"1086\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">The phoenix has 20 health points and 6 attack points. You can only have one tamed phoenix. Phoenix is of dark red color</p>",

        "body": "<p>Here's how I would implement flamingos: 🦩\n<br />They would spawn naturally in jungles and swamps (But not the Mangrove Swamp, just the regular swamp to make the regular swamp more unique) and would eat similar to how sheep eat grass and turn it into dirt, but instead, the flamingos would dip their heads down and \"eat\" from the water as they are filter-feeders. They may also seek out frogspawn and try to eat that as well. They can also be tamed with frogspawn. Flamingos when they are first born will be white, but as they eat they will become more and more pink. Flamingos should also have the ability to fly as they do in real life, and if needed maybe shears could be used to clip flamingo feathers which temporarily makes them unable to fly. These flamingo feathers will not drop if the mob is killed. These special feathers can only be acquired if the flamingo is fully pink. If it is only partially pink, the feathers will be white and normal. Pink feathers however, can be used to craft anything a normal feather can craft, like brushes and arrows, but these flamingo arrows will have a longer range, and flamingo brushes will have stronger durability. </p>\n\n<p>The feather idea could totally be scrapped, I just really love the idea of a bright pink mob adding a splash of color to an otherwise very dull biome like the swamp.</p>",
