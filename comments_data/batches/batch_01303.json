Toggle sneak was designed to be an accessibility setting, so it is a fair reason to want to make a change. Admittedly, this change does almost nothing to effect 90% of players, though for a small subset of people it will become one of the hardest nerfs to our playstyle in the game's entire history.</p>\n<p>I can not express enough how crucial it has become for many of us in the trapping community that we are able to perform activities such as crafting, opening chests, and writing signs or in chat all without revealing our nametag to enemy players roaming the surface. It may be true that an invisibility potion will fully counteract this change, though in a UHC / battle royale type scenario, the time restraints commonly involved will render it almost impossible for players who wish to build a trap secretly to do so.</p>\n<p>To restore parity between these two options without the involved negative impact to the trapping community in the latest snapshot's change, I suggest my own potential solution. A secondary sneaking keybind can be introduced. Players will have their original keybind set to regular, non-toggle sneak, and the new keybind will allow the player to toggle sneak. This will allow players who do not use toggle sneak to have the option to open their inventory / interact with other GUI while sneaking, and players who do use toggle sneak to remain unaffected.</p>",

Previously, when players activated sneak toggle, they could confidently rely on their character to remain crouched regardless of opening the inventory, which was essential for survival situations, stealth mechanics, building on edges, and accessibility for players who rely on toggle rather than hold controls. This consistency made Minecraft smoother, because sneaking is not just a cosmetic action, it directly impacts safety by preventing accidental falls, hiding name tags during PvP, and maintaining immersion when building high structures or working near lava. By removing this, Mojang has unintentionally broken muscle memory developed over years and created unnecessary frustration, especially for disabled players who cannot hold down keys and depended on toggle being trustworthy. Imagine carefully crouching on a skyblock edge, opening your chest to grab blocks, and suddenly finding yourself unsneaked and one misclick away from death—this is not fun design, this is unfair punishment for a problem that never existed. The community never demanded this change, and calling it a “fix” ignores the fact that the old behavior was actually the correct one for accessibility and game logic. Mojang has always championed player choice</p>",

Both while afk at farms and while sneaking around spawn, where players are constantly monitoring for a player to stop crouching and a nametag to show.&nbsp;<br><br>There is no obvious benefit to the update. There is a SIGNIFICANT benefit to leaving that feature the way it was. How is it that with something this unique and thousands of players signing a petition Mojang has done nothing...</p>",

Also consider anarchy servers where there are no rules and (for the most part) no bans. Anarchy servers will be mass report everyone with the use of hacked clients, no system you build will be able to handle that, no amount of people can verify all those reports are legit. Server moderation has always been left to the server owners, admins, and moderators. By being able to ban people from all servers, they are taking away control from the players. How long until Mojang under orders of Microsoft won't release server jars anymore? How long until private servers are abolished and you can only play on either realms or Microsoft approved servers? Will server owners have to pay a fee to Mojang/Microsoft to host their servers? Global bans are just one of the stepping stones to the downfall of Minecraft. There's and old saying among tradesmen, \"If it ain't broke don't fix it.\" Global bans are Microsoft fixing something that was never an issue to begin with.</p>",

For example, certain categories belong to servers with older players, other are very context-sensitive. Considering the amount of reports for the moderation team to filter, I highly doubt it will be possible to take the necessary details into account. It is especially worrying since false positives will result in bans to avoid false negatives, from what I understand. The fact that taking away control from server moderators is going to make the overall player experience worse is clear: we already have examples like shadow muting on servers and a terrible track record of a global ban system on Bedrock edition. This feature will either ruin multiplayer or be bypassed by server plugins. A lot of players bought licenses instead of resorting to pirating specifically to have access to multiplayer, so if Microsoft intends to keep Minecraft alive and running, I recommend they trust the community to moderate itself.</p>",

It only destroys the fun of playing in multiplayer, as you now have to fear that you could be reported for any reason whatsoever, even falsly because someone doesn't like you.</p>\n<p>And knowing current report systems can I imagine that it most likely will be semi-automated by having the account temporarily banned when too many reports come in, which in the end for sure will happen if someone has the great idea of abusing it (Think of DDoSing someone but instead of doing requests, they file dozens of reports).</p>\n<p>So, please, please, PLEASE Mojang. Keep this \"feature\" limited to First-party stuff (Realms) only! Third-party servers usually already have features in place to monitor things, and if you want to do anyone a favour, maybe allow server owners to define something like an e-mail to where reports on their server(s) will be sent to. That way could they deal with the reports in a way that fits their own rules and guidelines.</p>",

We, the Minecraft community, are outraged and scared of what's to come from this change.

It doesn't make sense, we didn't pay you (Mojang) just to not have access to our own server. I also haven't talked about the \"Professional Moderators\" too. It is flawed and utterly exploitable.

It would literally take a team of thousands of people just to moderate the chat, and even if the team only made a single mistake per day, that would be 365 mistakes in a year. That's 10,950 dollars by the people who owned the accounts, and that's not even including taxes. And yet, this is probably one of the&nbsp;<strong>best</strong> scenarios that can happen with chat reporting being a thing. Chances are that they'll make dozens of mistakes every day, leading to dozens of people losing out on their hard earned money. I see where mojang is coming from, but I really don't know how they could have implimented chat reporting worse.</p>",

What do people do when rules are added that restrict freedom? They cause more trouble then would have originally happened as a form of protest and they weaponize the rule against others. We already have bot account swarms on anarchy servers. What stops the same thing from happening to the chat report system? No spam filter can reasonably deal with that. Oh wait, yes one can! Its called letting the server owners handle things. A big automated system and team of people will never be able to handle the load as well as a decentralized per server system. Plus, they will never respect what the community views as bad or good. What if something is found really offensive on a server do to culture, but that isn't deemed offensive elsewhere.</p>",

However, the way it is being implemented brings up some serious concerns. Many servers that I, and many other adult players use, are private servers hosted on our own personal devices or through third-party hosting services. Many of these servers are whitelisted so that only those we know are allowed onto these servers. In these servers, we may talk about adult topics or use adult language because we are all old enough and comfortable with it. I think it would be best if private servers had the opportunity to opt out of the chat reporting and ban system. That way, servers that want to keep Mojang's level of moderation will be able to easily, and servers that want to do the moderating themselves can do so as well.</p>\n<p>To address any concern about player safety with an opt-out feature, servers that have opted out should have a warning screen when joining, stating that the server the player is about to join has opted out of the chat-moderation program, and may contain content not suitable for everyone.

It requires stupidity on the level of not being able to use a computer to believe that a random Minecrafter is some person they claim to be</p>\n<p>2. Be extremely, extremely careful with the imminent harm categories and the harassment and bullying categories. These are most likely to be abused/taken out of context. As an example, someone could say \"I'm going to kill you\" or \"Your dead\" in reference to PVP, or, in the case of the harassment and bullying category, somebody who joined an anarchy/factions server could report harassment through threats to grief their base, even though that is kind of the point of the server/game.</p>\n<p>3. Allow some way to disable the feature for servers. If not directly in the config, maybe allow it in some way to server owners that can prove that their server has effective moderation.</p>\n<p>4. Be very, very, very careful about bans. Especially perma-bans. Compared to other games known for banning people willy-nilly (Roblox), users have paid more than $25 for this game. Just mis-banning someone, even if they can appeal will really rub people the wrong way.</p>\n<p>5.

Realms are hosted by Microsoft, great, but realms are invite only, and you can choose to remove people who cause problems. Third party servers are <em><strong>NOT</strong></em> hosted by Microsoft and Microsoft should have <em><strong>NO</strong></em> business determining <strong><em>who</em></strong> is allowed to play on said third party servers nor <strong><em>what</em></strong> is allowed in said servers; third party servers are either small enough that the server owner can block/ban people that they don't want on their server, or are large enough to have a team of administrators and moderators that will do that work.</p>\n<p>Chat reporting can be a major problem because <em>server owners</em> determine what is allowed on the server that they host, if someone else finds the IP and decides they don't like <em>adults</em> discussing <em>adult</em> things on a primarily <em>adult</em> server, players on said server can be banned from <strong>ALL</strong> online play, completely out of the hands of the server they were on.</p>\n<p>And what will happen when there aren't enough employees to moderate reported chats? A bot is used and limits the chances or likelihood for any appeals? Essentially chasing players away from the game because they can no longer play online with friends? So many problems arise from implementing this idea, with so few things to be improved.</p>\n<p>Make it <em><strong>optional and off by default</strong></em>, or scrap it altogether, there are way too many issues with that concept, especially for servers hosted by third parties.</p>",

For example, are reports about imminent illegal actions sent to the police?</li>\n<li>What is the purpose of the \"self-harm\" category? Will moderators ban people from online play for suffering from mental illness? If so, that seems extremely counter-productive. A better response would be to provide the player with the phone number of a suicide prevention hotline.</li>\n<li>How are your moderators trained? Are they employees of Mojang Studios or of Microsoft? Will you have enough moderators to handle all of the reports from such a large playerbase, while still giving the due attention that each report requires?</li>\n<li>Will your moderators be able to handle reports submitted in languages other than English?</li>\n<li>Does a ban from online play prevent playing with other players via the \"Open to LAN\" feature of singleplayer worlds?</li>\n<li>Does a ban from online play prevent playing on a server that has a whitelist?

If WE set Rules on OUR Server that WE pay for then these rules go. If we want an anachry server like 2b2t then let it be, WE pay for the server. As well as that there will be hacks, mods, clients that just absolutly spam you with ban reports. The banning spree will be like a tsunami wave. Also idk understand why you would sacrafice time, money and employes just for this feature that no one askes for. You saw what happened in bedrock, you knew there was already backlash but did you think on java there wouldnt be any?? Dont expect this feature to just be accepted. As well is that i wish i never did the microsoft Migration, sacrificing my free space where i joke with my friends just for a cape was a bad deal. PLS mojang and microsoft DONT DO THIS</p>",

I shouldnt have to do this. Systematic abuse is a terrible thing and while Im capable of handling it like an adult many probably cant. I am speaking up in the name of many other LGBTQA2+ and BIPOC people I know and possibly dont know who are too scared to say things on this important matter themselves. We need to take a stand against online harassment and this is a fantastic way against this. If you arent being actively offensive you shouldnt have to worry about being banned.

        "body": "<p>Even more reasons why global bans are a really bad idea (2/2):</p>\n<p>-The \"in game\" problem: The fact is, this game includes lethal weapons, poison, fire and explosives. There are thousands of servers that feature some form of group player versus player combat or long term \"war\" (such as most factions servers). Considering the nature of such (again, <em>privately owned</em>) servers, many of them would deem in-game \"threats\" acceptable. Examples would be \"threats\" to blow up one's house, or to kill their character or group of Minecraft characters. These messages can and <em><strong>will</strong> </em>be reported as harassment or terrorism, resulting in unnecessary bans.</p>\n<p>- Report abusing, report spamming, bots: I would argue that it is quite obvious that people <em><strong>will&nbsp;</strong></em>attempt to abuse the feature. While mild cases will consist of players just reporting other players that they do not like, the problems comes when people use bots, multiple accounts or just a lot of time to flood the report system, in order to disrupt it or get people banned</p>\n<p>-Scalability: considering the scale of the game, manual reviews are prone to become impractical, which could lead to automated bans</p>\n<p>-Existence of better solutions: as the problem being tackled is player safety, it could be improved by instead adding more parental control features, servers opting <strong>in</strong> for such a feature, making a \"friends only\" chat feature or even having servers signal whether they are a safe, family-friendly environment</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I don't believe parity between java and bedrock is warranted; there's a reason why the platforms are separate.</p>\n<p>Community-run servers are java's main focus, and by adding a chat reporting function that goes straight to Mojang, server owners have less agency over the servers that they own or pay for.</p>\n<p>There's not enough context for a Mojang employee to get a clear and accurate picture of the situation. If I'm insulting my friend in a joking way and he's reciprocating, another person on the server could report it and we could end up banned. The case-reader has no context for the situation and would thus see it as an acceptable reason to ban. This has been seen many times on Bedrock with many cases of false bans.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>There's also the matter of how these logs are kept. On a server like Hypixel where you need to use /shout to talk to other teams will this be effective? I assume Hypixel uses a tellraw rather than an actual chat message, so could someone bypass the chat filter using commands? There's also the /me command on many servers. I feel more clarification would be helpful for the community because as it stands, the addition of a chat filter is the wrong move.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p><strong>No one asked for this change</strong>. It adds a second layer of paternalistic moderation. Servers already moderate there own chat and if they dont your already implemented warning about 3rd party servers is enough. The only thing this will lead to is targeted attacks on creators, big people in communities and people who have a rare or desirable account. In addition Minecraft chat will completely die as players result to using 3rd party applications to communicate. Since the Minecraft server cannot moderate external programs this will mean it will go from one team moderating to two teams trying to moderate but failing because neither of them can view content not on Minecraft but via private chats. This will increase toxicity and everything your trying to prevent with your incredibly flawed system. At minimum this should be a completely optional setting that is <strong>off by default</strong> (And should include a notice when joining a Microsoft moderated server) and no ban whatsoever should be permanent. False bans happen all the time but its one thing when your banned from one server its another when your banned from a game which you have supported for years and bought. I care not who is pushing for these changes (Microsoft or Mojang) these are objectively a bad idea for the community and I have yet to find a single person happy with this change. You wanted our opinion. Here it is.</p>",

Server owners (and their subsequent moderating teams) have been able to effectively moderate servers without intervention from outside sources. The new change would make sense if it were applied only to realms, where the servers are hosted and owned my Microsoft rather than 3rd parties (which should be allowed to pick their own rules on their servers that they pay for).</p>\n\n<p>What? What has caused the apparent 'need' for this update to be implemented. The community of java players have not had a problem with the older format of punsihment.</p>\n\n<p>How? How and why does the actions on one server (which may even allow some of the things that you could get reported for on their server, within legality) allow you to get banned from the entirety of multiplayer and realms? For example you could use a profanity on a server which formally allows it, and then a troll false reports you for said actions and then you are banned for no reason?</p>\n\n<p>However, I concede that there are positive elements to this update such as the introduction of a TOGGLEABLE profanity filter (please keep it Toggleable) and the other report options seem to be more reasonable and inline with what you would expect.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, I see this update as a negative to the java experience besides its [few and far between] upsides, and should have the changes written in the comment and surrounding comments acted upon.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you. </p>",

It's just the fact that now I could say anything and without context I could get banned for it. Imagine your in a server and you say \"Yea I got a few dogs.\" then after that you say \"They are all bitches\" But if a player reports the last statement, they will get banned because there isnt the \"dog\" before it. Bitch is the name of a female dog, so if someone reports that without realising the context before it they can just get banned. In every game with a ban system there can always be false bans. What about duped accounts? Smidge for example, imagine for whatever reason they are in a realms world and they say \"just pop your stuff in a chest and die\" and the other gets banned. There are just to many problems. It's just better to remove it than use it as an experiment where thousands of innocent minecraft players could get banned.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If my reasonings are bad then forgive me. I just feel this is an unjustified reason for minecraft and it should never be implemented. Anarchy servers are ruined now which people had fun. I don't know what people thought implementing this but its just outrageous and if mojang truly wants the community to be happy then listen to what we say or else this will be the downfall of minecraft.

Servers for the entirety of Minecraft's lifespan in Java edition have been able to moderate there own servers. There are mods and plugins that help with that, and each server should be able to moderate their own. When u now have someone else moderating, things can be taken out of context, and players can be given false bans. As a server owner, I should get to determine on what counts as a rule or not. Not the mod team</p>\n<p>2. Exploitation and abuse. This whole entire system is completely flawed. A mod from the mod team can give out false bans for something that they don't like. I don't trust some random \"experienced\" mod to deal with moderating my server. Just like u don't trust random people with your banking info or other sensitive information. This leads to a lack of control, which will cause a mass exodus of players.</p>\n<p>If this whole system is not taken down, or is made optional or restricted to only realms, then the community that the game developed over the last decade will leave.</p>",

Would there be any system that would notice if someone gets falsly mass reported by any chance? Reporting players's messages will be abused a lot. Furthermore I find it really scummy that the game wouldn't just automatically cancel your realms subscription if you get banned by these reports. Also, would any of these bans that accured by chat message reports be permanent or some of them just temporarily? Because obviously some messages aren't as harmful as others. I don't even understand how could you even get permanently banned by message reports unless it's promoting cheats or something. You are telling us that you listen to community feedback but this is just an abvious lie into our faces. At least be honest to your own community. No one likes these changes.</p>",

Some chat messages are case sensitive, for example, in a faction war server, it would be completely normal to say \"I'm going to kill you\" in the chat, and people can now be banned for that.\n<br />The multiplayer community in java has been self moderated for more than 10 years, and there's been no problem with it.\n<br />Maybe, instead of forcing the chat moderation, you could give server admins the option to opt out of this feature. As a server admin myself, and one hosted in my own hardware, I do want to moderate the chat messages myself, and I do not want to play with the fear of being banned from my OWN server, hosted in my OWN hardware, because a bot at Microsoft thought I was being offensive to my friends. \n<br />Also, I think perma banning people from all multiplayer world's (public servers, private servers (even if people are paying for them) and even LAN world's is excessive.\n<br />Please, reconsider the way you're implementing this auto moderation, Minecraft. Untill that's done, I can firmly say that I'm not updating to 1.19 because I don't want to be banned from my own server.\n<br />Thank you, Minecraft</p>",

Not to mention, why even allow this on private servers? I hope there's going to be a setting to disable this nonsense, or even better, just don't add this new feature. The context in which messages are sent IS important, and without it you remove every single glimpse of good management. Your \"highly trained staff\" isn't going to understand the context of the message. It's simply impossible. For big influencers this is going to be absolutely atrocious. What if someone sends a message that says \"Drop down a cliff\" to help a friend know how to quickly die to go back to spawn, or if someone says \"I'm going to kill you\" during a battle royale minigame on a server? Think about this, Mojang! We know you're being pushed by Microsoft, but come on! Minecraft is so popular also for the players' freedom, and taking it away from us like this is unacceptable. Just look at how you STILL handle bans on Bedrock Edition. If I wasn't clear enough, PLEASE REMOVE THIS FEATURE before it's too late.</p>",

I love this game because there is absolutely nothing you <strong>can't </strong>do. You can install mods, create your own mods, change EVERYTHING about this game. Minecraft is what you make it out to be. It's a game that lets you choose the ending. It's a game that is now taking all of that away, just to appease parents who feel their child might be \"unsafe\" on multiplayer. This change is unimaginably easy to abuse, what with trolls and hackers using this feature as a weapon. If this feature is implemented how it is now it&nbsp;&nbsp; will end in the downfall of Minecraft. The one compromise that could be made is that it only bans you from realms, not multiplayer. Minecraft Multiplayer is the epitome of freedom in the multiplayer video game space, and taking this away would limit the player to the point that I know many people would quit Minecraft altogether for the fear of getting banned for any stupid reason. Multiplayer keeps Minecraft fresh and alive, and having the fear of getting banned for saying one thing would make a significant part of this community quit. It takes the liveliness out of a game when anything you do can be turned against you. Anything you've said can be taken out of context. Anything you've ever done on can be analyzed and used against the player. I know Minecraft will inevitably die, but I hope that it won't die because of a foolish corporate decision.</p>",

I understand where you are coming from in saying that kids play this game, but as has already been stated by the community thousands of times just about every server in all of Minecraft Java has its own very well run moderation system. If someone chooses to join a server that doesn’t have chat moderation that is their fault, especially considering the fact that they should be more eager to join servers like Hypixel rather than 2b2t. That brings me to the next point. Just imagine what this system will do to players who play on small private servers/realms or servers like 2b2t which specifically have no chat moderation rules? What if I just want to play Minecraft on a small server with my friends where we mess around and say whatever we want? Obviously that will not be possible with this new system. Finally, I am disgusted by the banning system. I can possibly understand being banned from multiplayer. If I say something dumb on a public server, sure I can be banned for a few days. Being banned from realms seems really dumb, however, especially considering the fact that your subscription is not cancelled when you are permanently banned. That seems to me like a really scummy way to make some extra dollars from your players. (Continues)</p>",

I agree we need better moderation tools I propose 1. Private servers can opt out. 2. Leverage Microsoft’s ai tools for sentiment detections for filtering chats. 3. Server operators can can submit chats upon review. I believe there are other options and just pushing the people that love to play this game away is unacceptable, and starting to be seen as inevitable. Their are and will be whole generations of players that will have their first and probably most notable online interaction here, and I believe it should be coached not a message that says “stay away” Make tools to help sever operators manage this. Realms servers that makes since there isn’t all the tools that Java servers have available it’s been abused. In the history of gaming these features have cut the community’s surrounding.I believe as a community if we know the extent of the problem we can help offer a better solution. But silencing others based off only a small percentage of context and not all of it is in an issue, you communicate through actions in the game not just through chat. Which more so makes me lean to it should be opted out by default. But when accepting Eula it should be an option and parental controls should allow players to not connect to non Microsoft lined servers. Like you already do.</p>",

Who am I going to be offending in single player, myself??? If I am banned from Multiplayer, realms, and single player, permanently, I literally cannot play Minecraft ever again and the 26 dollars that I spent on the game were useless. In addition, you have absolutely no ability to fathom the number of false bans and reports that are going to happen. Imagine if a YouTuber, such as, say, Technoblade hops on to Minecraft one day and sees that he has been banned from Minecraft because of that one time he said “Get destroyed, orphans” in a private server. Now, this is a bad example because it would be obvious that he would just be unbanned, but if this happens to every Minecraft YouTuber, which is absolutely possible and even likely, you are going to have an even angrier community on your hands. There are so many other ways that an ordinary player like me could get false banned. If I am on a PvP server, such as Hypixel, and I say to a guy in chat “I am going to murder you” it wouldn’t mean very much because that is normal in a PvP game. However, the moderation staff could and would take this the wrong way and ban me for threatening. I hope you can see the many flaws with this system. Unfortunately, false reports and bans are something that you cannot fix, it just happens. (This thread continues)</p>",

Banning should be a server to server implementation based upon the rules of the communities you are a part of. Global banning is unnecessary and way to harsh of a punishment for words. Its simple, you say something offensive to the community? Then good chances are that the moderators of those communities will remove you from the server. <br>Now maybe this feature could be implemented in such a way that If you get banned you would be put on a banlist. Then specific servers that want to choose to enable banlist-blacklisting will automatically prevent you from joining that particular server that you have never joined. But for private servers that could include anarchy servers, or your own server with friends banlist-blacklisting could opted out of and it wouldn't grab info from the banlist to blacklist people from joining that particular server. It would satisfy whatever 'safety' features microsoft is pushing and all of us who don't want to have this feature implemented. There is still the issue of this system being abused, which I don't know how to deal with. But as it stands, this feature is not good for anyone, and instills mistrust in communities.</p>",

Sure, I can see its place in Bedrock Edition servers that are official partners, but there are literally thousands of <strong>private</strong> servers on Java Edition. This is a feature that <strong>DOES NOT</strong> need to have \"perfect parity between versions.\" Java servers have had their own set of moderators for years upon years, why muscle into their role? I also don't believe it should be implemented in Realms as they're much smaller and invite-only. If a Realms player is misbehaving, let the owner of the Realm deal with them by taking them off the invite/whitelist. After all, they are the one paying for the server, it should be their right to decide what goes and what doesn't.</p>\n<p>On top of this, I'm incredibly worried about the fact that in some versions if you are banned from multiplayer, you are banned from your own, private, singleplayer worlds. This is completely outrageous, appalling, and outright unfair. A player should never have their access to their own private worlds (where by definition they can't hurt or insult anybody) for a game they paid for revoked.</p>\n<p>Mojang, please listen to the community and revoke/push back against this feature. I sincerely think this is terrible for Minecraft's overall health as it will inevitably alienate large parts of the player base by permanently banning innocent people just because someone abused the ban button as they had a bad day.

People have started to complain that Mojang is stealing their money and giving nothing in return. To change this issue maybe it would help to have a more player based tracking ban.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Meaning that your account has an overall score connecting to how many people have reported you.</p>\n<p>This not only could help with the wrongful bans but also give the Minecraft community some space to create mods/plugins that can further resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is they account users choice to join a server. It seems a little unfair that even though they chose to be exposed to the profanity/Harassment they still can be punished for it.&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>I am sure the community will find ways around the chat ban and your community has already done this.</p>\n<p>They are smart.

A larger Problem is the lack of context. Messages that can be highly offensive in public servers can be harmless or funny on private servers. Not every Minecraft player is a child and thus the general population should not be treated as such, especially on private servers, where all participants are usually aware of the server climate. Chat moderation or lack thereof on third-party servers should be left up to the respective admins, not a Mojang/Microsoft. You must be aware that this feature has the potential to kill communities, if not by the shear banning of the members, by the death of chat due the fear of a false ban. Please do not add this into the game. This will be disastrous.</p>",

Even ignoring the rules themselves, and the false reports the system will inevitably lead to, these changes will negatively impact the community. Forcing private servers to adhere to outside rules is nonsensical. The idea of a game company policing what adults have to say to each other on a private server is a violation of our privacy. Minecraft has always been shaped by the community and the complete freedom, modding, and private servers are what draw so many people to the game. I have been playing for over a decade now, and I think many people in my generation think of Minecraft not as a simple game but as a virtual world and a community we grew up in. This update goes against the freedom Minecraft stands for. Even though the chat report system can be circumvented with mods, it has no place in the vanilla game either. Don't ruin this beautiful game.</p>",

I’m also concerned that trolls will spam report people to get innocent people BANNED. Again, for over a decade we are still capable of Moderating our own Servers and creating our own rules. Mojang is clearly neglecting the community and are lying to us. They said “we accept feedback and want your opinion” etc, it is very clear no one wants this feature but hey let’s add it anyway. What happens if I’m playing Bedwars, skywars and someone is trash talking me then I say “sit down kid”, will I get banned for 999 days? Point is, Mojang either A, make this an option for the server hosts or B get rid of it all together. Thank you.</p>",

The ability to make your own little server or join servers made by other players is amazing. It was also amazing that it was community moderated, with the context being able to be known by people running the servers. Take 2b2t for example. It is an extremely popular server known for having almost no rules. if this feature is implemented the server will be broken, with the owner not being able to decide what happens&nbsp; with it. A server called \"E-Girl.mc\" might have someone say \"I'm gonna kill you\" and the moderator seeing that message and the server it came from might not know that it had factions or pvp game modes. I hope you take the time to revoke this feature. I hope Microsoft realizes they will lose a community of amazing people. Thank you for whoever reads this and takes it into consideration.</p>",
