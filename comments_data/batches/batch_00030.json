For example, we give it very fast and the sword is like it is stronger and that we can do tricks, I know that there is already that as a salute and that but I say that what I tell them they add as a type of training so that we are experts and Let's have a score for example we start from level 1 and we go to level 100 expert but it would be useful since we should be running attacking and grabbing parkur and when we are experts we can jump 6 blocks of one and run faster and than when we hit we give more force but we have that he continues training or we are going to drop to a level of 99.98.97.96.95 until we reach 1 again and that is my characteristic that I would like you to add THANK YOU.”&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Calibri; font-size: 11.0pt; color: black;\">- Translated by Admin&nbsp;</p>",

Adding in an ingredient you start the potion with which will change the water color. A redstone, glowstone, and spider eye performing the same functions so they cannot be base ingredients and starting with them results in a mundane or poison potion.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Unlike the brew stand though each result has two effects, one benefit, one drawback that takes effect after the benefit expires. So a Haste potion for 3 minutes followed by slowness for 3 minutes. I think this would allow for some effect potions early game, and make them more accessible than suspicious stew (where you have to secure enough mushrooms and then flowers).&nbsp; And having a drawback means you'll still want to use the brew stand. Honestly, they need to expand potions as it is to include more effects.</p>\n<p>Another neat idea I've seen via data packs is to use the Cauldron to mix potions, which saves on inventory space and you then have to strategize mixtures for various tasks. Time doesn't stack for the same effect but that honestly, getting more bang for the lost space is worth it.</p>",
