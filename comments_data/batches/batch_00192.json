It could be large islands similar to the End and there would be bridges made of obsidian and maybe a new kind of stone like Deepslate. They originally called it Grimstone so maybe this could be called Grimstone and be really hard to mine but make more durable tools like stone only double the durability.

I get the idea that you see it as a trap, but, once you've fell into it, you will always know there isn't anything interesting with this structure and players will quickly forget about it. This is my idea : Why not put a simple parkour for the player (to add a bit of excitement), leave the mob traps under this parkour challenge and, at the end, put a little treasure chamber with some loot in it. Now i have an idea for your \"Hortensia Fear\". The idea is great, but, it should have a limit : I was thinking that \"Hortensia Fear I\" should be able to scare mobs that are close to you. That means that range mobs such as skeletons should still be able to attack you from far. Now, if the treasure room had some loot, why not introduce a new item that could be used in a brewing stand and that, combined with \"Hortensia Fear I\" gives you \"Hortensia Fear II\" which should be strong enough to scare skeletons.</p>\n<p style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;  white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;\">Anyway, nice idea ;)</p>",
