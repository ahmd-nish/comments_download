One player could immediately go to the Nether searching for Soulsand Valley and destroy them all. Or over time, a server could essentially run out of dried ghasts in the same way elytras become rare in large servers. Mojang is making a big push for multiplayer right now (they have even named it \"Minecraft: play with friends\" on some platforms). If I had to guess, they are probably trying to figure out a good way to make elytras renewable as well.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It would be much easier to just make them breedable, but honestly I can't think of any way that would make sense lorewise. Maybe by crafting them out of Ghast Tears, you are imbuing the new ghastling with the remnants of the souls of other ghasts. A branch of magic straying into necromancy. The existence of Bone Blocks in the leaked recipe is the thing that really throws me off. I can't imagine how bone blocks would contribute to a Dried Ghast.</p>\n<p>One last thing I'll say is that I don't have many Ghast Tears lying around.
