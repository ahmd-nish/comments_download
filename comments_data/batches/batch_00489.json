The only restriction is only 2 could be placed in the world if you place a third the first one would despawn or break. Would be great for mining if you hooked it to your storage system or a bunch of chests in your base. Couldn't take stuff back out because it would be emptied by the hoppers but could go for a long time. Also for building if you put it under a storage silo for cobble or the other blocks you use and just be able to keep pulling until the silo is empty but then couldn't place into it because it would be kept full.
