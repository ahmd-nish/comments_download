It just runs to where they are and screams at them. Once the warden gets to where the player is, it appears it just stays there, screaming, even after the player walks away. I'm guessing that's to avoid players constantly being chased by a screaming warden since that wouldn't be very fun either.</p>\n<p>I can see where you're coming from with the idea of a \"safe mode\", but what else would you change? I'm not a fan of changing Peaceful Mode substantially since that's the main way I play. I like gathering, exploring, and building. I don't mind being scared, otherwise I wouldn't go anywhere near lava. I just don't like fighting at all and have no desire to fight mobs ever.</p>\n<p>Edit: And of course the day after I submit this comment, they release a snapshot that stops the Warden from spawning in peaceful lol</p>",

I think it should drop about 3-4 chunks and then you smelt them in a furnace for a shorter timer per chunk. Normally smelting/cooking something would take 8 seconds, but I think it should take 6-7 seconds in a normal furnace and in a blast furnace that would be 2-3 seconds. This would decrease the amount of time waiting for the small chunks to smelt while still having to wait awhile for all the chunks to smelt.</p>",

The flowers you use replace the yellow ones on the wildflowers (with dandelions just basically being the same as they are right now) in their respective quadrants of the 1x1 space they're placed on.</p>\n<p>Considering there are several other blocks, items, and entities that also have a plethora of purely aesthetic variations, such as armor with armor trims, banners and their various patterns, or leather armor and their ability to be dyed to more than just the basic 16 colors, I don't think this would be particularly difficult to make happen, and for me personally, would make wildflowers one of the most fun decoration-focused items in the game.</p>",
