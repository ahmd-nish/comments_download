An alien who was disguised as a human scientist found it on the ground in front of a launch center. Like the Arch-Illeger, he wasn't allowed in. He got corrupted by his greed and desired revenge! He took over the launch center, making everybody there into zombie scientist, that only work for him! He was a nice guy even for an alien, but there's no going back now...</p>\n<p>The Shard Tracker showed that a shard was over by the lab on another island, however... the tracker soon loses track of the shard. So you go over there to find a launch center. You realize that the shard went into space. However, you quickly find out that there are zombie scientists here. Whether you want to sneak around or attack is your choice. Once you get to the control panel, you turn on the launch sequence and race to the rocket before it launches.</p>\n<p>It seems like the course for the rocket was heading towards the I.S.S. You head there only to find out that it's been corrupted by the alien. The Astro-mobs await you, and they're NOT happy. It seems like the shard is not here, so to prevent the Astro-mobs from getting to earth, you turn on self-destruct mode, and rush to the escape pods.</p>",

Doing it like that would mean that people who are very busy and dont have much time to play the event, have a better chance to get hold of the uniques they wanted. I'd also like to see some uniques be unique to levels since thats intresting and provides a variety of different challenges for players. Also a difficulty slider would be appreciated, as we all want high level gear without having to break the bank at the blacksmith upgrading everything. Finally, some more truly 'unique' items would be nice, ones with different effects, rather than a re-skin of previous items. I understand that reskins are good because it means that players have a chance to have practically the same gear as those who took the event trials, and not put the 'event people' at an advantage. However, some seasonal effects might be nice to provide some motive to get rarer pieces of gear. ( for example : mobs glow in night mode). Thanks for reading :)</p>",

Speaking of, I believe it would be interesting to see custom limited-time levels for each season (e.g. a Halloween event where the level is a graveyard theme, with a giant skeleton as a final boss or something.) Or, kinda like what the past event was, levels that relate to the holiday can have alternate trials with new bosses or mobs to fight (e.g. Frosted Fjord is decorated in a Christmas style and has a Grinch or some other evil entity as a boss. Maybe some mobs can wear Santa hats.)</p>",
