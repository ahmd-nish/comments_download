My main idea is could you label everything&nbsp; in a hidden&nbsp; sub menu or something so we can easily notify what the item is along with working on keyboard navigation. I&nbsp; normally use the arrow keys&nbsp; as the normal character movement, space bar to jump up, tab&nbsp; for eith a toggle or like a dash button. I have been trying to figure out how to do it myself but not really good at coding, just would like to see minecraft to be more accessible for completely blind people and other people who need accessible&nbsp; help. So in otherwords can you make the keyboard with jaws do everything a mouse can do without it being clunky?</p>",

I imagine these settings to be sliders, just like the FOV and brightness settings for example, with the middle position being the default setting, sliding it to the right would make the setting more extreme,(faster, more, harder, etc.)while sliding it to the left would make it less extreme(slower, less, easier).</span></span></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\">I think there should be an option to quickly set all settings back to default, an option to save a combination of settings with a name, and also an option to load saved settings, and maybe also some pre-made setting combinations. If these settings could be saved per individual world, that would be great. This way, you could set yourself different challenges in different gameplay worlds, and servers as well.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>",
