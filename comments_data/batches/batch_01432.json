With the second name of the spider being revealed - Trapdoor Spider - the animation for hiding can resemble closing and opening of a trapdoor. I guess, it could be hard to pull out with my idea of having a block being stuck to your shield, so I have a solution. Your shield (so is the behind of the spider) can just mimic the texture of a block you are on. And when you or the spider hide under or jumps out the ground, the sound of a closing\\opening trapdoor could play.</p>\n<p>It could be a fun addition to spice the gameplay up a bit - making you scared of trapdoor sounds. Imagine walking around your world and hearing the unexpected opening sound of a trapdoor in the middle of the woods or by your excavation site... Jesus...</p>\n<p>And in addition to the mimicking - if you don't want the shield to be too OP, you can make that the unique texture of the shield would still be active with the camouflage mod on. But a loud sound of an opening\\closing trapdoor is a hard nerf by itself, so for smart multiplayer players, the sound would be enough to know, that another player is near them.</p>",
