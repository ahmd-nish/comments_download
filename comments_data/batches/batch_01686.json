Finished half of its health on Hard difficulty and would have continued if it wasn’t for a massive amount of lag, not having a Smite sword, getting myself trapped in Bedrock all the time and having my milk and potions blown up since I didn’t close the walls of my obsidian room. I switched it to Easy on the second half, and it was almost nothing; it wouldn’t have been fair to deal with withering with the massive amount of lag I hadI would have kept it on Normal at least if it wasn’t for all of the tragedies I mentioned. I didn’t even trap it under bedrock. My point is, it’s incredibly hard, but it’s not impossible, I only tuned the difficulty down cause the fight unexpectedly messed up. I think the way it is on Bedrock should be how hard it is; the game is already really easy and the Bedrock Wither is one of the only things that make up for that, that’s provided you don’t cheese it like most people do. It heavily depends on difficulty and strategy. I just made it hard and even unfair for myself by starting on Hard and spawning it right above Bedrock, but I still managed to survive and kill it legitimately.</p>",

I mean, its a piece of cake despite the wither effect if you have full netherite with prot. It gets that easy to beat it that i wait to go down to two hearts to play with it and then heal back to full by spamming golden apples and just, its a piece of cake. Just use a decent sword and bow, as much golden apples as you need, perhaps a strength 2 potion and/or health potions and you're pretty much set, you can't die as long as you remember to heal with golden apples. For the people experiencing lag, a huge tip: turn off tile drops in settings and it will not lag. Don't use milk buckets as they are just not worth it and clog up your inventory: use golden apples or optionally, regen potions. And you also dont need an obsidian cube as i have seen players who do that: its unnecessary in short. My preferred conditions are: 50 to 64 golden apples, a sharpness 5 netherite sword, full prot 4 netherite with thorns 2, a power 5 bow with infinity. Have that and you're pretty much set.</p>",

If this is the case, I don't think it makes sense, but one block swimming is needed and the smooth running transition. So much more fun getting through water.</p>",

If you go up slowly, you get caught right under the surface but still can't breathe.

Being able to add a compass to a plain map via a cartography table (as in bedrock edition) would provide more uses for that cartography table.</p>\n<p>Locator maps provide an edge when navigating, but plain maps allow for a different and equally enjoyable experience. Navigating by a non-locator-map encourages the player to get familiar with landmarks, and use other tools like the sky or sunflowers to orient themselves, much like real world orienteering.</p>\n<p>At time of writing, compass functionality is being updated via the lodestone block, and it seems like a natural moment to integrate compasses into the cartography table for the sake of version parity and for the enjoyment of budding cartographers and orienteers everywhere!</p>",

Here are some features that are in bedrock but not in Java, tipped arrows can be made with a cauldron, blocks can be placed in front of you, trash farms, you have to shift to block a shield, I can’t think of anymore, so do you still think Java edition is unfair?</p>",
