Now, this then leads to more questions, are villagers descendants of the ancient civilization or are zombies as some sort of necromancy attempt to survive? Did this civilization develop magic and technology to travel into other dimensions (future dimensions) that just weren't as interesting to them (unlike the nether were there is ancient debri marking something they were doing.)</p>\n<p>And are strongholds the footholds of the end civilization ergo explaining why they are centered on the dragon's island and different than ancient cities?
