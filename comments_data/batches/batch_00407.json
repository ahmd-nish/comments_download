There are only one tropical fish mob and one bucket of tropical fish, but every one of them has an entity data called variant, storing the size, the pattern, the colour and the colour of the pattern. <br><br>So my suggestion is to add a colour entity data for water, it could be a simple RGB value generated from the biome. When you fill a bucket with that water, the value is kept in the bucket, so when you empty it, the new water source maintains its original colour. No need for new blocks, new names nor filling any creative tab with types of water!<br><br>This also gives me a cool idea that mapmakers would love: through commands, you could obtain a water bucket of any colour you want, so you could have some red-water representing blood (or a high-iron water), green for toxic waste and acid... If an alpha could be added to this RGB value, the possibilities would be endless: you could have an opaque black petroleum and also crystalline water.<br><br>Something similar could be done with leaves and grass, but then they will not stack in the inventory, and that doesn't sound great to me... Maybe a new enchantment like silk touch that also maintains the colour? I don't know.</p>",

For example, I like the way grass looks in the savanna biome, but when you put grass in the plains biome it just turns back to its usual bright green color. You could also be able to mix different grass blocks of slightly different shades to create more detail in the landscape, just like in real life.</p>\n<p>You could also put a gradient in the block if it is placed directly next to another type of grass block, so you don't have that abrupt change of one texture to another.</p>\n<p>You could also do a similar thing with the leaf blocks.</p>\n<p>Swamp water would also be nice. If you scoop up a bucket of water from the swamp, then dump it in a different biome, it should be the same color. I hope you add this feature to the game in the future, Mojang.

It would change color and its stats would get better. For example, a freshly crafted copper sword does four damage points. Once it starts to oxidize, it does five, then six. This would create an incentive to use up the tools.</p>\n<p>-In a thunderstorm, all copper gear would become \"storm charged\" and be even more powerful. A storm charged copper sword would have something similar to the channeling enchantment, summoning lightning to damage enemies. (As others have said, copper gear would also increase your chances of being struck by lightning. Risk and reward!)</p>\n<p>Hope this gets implemented and gives y'all something to do with your copper stashes! :)</p>",

It's everywhere, there's different methods to do it, and almost every culture on this planet has some form of aspect to it. Currently, minecraft has five different means to prepare food which is by a furnace to cook a stack, a smoker to cook a stack faster, shooting a flamed arrow to cook food instantly, crafting 3 or 4 items in a crafting bench to make something more grainy, and the most interesting one, a campfire which can cook up to 6 different things at once, if applicable. However, this new form of expression would make for a great addition to the game.</p>\n\n<p>With the use of a caldroun, filled with either a bucket of water or milk, on top of a heat source like fire or lava, you can make your own soups! Add steak? Add carrots? Add mushrooms? Add potion effects by adding their respective potion? You name it!</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and also make identical soups stackable like they did with buckets. </p>",
