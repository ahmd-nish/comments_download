I disagree that introducing a random factor to the system would help. If we can make it less easy, I prefer that we change bonemealing ALL tall flowers to produce their own respective seeds (including the original 4). That way it's still accessible and reliable, although more effort is needed to maintain the production line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'd go for the same chance with Sniffer breeding...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, them dropping an egg is a perfect approach like how the turtles do.</p>",
