And have some ideas, so here is what my post was going to be:</p>\n<p>I was playing some Minecraft and I showed my dad our epic little town and he said \"where's the pigeon loft?\" Adding homing/messenger/wild pigeons would be an interesting and cool addition I think. We \"tame\" pigeons in the real life, I think some real life characteristics of them could be added. They could eat seeds/food/mob drops off the ground, you could train them to always return home (they do this in real life!), you could add a sort of scroll item so you could send messages to other players (or just do it with the pre-existing book and quill), you can breed them into different color patterns, they capture other pigeons into their flock, if you also add hawks that could be a predator like the untamed wolves are to sheep (hawks also eat chickens), and they could serve as another source of getting feathers! There are other characteristics that could be added: pigeons always lay 2 eggs (a male and female), they naturally drop their feathers, that's all I can think of right now. Adding pigeons would be awesome, and you could eat them!&nbsp;</p>",

In the back end of the ships, there will be a cage with the “Endolotl” in it. You could add a new item called the “End Bucket” and to create it you need 3 pieces of Endstone. Then you collect the Endolotl and there you have it! It would give you more of a thrill if the End city has a ship in it. Can you please add it to PE edition? Thanks!</p>",

So we haven’t been able to find a fortress yet because all we do is fight off one mob or another. I wear a gold helmet but still hoglins attack me. The mobs are saturating my new realm and respawn continuously as if ultra hard mode or something, so we never get a break to just explore or mine resources.   </p>",
