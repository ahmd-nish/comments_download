I think it should be 9 blaze rods making a block. Since 9 blaze rods smelt 108 items this new blaze rod block should smelt 120 blocks being the best fuel source in the game. This would incentive more people to make a blaze farm which most players currently neglect. Once you beat the game blaze rods are kinda useless. Their a medium tier smelting source. If we could make them into a block like how the block of coal is more efficient than it’s parts and stackable blaze rods would be a worthwhile fuel source.</p>",

But my suggested usage is it grants a status effect similar to wearing a Turtle Shell, granting Absorption and Mining Fatigue. But the countdown timer of the effect won't start until they receive an attack, similar to the Bad Omen and Hero of the Village effect. The timer starts to tick and will have a duration for 10 seconds. The buff will return if they have not received direct damage for 20 seconds. Since it grants tankiness, it should have low durability. Can be enchanted with Unbreaking and Mending.<br><br>Maybe also add a chance to make them drop Bracer Straps too. This can be used to craft the Bracer. But it shouldn't be easy to make. I propose adding a new alloy like material called Steel to complement Netherite. Steel Ingots are made first by combining 4 Iron Ingots and 4 Coal to make Raw Steel then smelted in a Furnace (or Blast Furnace) to make a single Steel Ingot. You can use this Steel to make the Bracer. 3 Gold Ingots (Top Row), 3 Steel Ingots (Middle Row), 2 Bracer straps (1 strap, BLANK, 1 strap).&nbsp;</p>",
