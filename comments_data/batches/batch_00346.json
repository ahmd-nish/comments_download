Combine the box with a minecart<br>2. Place minecart on a rail with hoppers above the rail<br>3. Minecart travels back and forth under the line of hoppers containing redstone components.<br>4. Shulker box is restocked by the variety of different components in said hoppers.<br>5. Once done the minecart and shulker box are dropped as separate items and shulker box is restocked.<br>6. Profit?<br><br>That's just one of many applications this could possible be used for, we don't need additional features, the fact that shulker boxes retain inventory when dropped is already powerful enough.</p>",
