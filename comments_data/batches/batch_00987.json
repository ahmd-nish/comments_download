If you keep attacking the player as fast as you can, it’s possible for them to pretty much fly making it impossible to reach you becuse low ground is better then high ground. Making vertical knockback higher would mean that it’s easier to do this. When your in the air you can’t do anything,this has happend to me many times. I think to improve pvp you need to reduce knockback and maybe do what java is doing with sprint resetting in 1.8. Knockback is too strong, where in sky wars I try to run away from the edge of the island but the knockback is stronger then my running speed. This makes no sense so knockback would be nerfed. Also combos on controller are too hard too do, unless you can always keep your curser on the player at all times.</p>",

We need an actual inventory expansion, it has not been expanded since before even Notch left the game development team. The inventory should be expanded by 1 bar.</p>\n\n<p>   Instead of the backpack idea, we could have a new chestplate enchantment that would also add more reason to use a chestplate over an elytra.</p>\n\n<p>   This enchantment would be called expanding, it would have one level (like mending), it would increase you’re inventory space by another bar, so 2 extra bars of inventory space would be possible, 1  by default, and one with a new enchantment.</p>\n\n<p>   This would add more reason to use a chestplate over an elytra, since quite literally no one ever uses a chestplate instead of an elytra these days, and also would solve the inventory issue, and a new enchantment, and increase the default inventory space as well. With so many new blocks being added, and even more with the upcoming Wild update and the future archeology update, this would be a great way to give players more space for items, unlike the bundle, or backpacks, this is not just an early game solution, you have the default extra inventory bar, and for players later into the game, they can get even more storage with the Expanding enchantment.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Just a brief continuation, but I wanted to further develop the last point on the effects it would bring back. Making items that don't have many uses currently into potion ingredients is an easy way to make them feel more valuable. Some of the items I think would work for these missing effects are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Ink Sac &gt; Blindness</strong> (ink sac's 1 use currently is to be made into Black Dye. Keeping it as the organ for a potion recipe fits the theme of brewing nicely. As for mobs, their line of sight would be dropped to 0-2 blocks for the duration of the effect)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Rotten&nbsp;Flesh &gt; Nausea</strong> (Rotten Flesh becomes useless the moment you have any other food and just takes up space. This at least takes the gross concept of ingesting flesh a comical context. When used on a mob, the mob will generally act dizzy and confused. Skeletons may miss their shots completely and creepers may accidentally explode.).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Bottle of Honey &gt; Haste</strong> (Currently, Honey is only used as a food and a block ingredient. Making honey the key ingredient for Haste potions, mimicking being as busy as a bee, would make bee farms much more valuable. On mobs, this would increase their attack speed. With fermented spider eyes, this would become a mining fatigue potion, having the same effect on mobs.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for the ingredient I mentioned earlier in the post that would increase the duration the cream remains on the weapon, I think it should be <strong>Nether&nbsp;</strong><strong>Quartz</strong>. On instantaneous effects, it would add an extra usage before disappearing.</p>",

Also, there could be an explosion, as if a powerful force hit the block, which could do further damage to any walls or dirt pillars unprepared players might try. This would allow late game players with a respectable amount of obsidian to more easily trap the warden behind a wall or even kill it by shooting it with arrows through a small hole, whereas an early game player or speedrunner would be punished hard for trying the iron golem trick with some dirt blocks on the warden, a late game mob.</p>",
