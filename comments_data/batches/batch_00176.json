If they added an ore, I think it can be an additive for any armor type when if you get to low health or something, it teleports you away from the mobs that put you that low of health. Giving you time to heal. And yes. Leaving the end empty is preferred. But with limited lushness. Rare lush biomes. And update the terrain to have more verticality and add 1 or two more structures with different rare loot</p>",

The idea of few lush biomes and could even add end versions of villagers/piglins in lively end citys, they could even add fallen end ships with broken elytra instead of regular for more  variety. Also End armor could be an alternative to netherite being the same way applied to diamond with an \"endite smithing upgrade\" and \"endite\" ingots but do diffrent things. The netherite being bulky and as said by the original poster, the end one could teleport you but is less powerful.</p>",
