It took years to add dual support on the oculus so I doubt you'll see it in the PSVR version any time soon.\" There's also a YouTube video on the matter link <a href=\"https://video.search.yahoo.com/search/video;_ylt=A2KLfSuQK1pgyGMAgKJXNyoA;_ylu=Y29sbwNiZjEEcG9zAzEEdnRpZANDMTYxNF8xBHNlYwNzYw--?p=motion+controllers+minecrfat+psvr&amp;type=E211US105G0&amp;ei=UTF-8&amp;fr=mcafee&amp;turl=https%3A%2F%2Ftse3.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOVP.R_qQnnStJC4h1uqf_TE1wgEsDh%26pid%3DApi%26w%3D148%26h%3D78%26c%3D7&amp;rurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D2MkWg6W_MNw&amp;tit=Why+Doesn%27t+Minecraft+PSVR+Have+Motion+Controller+Support%3F&amp;pos=1&amp;vid=02479d2e379054bec13bc83949381afe&amp;sigr=JCUWW4uj7b5n&amp;sigt=gvk4FxX1uar7&amp;sigi=bQuMspPt409.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.

I'd like to make the switch over from Java to Bedrock, because it looks arguably better, has controller support if you want it, and performs enormously better than Java edition. But the double-tap to sprint feature will go off on its own, without even lifting my finger off of the W key. It happens mostly when I strafe left and right a lot, which I <strong>have</strong> to do, <em>a lot</em>. For people who use it, fantastic. More power to you. But I want the option to disable the feature. Control to sprint is (no pun intended) actually controllable. Double-tap to sprint is <strong>broken and unstable</strong>, and players need the option to disable it on PC.</p>\n<p>Edit: It turns out that double-tapping <em>any&nbsp;</em>direction on WASD while moving forward will make you sprint. Feathering the strafe keys or backpedalling should <em>never&nbsp;</em>make you sprint. This is what made it appear as if it was sprinting on its own. Try it for yourself. Hold W and double-tap A or S or D and you will start sprinting. Does that make any sense? Give us the option already.</p>",

I would much rather my analog stick be a normal stick, the constant go stop go with the sprint when i dont even want to sprint is very unintuitive and forces me to play a very specific way, like im walking on eggshells all the time. I would like to move around as much as I'd like without the worry. I play on PlayStation 4, please please please add this!! Complete rebind and toggle would make this a more comfortable and enjoyable experience for me. Thank you</p>",

But the advantage of having them saved there is that if you delete minecraft gooogle still saves the application data like your worlds. if you wish to move worlds from external to application, just go to games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds find the world folder and change it to an mcworld file (find out how to do that in my post above) then go back into minecraft change your file storage location from external to application then import the .mcworld.</p>",

        "body": "<p>My thoughts: checkboxes to choose which biomes you want. Maybe each biome and all of its variants can either be selected all together or separately such as ‘All Oceans’ or just ‘Lukewarm Ocean’. Then with each biome add a percentage slider for customisation, for example 10% Ocean; 20% Savannah; 20% Jungle; 10% Desert; 20% Mesa; 10% Plains; 10% Mountains. \n<br />Lastly, I believe it would be nice to customise structures. For example, because Desert Temples are not too uncommon, it would make sense to be able to choose their generation rate to prevent them from spawning too often in a world of only a few biomes. </p>\n\n<p>Not only would this make it seriously easy to build in certain biomes and take on challenges such as desert survival, but it would also allow the player to fully customise the scenery if they were building a map or just playing regular survival but without their least favourite biomes. I personally am a fan of this, sounds great to me. </p>",

While this is possible, I think it shouldn't be necessary to go edit the settings file to change a setting, when it could easily be incorporated into the game's settings screen. Most of the bedrock playerbase is young and would probably not go through the trouble of finding and editing the settings file.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ingame toggle should be implemented asap, because it is a very useful quality of life feature that is also incredibly easy to implement. Why force limit the framerate and introduce tons of input latency by making vsync default to on? It has to be assumed that most people will have low end hardware, and for them, vsync only makes gameplay incredibly unenjoyable.</p>\n<p>The setting already exists, the default layout for toggles already exists, all that has to be done is to add the toggle element to the settings next to \"improved input response\".</p>",

While my friends on Xbox and Nintendo Switch have default toggle sneak making it much easier to play. I am used to Java so switching to Bedrock threw me for a loop, and I often forget I am unable to press sneak once and then move on. This is an issue most commonly come across while exploring The End. You virtually HAVE to bridge across gaps of 100+ blocks while holding sneak which often gives me finger cramps or ruins the gaming experience for me. Just today, while exploring with my friends and attempting to finish a bridge for one of them, my finger slipped off the sneak key for just a second and I went pummeling to my death, over 10 hours of work and grinding all gone, because I had to hold the same key down for over 2 minutes. Please add this to the game, players have been requesting this for months and I feel that adding a \"toggle\" or \"hold\" option for the sneak key-bind in Minecraft Windows 10 edition is the most logical next step.</p>",

It is important, Xbox allows you to do it if you have the disk, so PlayStation 4/5 should have the same. The better together was so that everyone could experience Minecraft no matter the console they’re on, so it would make sense that we should still be able to play this older version, I’m not even asking that they continue to update it. I’m just asking to keep a version running that is still running, and that many people still enjoy. Why would they take away this? For bedrock? So many people dislike bedrock, that’s why I play the older version on Xbox, or but it doesn’t have the same updates as on the ps4. I play Java too, but as someone who doesn’t want to and won’t pay thousands for a PC, it is hard because my game cannot run as well as it would on my console. It was a stupid decision to remove the classic version in the first place, smh.</p>",

Remap the controls to not use R2 L2, like I set to mine with L1, jump with X, place block with up on dpad and left and right to scroll threw hot keys. I've tried with using R1 for something but it won't map to anything. Another thing the menu will show that L1 is mapped to xbox Y but this isn't the case but you won't be able map ds4 circle for some reason.</p>\n<p>One more thing. I noticed that some phones ds4 controllers will work on but others it won't <br>but will still connect with Bluetooth for example my oppo ax5s works but my missus newer oppo won't... Strange considering how mine was released at the beginning of the year while hers was towards the end.</p>\n<p>Second last thing.. if you have a Samsung just jailbreak it and there is a ds4 controller app you can buy that will make the controller work perfectly. I've done this on many models and it maps the ds4 controller fine with Minecraft. The reason I got oppo tho.. I kept breaking may Samsung at work. <br>Really hope this helped someone</p>",

I can in retrospect understand why it might not be, for size issues, but this information is not readily apparent or easy to discover, particularly given the implications of a music volume slider suggesting the presence of music. </p>\n\n<p>Well okay, so I go to the store to try to find it, </p>\n\n<p>searching \"music\" gave no results, \"original\" gave no results, </p>\n\n<p>I joined the Minecraft discord to see if there was any info, found mostly people responding to my identical question with, \"have you tried ~this reddit post~?\", whereas the reddit post they would link contained no relevant information, </p>\n\n<p>googled more, </p>\n\n<p>FINALLY found someone suggesting to yet another person with my same question to filter by \"creator: minecraft\", and near the end of those results I finally, finally found the music pack. </p>\n\n<p>Overall, this was unexpected, and needlessly arcane and difficult to execute.</p>",

I love vanilla and it has a place in game play but as far as UI control and user ease of use goes its lagging behind all the mods. something like inventory tweaks seem simple enough to add to the base game even though it would be better if in the base game it didn't virtually drag and drop each item like the mod does. In my opinion the inventory sorting/block dragging should go along side a increase in max block stack sizes especially for items limited to stacks of 16.</p>",

Swiping up twice makes you sprint but something tells me this doesn't seem as easy as it sounds.</p>\n<p>I wonder if a joystick<em> shaped like an upside down generic keyhole</em>&nbsp;would work. The round part is the normal joystick for walking, and the attached wedge part (which would extend upwards and diagonally) is the sprinting part, and it works as&nbsp;a visual indicator for sprinting. There should be some resistance when moving up towards the wedge so you don't accidentally sprint, so it&nbsp;requires more intentional and prominent movement of the finger for the&nbsp;stick to move into the wedge to start sprinting.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>I was thinking of suggesting this myself too lol, anyways,</p>\n<p>instead of making the crouch button a double tap in the center of the joystick, how about putting the crouch button next to the jump button (maybe in the style of SNES, for the little bit of extra touch). Another good change would be to make sure that it’s an option rather than a forced change, for obvious reasons. Speaking of the options, what about, if the joystick option is enabled, You can decide if it follows your finger or is locked to where the D-Pad would be.</p>\n<p>Some might say that a Joystick would go against the blocky nature of Minecraft, so why not make the joystick pixelated? Theres many things to consider when making a joystick (especially for Minecraft) like the joystick pixelation, how big it’ll be compared to the D-Pad, or dead-zones. But overall, it’d be a small, yet, big QoL change to Minecraft Mobile users.</p>",
