It's easy to notice this in any map flying up and looking at the edge: you see perfectly for 90% of the screen then there's a really step fog that grays out into nothing only at the very edge.</p>\n<p><br>This approach isn't ideal as it doesn't help with perspective and doesn't imitate the real world were atmosphere does whiten up farther objects, make them less saturated etc. Check out articles on <strong>atmospheric perspective</strong> to get what I mean.</p>\n<p>Implementing a fog slider would work like this: with 0 you have literally no fog, all is visible till the edge of the render, increasing values stretch the fog from render edge to your current position, say 50 would mean halfway to you position, with 100 fog starts literally from you nose.</p>\n<p>This won't affect much current gameplay if you implement the fog <strong>linearly</strong> increasing from starting point&nbsp;to the edge, so even with 100 setting the first chunks will look the same but halfway trough it will be much more&nbsp;noticeable, farther it will even hide things and blend to the border.</p>",

I need to play with the Extra large GUI which is fine for the most part. The issue is with the size of the hot bar “ item description” and the length of time it takes to dissappear.

(Until they fix this, I found a quick fix if you're interested. If you have a keyboard with a macro program, you can set your inventory key to some unused key, and set a macro on your tab key to press whatever unused key you bind your inventory to. For instance I have a Razer keyboard and have a macro using Razer Synapse to make my tab key press P. Which allows me to use tab to open and close my inventory. Really hope they fix this though.)</p>",

The change to the visual design is okay, but the hotbar stayed the same making it look inconsistent. Between the old and new ones, I prefer the old visual design. The real deal-breaker is the changes to functionality. The default locations of the jump and movement buttons was moved away from edges of the screen, which is makes them uncomfortable to reach for. The ability to customize the location of the buttons is cool, but I'll never get them exactly where they were. My 2 biggest complaints are with the flight mode buttons and hotbar, though. The button for descending and exiting flight mode used to be in the same relative location as the jump button, but it was moved to be below it, leaving an empty space between it and the ascend button. This change really messes with my muscle memory; I always instinctually tap in between the new flight buttons because that was where the button used to be. I also want to mention the hotbar. It doesn't look any different, but it feels a lot less sensitive. For some reason, it doesn't register when I tap it directly and instead it places a block, which is really annoying. It only selects if you only tap the lower half of it. It's really annoying.</p>\n<p>TL;DR, the new D-pad controls are a total downgrade. If you're not going to scrap them entirely, I'd at least like it if you added a classic control mode that brings the old controls and defaults back.</p>",

Counterintuitively, the 3-D-looking designs of the new D-pad and other controls feel worse to use than the 2-D-looking old ones. The implied depth of the new buttons causes confusion about where the boundaries of the buttons are. Is it just the flat \"front\" of the button that registers input, or is it the entire icon? The flat, sharply defined edges of the old buttons didn't have this problem. In general, I don't like the visual design changes that the game has been receiving, and I think they remove some of the game's original charm.</p>",
