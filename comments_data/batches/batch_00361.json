The clay trade that the mason has (only in Java), as well as the upcoming piglin gravel barter, are trades that are rather late-game and resource intensive to obtain compared to what you get from them.

If Mojang wanted to do that, then they are free to do so, but they do not have to. Lava would still have to be placed, turned into obsidian and then mined.
