It's like a no-brianer to me to be able to use the spyglass for ranged weapons. I really hope this gets more votes, I was going to suggest this then I found your suggestion. I havent played the beta yet so i dont know exactly how the spyglass works but maybe when you hold the spyglass in your offhand and aim a crossbow or bow your spyglass would automatically engage zooming in and allowing better aim. Of cource when the spyglass is removed from offhand no zoom effect when aiming as usuall.</p>",

The damage would start when it reaches the last red heart to the left. this would make sense as a player already having damage would succumb to hypothermia quicker. Additionally, as the blue hearts collect a slight slowing effect like when hungry would be a good indicator you are freezing over.&nbsp;</span></p>",
