        "body": "<p>I agree, the lack of similar accessibility tools in Bedrock compared to Java is what keeps me from playing Bedrock.&nbsp; Minecraft is a great family friendly game in many ways, but Java is more so since it has more accessibility options for people with physical challenges. This will only get more pronounced as the gaming community ages.&nbsp; Having the toggle for Sprint and Sneak is great for folks with hand/wrist problems.&nbsp; The visual toggles are fantastic for folks with sight and perception problems.&nbsp; Both of these problems become more pronounced as people age.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br></p>\n<p>The more accessibility, the more the game appeals to a broader player base.&nbsp; That will increase your game sales which is the goal of any company.&nbsp; This is particularly important as it appears that Bedrock is getting more and more features which puts it in a position to eliminate Java edition entirely.&nbsp; I know if that does happen and Bedrock doesn't get these accessibility features I'm not going to be able to play the game anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
