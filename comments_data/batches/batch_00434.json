Diamond is important because although it's not quite as rare in the late game, it's still rarer than most other things... plus, tools and armor can break. They need to be able to replace them if they do.</p>\n<p>And theirs only ONE Dragon Egg in the entire game. You can only get it the first time beating the Ender Dragon. Being a trophy is it's purpose... especially since it would suck even more if it had an actual use and you ended up losing it.</p>\n<p>(Although... I don't think Beacons should be able to use iron or gold to power it up. And it should have a time limit for how long it lasts before you need to recharge it again... iron and gold should still be usable for the pyramid though).</p>\n<p>By that logic Netherite has no utility.

They can add a new plant for a new potion in the swamp as well as swamp temples that could be made of stone and crying obsidian with hints towards how the potion system works (chest with potion ingredients and farms of nether wart) for the player to find. The staffs are a little more far fetched of an idea, but I think that the new amethyst clusters could be used as part of the system. So you would find a dull staff as part of the swamp temple loot and you would have to give it a level 30 enchantment called \"casting\" before it was useful. Once enchanted you would surround a amethyst cluster with the splash potions of the effect you want (in a crafting table) and you would get a unique crystal based off that effect, which could then be combined with the enchanted staff to make a ranged magical weapon. This would all add more functionality to the amethyst and add an alternative to netherite swords and axes for combat. This would all go great with the expected future swamp update.</p>",

The idea is that of the map either square or round in the upper part of our screen and that has the option to configure it to move it, mark geographical points (you know sometimes you are going to explore and the inventory is filled) also that when you die a skull or something like that will appear on the minimap as well as the detection of hostile mobs with red dot and passive mobs with blue or green or configuration of whoever you want. Also the expansion of it in case it is required to observe the map Would be everything I would like to share with you have created an excellent game eh played since the first versions in the pocket edition and I loved its development until today but I always eh believed that that aspect would be super great and the truth if it would serve in advance I thank you for your attention and many congratulations for the creation so perfect of the game on all its platforms I've played it on all and it fascinates me. Another little thing would be great that they re-launched Minecraft History Mod was super great and had good development I still have it on my xbox but I would like to have it on my cell phone also thank you very much for your attention I hope you take the trouble to read my little request and I wish you luck and I will continue waiting for the 2 part of Caves and Cliffs</p>",
