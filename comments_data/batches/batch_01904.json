The goals for this change is \"to utilise more diamonds within progression\" and \"make netherite more of an accomplishment\" both possible ways to get the item can easily be achieved without using any diamond tools whatsoever, heck it would be cheaper to do so without diamonds. and I'm very sure holding down left click for 4 hours is a grand accomplishment. Having netherite be behind a combat goal instead of a test of patience really utilises since having better tools and armour actually means life or death in combat.</p>\n<p>there are a few things I am against in this suggestion though, piglin brutes should not have the netherite axe because that gives the player a free netherite axe and the brute is already pretty powerful afaik. The recipe also is a bit annoying since the wither skulls should be used on the wither itself. Perhaps you could use some other nether drop for it? The one that comes to mind for me are ghast tears since they are quite challenging to get without losing them in the lava.</p>\n<p>I really hope mojang listens to your idea.</p>",

A plank though is easier to craft but limited in movement and ammo, though it can actually cause damage and fire a variety of shots (Arrows, potions, tridents). With the Warp and Crimson able to shoot fire charges and fireworks. Then just beef up the snow with a little more knock back and maybe a means to keep it form melting by it being on ice blocks, which then could also be use as path mechanic in hotter climates for them.</p>",

It's a quasi-science only the player unlocks, which is a similar thing to brewing and enchanting,&nbsp; it doesn't seem utilized by other mobs oddly like it's a lost skill, but then there is also no in-game reason why the player would gain this knowledge. Now realistically this is probably because Minecraft is constantly growing, though they do try hard to not overwrite previous mechanics with new additions, so it's more like always refinding new knowledge.&nbsp;</p>",
