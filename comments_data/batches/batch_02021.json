Quite the undertaking.&nbsp;<br><br>Having a woodcutter villager selling chests, planks, saplings and logs would be an incredible asset to my world. Higher tier trades could even include campfires or rarer leaf-types.&nbsp;<br><br>I would also like a villager that I could sell off the large amount of iron axes that I assemble from trading with tool-smiths and weapon-smiths. A woodcutter needs axes, but lets not break the economy by allowing the player to buy an axe from one villager just to trade it to another for your emeralds back. I suggest: Sell an axe *and* some emeralds to a woodcutter for a handful of logs.&nbsp;<br><br>I'm not a fan of restricting wood-types to be biome specific, but instead should be a random roll. This way village management can include shuffling your woodcutter to get the trades you want, like other professions.&nbsp;<br><br>TL;DR: Wood is hard to automate, and I would love to buy it with emeralds.</p>",

Not necessarily the more modern fantasy one of today but the classical Scandinavian trolls, particularly the nocturnal giants from Norwegian, Swedish, and Icelandic Folklore.

They could stand 4 blocks tall and 2 blocks wide, with an upright, proportionately slender humanoid frame that features long, thick limbs. They could sport long noses and big ears, and may have up to 3 heads. They can break any blocks as strong as wood or maybe stone blocks, but nothing over obsidian. They may be neutral, but territorial mobs that spawn alone or in a trio at most in their own homes in their respected biome, they also might be able to eat other mobs and/or players, and if exposed to sunlight for too long will have a 50% chance of either bursting into pebble particles or turning into a statue that if mined with a pickax enchanted with silk touch can be collected as a trophy or decoration of sorts.</p>",

(it has always wondered me why mojang added ladders to some village structures when villagers are incapable of using them correctly)</p>\n<p>And for villagers to use trapdoors would also be nice. This however might lead to some problems in regards to using trapdoors for their intended purpose, trapping/deveiving mobs and therefore also villagers. So this especially requires some carefull thoughts to not break more than it adds.</p>\n<p>Being able to craft regular doors/trapdoors/fence gates into variants that are inoperable by villagers is a feasible solution. Perhaps the opposite could also be an option. Make villagers unable to operate regular doors/trapdoors/fence gates and only be able to operate ones that has been marked as \"villager doors\" perhaps by crafting a door together with an emerald. This would ofcourse require naturally generated doors in villages to be of this new type.</p>\n<p>Anyways, I would love for villagers to be able to uttilize these in their normal pathfinding :)</p>",

On these festive days, I think the villagers should have cheaper and better trades the same way they do when you gain the Hero of the Village achievement after you defeat a raid. Their prices should be reduced and they should also have new trades that they wouldn't normally give you; for example, fireworks, pre-dyed armour, cakes and patterned banners in exchange for emeralds. I love the singing/dancing idea! Maybe the baby villagers could have their own ceremonial dance? As someone else in this comment section said, I don't think these festivals should be too common. Maybe they could only occur on days such as Christmas, Halloween, Eid, etc? I know you said you didn't want to bring religion/real-life festivals into Minecraft which I totally understand, but if these festivals happen too often they will become repetitive which is why I think they should only be allowed to occur on certain days of the year. Maybe Minecraft could have a feature where you register the date of your birthday into the game (you don't have to specify the year), and on that day, there are festivals in the villages? There should also be an achievement that the player gains after they enter a village with a festival going on.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I'll appreciate if you give this comment a vote if you agree with any of my points, thank you!</span></p>",

These low level books could easily hit the max armor stand combining limit as well in our attempt to maximize them.

Zombie curing should not be touched either unless the one cure is comparable to curing them the 4-5 times now.&nbsp;</p>",

Dealing with villagers is already stressfull, but with this change we will need to transport villagers thousands of blocks just to have access to some books. And now because there will be no more efficiency V books we will not be able to craft a maxout toll even after all this works to get the necessary trades. Because the level cap of the anvil will not let it happen. This change require a hole overhaul system on enchanting mechanics, villager transportation, enchant table. Instead of a small update. U guys need to plan it better. Otherwise it will ruin a lot of players gameplay experience </p>",

However I also believe they over killed the expert level librarian in which my suggestion would be that there is a 50% chance for the master level librarian to sell the max level to their enchantment book with the other 50% to be the level below max level as this will make it not as brutal of a nerf while ensuring that after a little work a player can get the enchantments that they desire without it being entirely guaranteed or overly randomized. With how librarian villagers are now its far to random and tedious to get the enchantments that you desire however with these new changes and the small change I suggested earlier getting great villager trades will now feel more rewarding and less of a grind to get what you are searching for. I still believe though that the enchantment table needs an overhaul though as its far to random to get any enchantment that your looking for.</p>",

There's a lot more thing that you guys can do like, fixing bug that almost 8 years old but never been fix for a reason for example and maybe fixing the worst performance of the game.Mojang should make change that attract people, not to force them playing for hours,this update really messed up so consider change it or make some minor nerf with the curing mechanic or something.Make change that attract people so their money to.(the change of the wandering trader is only thing good in this update)</p>",

If you must change things, roll it back to the way it was in 1.13.2. You could breed villagers, or cure Zombie Villagers and you had to take what you got, You could not change it by breaking a work station. What they grew up to be, was what they were. It is not super easy, build a trading hall, then breeding and choosing villagers to keep.</p>\n<p>Villager have already been balanced in a lot of ways, Villager in 1.13.2 and before traded all day and night, they occasionally locked up but would unlock by trading a different item. Now they trade only a few hours a day and frequently lock after 1-2 trades, sometimes till the next day. People call that overpowered ???</p>\n<p>Traveling thousands of meters out to trade for a watered down trade is not the way to go.(Highest Unbreaking is II not III) Most players won't bother. Who is going to transport those villagers with the nerfed trades back thousands of blocks to a trading hall that took weeks to complete, not me! And a lot of other players have told me the same.

We went from get all the enchanment from any villager at 1 emerald (zombified and de-zombified 5 times) to find a swamp (that coul be 5000 block away), build a villager breeding, upgrade to master, an only for 1 book.

Could be expensive, maybe like this: in the enchatment table with another book, and amount of lapis lazuli and that consumed all 30 levels of experience from you (can place the enchantment table right next to an experience farm).</p>",

Can you have crops in the underground, Guess not because there is lack of sunlight, in fact The village will need to be filled with light sources because of the darkness (Im not sure if they have darkness what don’t blame me I haven’t played beta!) If its going to be rare won’t the light sources on the village and the and the cave filled with darkness want you to walk to the light source of the village or maybe the cave has light which I highly doubt it. (*Sigh it is just that If there is light sources It won’t be like the original caves and those are what i’m used to what i played Minecraft in like what beta and a Minecraft veteran is used to these things) That’s the problem (If there is no light source in caves…)</p>",

It could have two comands; \"follow\" the player and attack mobs the player attacks and eliminating need of leash , and \"guard\" the spot it stands in a 9 chunk square with ability to patrol, also if the player hits golem it wont attack them.<br>Their fighting could also be improved, but not buffed anymore, like they could block projectiles and take little to no damage so they can fight ranged mobs, and their swings hitting multiple mobs at once. <br>Also to differentiate Golems, the texture could be improved by them having a band/ sash accross their chest and waist; Village Golems would have colors similar to the village they spawn in like tiaga or desert, and Player Golems would have a white one that could be dyed other colors. <br>This would give players the ability to make an army, each with a color, that is effective to move and command but not cheap to make and maintain, and would keep the villagers peacefull, also decreasing the need for more freindly mobs and pets for combat needs.</p>",
