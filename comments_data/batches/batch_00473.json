Simply have the Lapis in your inventory and the Magic Book will work. Adds a cool new use to something we get a lot of! And this weapon would cast damaging spells like you said.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Amethyst has only practical uses for such a magical-looking material. We could create a Magic Staff out of a few Gold Ingots and an Amethyst Shard, which could potentially cast helpful spells on allies, like healing, strength, speed, etc. This would use Lapis as ammo, as well.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, we could upgrade the Magic Book and Magic Staff with Echo Shards to cast more potent spells. The upgraded Magic Book could cast powerful elemental spells that freeze, ignite, or electrocute enemies, while the upgraded Magic Staff could apply effects that aren't obtainable usually, like blindness, nausea, mining fatigue, etc.</p>\n<p>This would finally give us some more variety in combat. With other games, I like to do magic-only playthroughs, but Minecraft just never had that option available. Hopefully something like this appears in 1.21 since they're thinking about sprucing up combat for those who enjoy it!</p>",
