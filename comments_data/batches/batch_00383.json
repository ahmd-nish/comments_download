I think Terraria has dragonite ore in the game already so maybe minecraft could take inspiration from them.</p>",

I think of the Nether Star like a pure energy source, so why does it need so many blocks of ores to actually be powered up? I think it could be explored further. And also the smithing table, how Iron is collected, more reasons to explore etc.</p>\n<p>I feel Iron Armor and a Shield is \"aight, you're fine now\" or even considered \"late game\" because its the 2nd strongest armor, and you get it from strip mining 32 iron ore, and boom you're \"safe\" now. May even be the best armor and tools considering how easy it is to alleviate challenge in this game, again strip mining = no mobs. And even in caves, mob spawning can have problems, as in sometimes caves will just not have mobs. Caves right now need a big rework, as the variety in them is certainly... not a lot. You could at least have more cave generation differences or variety if you cant pull of a huge cave update. Generation makes a big difference.</p>\n<p>Smithing Table being used for making iron / gold / diamond tools and armor would be cool too, since its realistic. oh and beds kinda alleviate challenge too i guess maybe. idk i had some super high iq thoughts here but couldnt type any more srry</p>",
