        "body": "<p>Developers of Mojang:</p>\n<p>I have been playing Minecraft since 2014 and I now work on Bukkit plugins. Currently, I'm working on a punishment plugin (github/A248). For developers, there are 2 main sources of UUID/name conversion information. First, minecraft servers maintain their own internal cache of players who've joined the server. Second, Mojang maintains its API which servers use to lookup the UUIDs of new players.</p>\n<p>Using the internal cache only, it is impossible to use the names of players who have not joined a server in a plugin which runs on that server. For example, \"/ban player1\" will not work if \"player1\" has never joined the server. This is not ideal. Consequently, plugin developers often incorporate the Mojang API into their plugins. Using the Mojang API lets plugins accept playername inputs of players who have not joined the server.</p>\n<p>However, the Mojang API's limits, while well-intentioned, make these kinds of operations hard. as such, my plugin will check the internal cache, check its own cache, check a third-party API, and then finally check the Mojang API. It is, for sure, not an ideal solution, but it's better than prohibiting banning players who have never joined before.</p>\n<p>CONTINUED</p>",

        "body": "<p>CONTINUED</p>\n<p>The official rate limit is so harsh that github/Electroid has created a third-party API which isn't rate limited in any way. His API is essentially a massive cache of Mojang API results + the ability to bundle queries into a single request. There have been other similar third-party API services. These sites function as another layer of caching and resolution.</p>\n<p>It strikes me as terribly inefficient that there are several levels of caching which developers require for a simple name/UUID conversion. In fact, I have heard of large servers utilising multiple IP addresses in order to bypass rate limiting; I do not agree with such actions, but I would prefer they were not necessary for those large servers which undertake them. Please consider reducing the official rate limits. The Mojang API is the only one which developers can rely on for consistently reliable resolution.</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>A248</p>",
