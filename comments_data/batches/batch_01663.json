I play Minecraft: Xbox One Edtion, but it isn't updated anymore and can't be bought anymore so I can't play it with friends who are new to the game unless they buy it used on disc. Minecraft: Xbox One Edition was as similar to the Java Edition as they could get it. When I play it I get a prompt regularly to switch to the bedrock edition and get reminded each time that it is not updated anymore. So because of allmost being forced to switch to the bedrock edition I want it to be like Minecraft: Xbox One Edition, so more or less like the Java Edition but optimized for a console. If on the Xbox there was a real choice like on pc where you can play both the Windows 10 and Java Edition which both get updates I wouldn't want it. It is awesome to have two flavours of your favorite game, but not if they stop serving one of them. Then you want what remains to be your favorite flavour, and for that it needs some of the weird ingredients that make it special.</p>",

Block spitting is stable behavior I can understand and predict, so long as I use a 1-tick pulse. QC is more \"WTH?\" I'd love to see a Redstone block design proposal where the block behaves in a predictable way, same as a the \"grabber\" piston above or the Observer Block.<br><br>If someone could cook up a \"QC\" block, make a YT video of how this block works, what it does and doesn't do, I would so totally support that. I obviously can't do it since I can't wrap my mind around a set of specific rules to explain it. But someone does, and someone *can*.

It's important that we make sure the community can agree on this topic, so why not just have both? I don't know a lot about how hard it would be to implement, but I think these features should be a world option (maybe even a game rule?) in which you can toggle back and forth before getting back on your world. There could be an option such as, \"Java Redstone\" and another that says, \"Bedrock Redstone\", with explanations of course, for example: \"Java Redstone is the older and more classic way in which you can...\" and \"Bedrock Redstone is the new and improved smoother redstone, in which you can...\" With this, I feel everyone would be able to make redstone contraptions the way in which they please.</p>",

IF quasi connectivity is to be added, there are three specific requirements that need to happen in my opinion:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Separate redstone hitboxes are displayed to the player when placing. Ideally normal pistons won't gain this feature.</li>\n<li>Pistons with quasi connectiviy should be a separate block from normal pistons, and should be visually distinct and have a separate crafting recipe, Like replacing cobblestone with quartz in the crafting table.</li>\n<li>The awful block update system isn't ported. If something isn't powered, it shouldn't be powered. If it is powered, I shouldn't need another block to make it work.</li>\n</ol>",

The unique Bedrock mechanic is really useful and can even account for some use cases where quasi-connectivity is used on Java, notably in vertical piston extenders.</p>\n<p>Fourthly, its implementation couldn't be the exact same as in Java due to the fact that Bedrock Edition doesn't use block updates to make its redstone work, likely due to block updates being too laggy for low end devices. Either the redstone circuit system would always check extra blocks below the blocks it normally checks for components, removing quasi-connectivity's function as a block update detector and making redstone contraptions even more bulky, or pistons would be the only redstone components that block updates make check their redone state, but block updates don't progress from block to block instantly in bedrock, and pistons in bedrock extend 1 redstone tick after being powered, making it's usage even more limited.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I’ve played Minecraft for many many years. I never got the chance to ever attend a Minecon apart from the Live in 2019 which is when the Founders Cape was released. This is the closest thing to a Minecon I could ever get to. It’s such a shame that it’s only in Bedrock and not Java. Especially with there being the Migrator, Vanilla, Followers, Cherry Blossom, Purple Heart, 15th Anniversary and the MCC 15th Anniversary capes all on bedrock and Java. It’s just seems unfair to not be allowed to have access to the Founders Cape on Java. I understand there was an exploit letting players obtain the Founders Cape even once it had been removed from the market. However, Mojang have (as far as I’m aware) removed the illegitimate capes from the accounts that never originally got it. All current and existing capes should be added to Java and Bedrock unless if it’s a Bedrock Skin Pack.</p>",

Putting mending on your tools is a little pointless in Bedrock because you have to be holding the tool for the experience to go toward repairs. Easy to do in Java, just pop the tool into your offhand and spend some time at your local xp farm, rather than the annoying \"swipe with sword, QUICK switch to your tool before the xp gets to you!!!!okay now back to the sword\" that Bedrock has to deal with.</p>\n<p>And I agree that the crouch-to-block mechanic is garbage and has gotten me killed on more than one occasion because of how unpolished it feels.

You can only use shields, totems, arrows, and maps. (And maybe a couple other little things). In Java Edition, you can literally put anything you want in the offhand, and activate it when your main hand is inapplicable. This is really helpful. You can keep fireworks there for easy flight access, food for easy food eating, and use pairs. Some pairs are ladder and block (to make a quick ladder tower), Pickaxe and Torch (For mining), Pickaxe and block (for building), and many other things. Sometime there are two main inventory items you need for a project, and with the Offhand, you can just use one slot, whereas in Bedrock edition, you have to switch BACK and FORTH and BACK and FORTH. The offhand tool is a very convenient quality of life change, yet it hasn't been fixed in MCPE since it came out 4 years ago! We also need a button like F to swap hands, or even keep this button in the unmapped control category. I really hope that this relatively easy code-fix is implemented into MCPE.</p>",

Hoppers should remember for a tick if they've sent something, so a newly received item can be put into the previous item's slot. Alternatively, incoming item(s) could be held in a buffer until the hopper sends out item(s), to ensure proper slot placement.</p>\n<p>Edit: Thinking a bit more about it, the buffer would also need to be implemented for all types of storage containers (chests, barrels, etc). Don't want a chest between 2 hoppers getting the order messed up.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Bedrock need this.</p>\n<p>Regarding the comment by TakingItCasual - one way to fix this could be;</p>\n<p>When an item enters a hopper, it enters an 'array' in C++. That array is built using 0-indexed keys and when the hopper wants to push an item, it systematically works its way down the array, remembering the last key it pushed, and then pushes the next highest key number, returning back to key 0 when there are no keys higher than the current one.</p>\n<p>For example:<br>Hopper #1 - pushes key 0, then on the next push, key 1, then key 2.</p>\n<p>As each hopper receives an item (Hopper #2), it is entered in to an 'array' for that hopper (#2), using the next available key. If hopper #2 already has an item in slot 5, then the item from Hopper #1, enters the Hopper #2 array as key 0. When hopper #2 pushes its item, it will push key 4 (slot 5) first, then key 0 (slot 1), because hopper #2 recorded that it last pushed an item from key 3 (slot 4). This way of using arrays within C++, tied to each hopper, ensures all hoppers within a chain move items in the same order they receive an item. This ensures items do not flow out of sequence when moving through hopper chains and will enable parity between the Java version and Bedrock version. If each hopper in a chain, is also triggered beginning with the last hopper, working backwards to the very first hopper, this will also ensure that several items moving through a hopper chain, continue to run in the order than they were first pushed from Hopper #1 to Hopper #2.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I don't think that zero tick should be inplemented into Bedrock for a few reasons. But before that I want to address a misconception that I see in the comments before I comment.</p>\n<p>1. A zero tick pulse is a redstone pulse that turns on and off in the<strong> same</strong>&nbsp;<a title=\"Tick\" href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tick\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tick</a>. An observer normally outputs a 2gt pulse.</p>\n<p>2. A zero tick pulse should be differentiated from a 1gt(1 game tick, 2gt=0.1s) pulse and a 2gt pulse. Although it can be used to<strong> instantly</strong> move a block, the most noticeable difference (in Java) is how they interact with entities. When powering a sticky piston with a block in front, if the pulse is actually 0gt, the block won't move the entity at all. With 1gt the block will move the entity by a bit, but not so much as 2gt.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you want to learn more about 0-tick, I highly recommend <a href=\"https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Zero-tick_pistons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the wiki article</a>&nbsp;and videos on Youtube such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBM7I6D59gI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this one</a>.</p>\n<p>Now for the actual reasons :</p>\n<p>1. Currently it is unclear whether the whole 0-tick thing is intended. There is a <a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-8328\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bug report</a> about it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. Farms utilizing 0-tick is unlikely to be<a href=\"https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-113809\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> intended.</a></p>\n<p>3. If instant pistons are added like java (e.g. retracting a redstone block instantly loses its power), it will break a lot of current timing-based contraptions. What's worse than that is the performance issue. Though instant wires are cool, faster pistons will introduce more lag.</p>\n<p>4. A lot of the 0-tick pulse generators is based on BUD, and most others are based on update orders. As BUD is unlikely to get introduced into bedrock, those based on update orders may not work at all in bedrock.</p>",

I call them \"tick-abuse farms\" because they force a crop to try to grow by emulating a random tick (you can see this on Java Edition by setting the randomTickSpeed to a large value). For some reason, the crop mistakes the moving sand ticking the crop for a random tick and tries to grow.<br><br>2. While zero-ticks are likely a bug (in this case, an artifact of single gametick differences in update speed between 2 redstone signals, like the difference between a 1-tick repeater and a comparator), 1-ticking is a feature which I believe should be a part of Bedrock. Last I played, the piston extension speed was not even consistent. 1-tickng on its own makes redstone feel snappy and responsive, on Bedrock it just feels slow.<br><br>3. Piston block spitting is in my opinion something which Bedrock deparately needs. It vastly simplifies most contraptions, allows for flying machines, and don't really cause any problems when not used.<br><br>4. While many here clearly dislike BUDs, I honestly feel that they make redstone a much better system. They are the only way to do many things, in fact. For instance, stacked pistons can extend in sync without extended circuitry. If one is causing issues, a simple slab or piece of glass will suffice to fix it.<br><br>TL;DR: Piston block spitting, BUDs, and 1-tick pistons should be in the game. 0-tick should probably not.</p>",
