Redstone pros might want to minimize lag and want entity despawn to be faster (or maybe they want it to be longer depending on what they are trying to make) and survival players definitely want entity despawn to take way longer in order to give us time to find our stuff again, instead of having to race to the chunk and set render distance to 2 on the way to the death location just to make sure we can get as much time as possible to relocate our stuff while we are actually in the chunk.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think that as well as frequently used options like you said like 1-10 or 30 minutes, the player should be able to enter a time length of how long they want items to be there (Maybe they want it to be an hour, or even 2? what if you died on an amplified world and half of your stuff fell on the top of the cliff and the rest at the bottom of a super long fall? that would require a lot of time to retrieve!). This is a variable that could definitely easily be adjusted and I think we should have the ability to change it in order to ensure the best out of gameplay.</p>",
