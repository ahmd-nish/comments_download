Wanna hate on that kinda progress. Ok. But just know, this idea can turn out to be something really incredible. So go take your icologer/moobloom losing whines all the way down down to the deep dark. Progress is changing, get with the program or don’t update. It makes sense to put archeology in for caves and cliffs, I mean it involves digging so yeah. Like I mean seriously. Some of the stuff they added already felt like a mod. Cause wanna know what mods are? A way for players to put their ideas into a suggestion and make it playable for everyone, it’s basically like this feedback place, but more fun for modders to do.</p>",

My son and I just spent two hours trying to knock the Wither down using iron golems, and we had to walk away from the game for a while to cool off because we were so frustrated. The lag made it very difficult to move and impossible to hit the Wither. I don't care how it's fixed, I'd like the issue solved, please. I would love to see anyone from Mojang try to defeat the Wither on an Xbox One once that lag kicks in. Maybe it's eventually do-able, but it's not fun, and I thought the idea of the game was to be fun. I don't care that the Wither is difficult to kill. I care about the lag it generates. Balance it, please, in the direction of allowing players to play with minimal, or preferably no lag.</p>",
