This screenshot is from 1.14.30 on Windows 10:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/gpXEOTq-5mkPJvMcgFBSRw.png\"></p>\n<p>As you can see, it's&nbsp;<em>much</em> more barren than what Java is producing.</p>\n<p>It's important to note that Bedrock used to have generation with more tall grass! Back during the MCPE days, grass generated like it does on Java. I have no idea why this was changed to what we have now.</p>\n<p>I really want to see tall grass improved on Bedrock. When I walk around the plains, it just looks so barren, plain and... wrong for the game.</p>\n<p>So, yes, I fully support improving this change and I hope a Mojangster can comment on this topic soon.</p>",
