So, even if you sold an elytra for 10 stacks of emeralds, seeing as just AFKing overnight a few times next to your auto farm will get you like 5 double chests full of pumpkins, and farmers sell an emerald for 6 pumpkins, you can get loads of emeralds in no-time. It's true that getting a villager to master level is hard, but I think if they sell that kind of items for just emeralds, then you could get tons of netherite and elytra with only the cost of a shulker box. That would also make netherite armor and tools and elytra a Renewable resource, which I think the developers might not want. (Currently, only the netherite hoe is renewable.)</p>",
