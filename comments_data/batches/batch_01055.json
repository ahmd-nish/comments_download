You could use this brush to choose from a variation of different blocks which don't' have individual block types. So for instance if some grass blocks could generate with a flower in the top corner, but when broken are simply grass blocks, you could record that block so when placing a grass block using the variation brush, you have that as one of your options.&nbsp;<br><br>This allows for a more varied overworld with many different blocks but doesn't take up inventory space as no new blocks are being added. This feature could be incorporated into the memory brush, but I kept them as separate entities for simplicity's sake.&nbsp;<br>I look forward to reading any comments or ideas on how to improve this :)&nbsp;<br>Thanks for reading my idea,&nbsp;<br>~Silver</p>",
