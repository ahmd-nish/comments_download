        "body": "<p>I think it's an interesting idea to activate TNT instantly with redstone, but if we did that, there wouldn't be any time to make sure that it would blow up any of said redstone. It would make lots of contraptions, such as TNT duplicators and even a normal TNT dispenser not work. When I build my redstone contraptions, I try to make it so that I can \"reset\" them, or make it so that they can activate again. It would screw with that philosophy if I couldn't do that, and it would make a lot of fun or cool contraptions, such as a tunnel bore or a world eater, completely unusable. Making instant TNT might be more convenient for some people, but for hardcore redstoners, it would be a nightmare to work around. Additionally, some of the challenge with TNT is the long exploding time, but is re-balanced by how powerful it is. For a combat player, it would be challenging to find a good time to use TNT, but that allows it to seem more creative or out-of-the-box if you come across a situation where you actually can use it. Overall, instant TNT would make a cool potential convenience feature, but unless it's a completely new variant of TNT that allows normal TNT to still work as it currently does, instant TNT would literally blow up in everyone's faces.</p>",
