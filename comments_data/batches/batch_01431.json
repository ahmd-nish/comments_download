None of these ideas are good, and most of them sound like they could've been written by a fetus in fetu (If you don't know what that is, please don't search it up). To say the least, every post starting from now, if I ever decide to write another, will be planned in many more than 5 minutes. If I don't keep that promise, I'll just shut up and leave.

It can be led by a lead but will only alter at hostiles if in a lite area, making it a useful mob to watch your back when solo mining.</p>\n<p>Automaters- these golems will tackle grinding tasks for players and have a maintenance or cool-down need to ensure players check up on them. Fishing, Farming, Lumber harvesting (log block breaker), Cobblestone block breaker, and Item sorting; are all tasks players would love to automate, and that could be balanced by golems that do cool-downs or need maintenance periodically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attacking/Defense- this is mostly filled already but; an improved ranged or smart turret that could be limited by actual ammo consumption (buffed by being able to toss potions) and a shield/wall golem that is 2 tall and will move in front of ranged hostiles to block their shots are two niches that need a golem.
