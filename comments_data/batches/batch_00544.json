Yes, they were originally created when Notch messed up the model while working on pigs, but lore-wise, creepers are probably related to plants rather than pigs. According to Notch: \"I imagine them as being made out of leaves or similar.\" and \"I've imagined them as being crunchy, like dry leaves.\" In fact, the creeper texture (one of the oldest, if not THE oldest, unchanged texture in the game) is literally just a tiled and cropped Alpha leaves texture on a white background with a face and toenails.</p>\n<p>As for the enchantment itself, I think it's a fine idea, and I wouldn't be opposed to it. It would certainly be useful in the Nether. But since this enchantment would likely let you kill piglins and zombified piglins in a single hit more easily, I wonder if it would actually be too powerful.</p>\n<p>The whole point of the piglin mob anger behavior is to make you think twice about attacking one. You have to work to get really strong weapons/potions before you can consistently kill them in a single hit (thus preventing the others from getting angry). Adding an enchantment like this might lower that barrier and make it too easy to \"cheese\" the Nether.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I think this idea could work, but it would have to be carefully balanced to avoid taking away from the challenge that the Nether is supposed to be.</p>",

Instead, it would be found at y=30 and below. Other than that, its generation would be the same.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two reasons for this change. The first is that copper needs a place on the tech tree. I know that the tech tree is sacred, but there is also another reason that would really help the game out even if copper doesn't do what I am requesting. Iron is very powerful, and, right now, it's too easy to get. The player can get some pretty powerful enchanted iron gear pretty early on since iron gets better enchantments than everything except gold and netherite. Making it so that you need to dig deeper to more dangerous parts of caves in order to get it would really help the progression out.</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I feel as though I haven't talked enough about copper tools. All of the tools will deal the same amount of damage as their iron counterparts. The only difference being mining. Copper tools break blocks slightly slower than iron. The copper pickaxe should be able to mine up to gold, but not diamond, obsidian and netherite. Let's look again at the tech tree. If you can skip copper and go straight to iron because all you need is the stone tier, then why make copper tools other than because how cheap they are? I am sorry about this, but we are going to have to look back at the tech tree. In order to get iron, you need a copper pickaxe.

Also, it could be combined with gold to make it rust slower but less durable. Copper armour would be significantly less durable but as protective or almost as protective as iron. It would require a significant amount of maintenance, and may not be worth it late-game. When the rust is scraped off (which is required for repairing) it would lose 1/8th of its initial durability, meaning maintenance is ESSENTIAL and it will require much larger quantities of copper in the long-run. Also, as you repair rust-resistant equipment, it would lose its rust resistance.</p>",
