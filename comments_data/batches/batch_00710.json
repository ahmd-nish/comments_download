This would mean you have to wait longer (but still faster than smelting an individual raw ore) and you'd get less XP in return for a full raw ore block. Fuel consumption is done per item as I recall so balancing it is going to have to based on the XP reward and how many ticks it takes to smelt the item. So while you would get more iron/gold/copper faster/ingot, it's less of an XP reward so players and prioritized based on which is more important fast iron, or getting some XP easily.&nbsp;</p>",

Sure, they want to keep a mystery element to all of it, which is exactly why they didn't directly state that the monster in Disc 11 is the Warden. Kingbdogz directly said in an Ask Mojang video that it is not necessarily based on that monster. He never rejected nor confirmed that proposition. Mojang almost never directly reveals any of the lore elements of the game to us. 90% of the time, it's all up to our interpretation. I'd even go as far as to say that they don't keep a specific lore timeline or sequence when designing features, but rather add lore elements along the way as they're updating the game to keep players theorizing and wondering more. A lot of the time we see people like Jeb saying that they don't know if a certain lore theory is true, and I'd argue that all of this is genuine. None of them know! They just create the little threads that players could connect together in any way and from any perspective they want, without even connecting those threads themselves in the first place. They don't know the story cuz there is no fixed story! They never made one! The players are the ones who make the stories. There is no fixed lore sequence to reveal; it's all up to you.</span></p>",
