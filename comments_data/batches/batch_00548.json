There can be a whip for every basic ore: leather, stone, gold, iron, diamond, and netherite, but also any new ones if there's any. They could also have a spike at the end (enchantment?). Anyways, I didn't want this idea to be too bland and all, just something I would have said or added.</p>",

I think making an entirely new bow would be a bit much since there's not a lot separating a bow/crossbow from a theoretical reinforced bow/crossbow, so I'd suggest making it more of an upgrade rather than an alternative. For example, combining a bow with 2 goat horns, 1 stick, and 3 string (or 2 goat horns, 1 stick, 2 string, and maybe even 1 iron for a crossbow) would create a reinforced bow - this could apply to ores as well. That way bows/crossbows and their reinforced counterparts wouldn't be competing with each other; instead, the latter would be the next step up from the former. Horns from goats and cattle have traditionally been used (notably by the nomadic peoples of Central and Northeast Asia) to increase flexibility and power in real-life bows anyway, and it seems like it could fit naturally in the world of Minecraft, keeping with the more \"medieval\" setting as they say. Also, having to upgrade a normal bow/crossbow really does fit the concept of a \"reinforced bow/crossbow.\"</p>\n<p>[ empty, goat horn, string;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; stick,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;bow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; string;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; empty, goat horn, string ]</p>\n<p>[ goat horn, empty/iron ingot, goat horn;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; string,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; crossbow,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;string;</p>\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; empty,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;stick,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; empty ]</p>\n<p>Some possible crafting recipes: honestly, the sticks might be overkill.

The item would be similar to how Written Book/Book and Quill work, with the restriction of it being only one page long. It would come with a re-textured GUI to look like a piece of paper or a note.</p>\n<p>What I also had in mind it being able to be pinned to the side of a wall, either with, or without an Item Frame (the latter would make sense with how Maps can be displayed), to make for a noticeboard. The \"Written Paper\" would have a bigger look than a regular Paper displayed in Item Frame, just like Maps do, either readable like Signs or opening up a GUI to read what is written on it.</p>\n<p>Writing on the \"Letter\" would open up the GUI, with signature options and all, after then it becomes locked from further editing and becomes a \"Written Paper\". Reading the \"Written Paper\" would happen by either holding it in hand, or better: opening up a readable GUI by clicking on it when it's displayed/pinned on the Item Frame or wall; (however, Maps displayed in Item Frame are rotated by clicking on them which wouldn't make sense in this case...) This would mean you don't need to take it off and put it back on every time you want to read it. The item would be popped out from it's place by punching on it, just like any displayed item.</p>\n<p>Crafting recipe for it could be logically Paper, Ink Sac and Feather.</p>\n<p>This would be a nice addition using ingredients and mechanics already in game, and would be great for adventuring and roleplay purposes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Currently, if you're above the water line with a Night Potion, you can see into the water, which really doesn't make sense, seeing as how it's a&nbsp;<em>Night</em>&nbsp;Potion.&nbsp;That aspect of the Night Potion could be taken away, and this could be added, letting you see into water when above and under water. This could make fighting, building, and mining underwater much better, making it easier to do all of those and could encourage new mobs, ores, exploration, and structures underwater. The only thing I would change, is instead of making the sight infinite (which would crash whatever console you're on), just making it go only as far as sight on land.</p>",
