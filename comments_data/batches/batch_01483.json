Maybe there could be Vermillion Fungus that grows on the trees. Another mob that should spawn here are netherite blazes.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Netherite Blazes</strong></em></p>\n<p>Netherite Blazes could have netherite armour with a boss bar split into segments that shows the durability of the armour. These blazes could be like overpowered skeletons. With shields that have spikes of netherite they can block all ranged attacks and destroy the weapon used, encouraging players to get up close to do melee attacks but it will be hard to do so, as the bows, reinforced with netherite can shoot flaming arrows that not only cause severe fire damage but also lower the durability of shields extensively, encouraging players to doge the bullets, which will... also be hard to do as these arrows are like the shulker bullets, they don't stop travelling until they hit their target or hit a block. The Best way to attack this guy is with an inventory with a level five sharpness netherite sword and a bunch of fire resistance potions.</p>\n<p>Now for rewards. The Player would've had a hard time battling the Blaze so they should get the shield, bow and also flaming arrows. The shield will also destroy the flaming arrows so once you've defeated one blaze, the next will be easier, a lot easier. The bow will be a normal bow with extra netherite texturing and a flaming arrow will set the block or player that it lands on, alight.</p>",

It can be applied to any item. This enchantment lowers the priority of the item so it's not immune to being stolen. There can also be different tiers. (The names are just an example) Keeping I, Keeping II, Keeping III and Keeping IV. Each one lowering priority more than others. There is also a potential for a curse. For example, Curse of Shinyness. This curse will make the priority of the item go up. It can also be used to your advantage by putting it on junk items so they get stolen instead of the precious items. Also, I wanted to point out that it would be a good idea that bats couldn't take items that have curse of binding.</p>",
