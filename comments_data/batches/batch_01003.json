De-crafting our Leather armor &amp; Horse armor into regular Leather similar to how you can already recycle Iron/Gold armor and tools from mob loot is a great way to acquire excess Iron and Gold for other projects. Players could smelt rails to iron nuggets to turn items the player don't want or don't use into ones they do like turning rail iron nuggets into redstone components. Not every player wants the same thing.</p>\n<p>I hope this would apply to not only Leather armor but Diamond armor too so we may recycle out end city and ancient city loot. The issue is that once you acquire a ton of good sets of armor, you have no need for extra sets. Being able to turn diamond armor/tools into diamond shards and craft those up into diamonds would enable diamond blocks and all diamond made items to be renewable (especially with villagers) this way we can build with diamond blocks easier once we're end-game.</p>",

I would however lean towards adding Quick Chage to the bow because, while the crossbows deal more damage than bows, the downside should still be that a bow can be loaded quicker than a crossbow.

If close enough you can kill multiple mobs too.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Having infinity would be OP such that you can basically have a down-graded version of this with piercing and multishot. With multishot, you can aim such that only the side arrows hit mobs and whereas the middle does not. With piercing (as ling as it's not a gigantic group) you can retrieve the arrow 9 times outta 10. Having infinity would just be too much. Quite frankly arrows aren't hard to come by and with mob farms, the crafting recipe, and simply that it's mutually exclusive with mending, infinity just becomes obsolete.</p>\n<p>Power, yeah crossbows should have it, but maybe not up to 5. As stated by someone else previously, the crossbow is primarily for crowd control and having it one-shot multiple mobs with multishot and piercing may be a bit much. Maybe add a new enchantment that goes up to 2 that's like power but doesn't insta-kill multiple mobs. Or make it where power can only go up to 2 on crossbows.</p>\n<p>Punch would be great because if you're dealing with crowds you can at least lighten the group of mobs or simply knock back multiple players at once.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Flame should be exclusive to bows, having it on crossbows would be just plain unbalanced!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>While I do agree that some changes are in order, I think the crossbow has plenty going for it as it is and I wouldn't be too disgruntled if no changes came. ut it would be nice for some no flavor to them as well!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>What do you guys think?</p>",

Some people say “no, it’d be too unbalanced or too OP” and to that i say. . . good. . . it SHOULD be more powerful than a bow. Think about it, why is the weapon with the cheaper recipe just outright better than the more expensive recipe??? Like imagine if the stone sword was stronger than the iron sword. How the hell would <em>that</em> make sense?</p>\n<p>A bow is made out of 3 string, 3 sticks. Essentially just a fishing pole with an extra string. Most common items for an end-game item recipe. You can easily get theses before your first bed in a new world. Now lets look at the cross bow: 4 sticks, 2 string, 1 plank and 2 iron ingots OR 3 sticks, 2 string 1 iron ingot and 1 spare trip wire if you happen to have one laying around (and lets be honest, you never do so you gotta make one).</p>\n<p>How are we spending more to make less??? That just sounds like unbalanced economics to me. If you ask me, I’m willing to take it to the extremes and say that bow needs to be nerfed with the crossbow getting what the normal bow lost. The bow should outright be the lesser weapon if we base things off of recipe economics, which we should since thats what defines an items equivalent to cost. Legit, why is this STARTER weapon also the end game weapon. The ramp is backwards here. As i said before, imagine if a wooden pick could mine everything the iron pick could but the iron pick could only mine cobblestone and coal.</p>",

Even if it's just an easter egg or random loot we have to find in The Deep or abandoned underground mines.\n<br />Or maybe, using telescopes in the recipe, could have different tiers of accuracy depending on what gemstone is used in the making of the telescope, e.g. \n<br />Amethyst telescopes could be more basic and slightly foggy but somewhat stable, Emerald telescope could be good for scouting villagers even at night, maybe Sapphire telescopes could help you see farther but slightly less accurate, Ruby telescopes could let you see hostile mobs by highlighting them in the lense and be accurate but not really useful for long distance, and Diamond telescopes could be the top of the list in both accuracy and distance but no special features.</p>",

Instead of how he described it, it would be more like the fallout addon/texture pack/maps, but instead of chests and whatnot, the world is the same as normal, but harder... sorta like if you made the overworld with the nether’s flaws like no water/placing water, and maybe the zombies would do double the damage as the Hard mode zombies</p>\n\n<p>Tho, I do agree it is not a mode I see for Minecraft... maybe a pre-world option to apply to a world you’re creating and you can remove it later but any of the would that you already rendered at least once will be unaffected by returning to normal... I could see a lot of useful uses in this, like it could be a whole new set of biomes, like the wasteland could be the plains, flower field and forests biomes’s replacement...</p>\n\n<p>Heck now that I’m saying this, maybe instead of his idea, just give us biomes based on an apocalyptic version of the biomes we already have with new versions of the mobs we already deal with!</p>",

Well, okay let me get into my thought process with you.</p>\n<p>We gotta talk about What Nuclear Materials DO: They make heat. Lots of it. You may as well call it magic. If you described a magical material that makes a TON OF HEAT ALL THE TIME and also destroys molecular bonds of stuff close to it, a scientist would say \"Oh, so it's radioactive!\" First and foremost, above and beyond every other aspect of what radiation is and what it does, this is the most readily apparent, useful, and actionable immediate effect.</p>\n<p>What does heat DO for us, in Minecraft?</p>\n<p>* Cooks food, <br>* Smelts ores, <br>* Bakes clay, <br>* Melts iron/gold stuff into nuggets, <br>* Vitrifies sand to Glass</p>\n<p>In Real Life, heat is used to cook, smelt, glaze, melt, and bake as well, THEN make electricity. Power plants (Coal, Oil, and Gas etc) are all just big'ol Steam Engines that boil water, making high pressure steam ready to spray out very hard through turbines, thus spinning them, moving magnets through coils of wire, which is what generates electric current.</p>\n<p>Before we can apply the heat of nuclear power toward making electricity, there must first be an infrastructure for using HEAT ITSELF that way. And as it stands, Minecraft doesn't seem to have a need for a mechanic like electricity; It would render EVERYTHING in the game presently redundant. Mods do it better.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I like this idea, but I think you should get more nuggets. I agree the durability should decrease the amount you get. A breastplate (gold or iron) takes 8 ingots and 1 ingot is the same as 9 nuggets, so each breastplate costs 8*9 = 72 nuggets to craft. In the same vein other pieces of armour, weapons and tools cost the following amounts: boots 36, helmet 45, leggings 63, sword 18, shears 18, hoe 18, axe 27, pickaxe 27, shield 9 and shovel 9.</p>\n<p>I think you should get half the material you used to craft it, minus the percentage of durability lost, in nugget form. So smelting a breastplate with full durability gets you 72/2 - (72/2 * 0%) = 36 nuggets, or 4 ingots. Smelting a breastplate at half durability gives you 72/2 - (72/2 * 50%) = 18 nuggets, or 2 ingots. Smelting a sword at 10% durability gives you 18/2 - (18/2 * 90%) = 9 - 8.1 = 0.9 nuggets, rounded down to 0.</p>\n<p>This would prevent gold farms in the nether from giving you too much gold through dropped gold swords, but would let you get back material if you didn't use it.</p>",

Since the introduction of elytra in 1.9 (long before the sprint sneak bug MC-152728 was introduced in 1.14.2) it has always retained your sprint if you were sprinting before entering a flying state.<br>It is my belief that elytra were misclassified as affected by the MC-15272 bug when they should not have been.<br>The logic used in the bug report is that the you cannot start a sprint during elytra flight, therefore you should not be able to retain sprint. However, this logic does not take into account the ramifications for player movement this change causes. Unlike the other player states (such as eating) there was also no advantage to sprinting during the elytra flight itself, as flight speed was never impacted by sprinting. This change has nerfed the usefulness of the elytra compared to it's launch state.</p>",
