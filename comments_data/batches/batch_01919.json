Maybe even a culinary work station which will allow us to make new food recipes.</p>\n<p>New biomes like an oasis biome found within deserts that have palm trees with coconuts or maybe allow us to get bananas from jungle trees.</p>\n<p>An extension to this idea is that maybe we should actually see the fruits on the actual leaves than have it drop with rng. Or maybe we could have both.</p>\n<p>Another idea is different berry types than just the sweet berry like blueberries and strawberries. Currently sweet berries are a bit generic and could encourage that all berries are safe to eat. When that is not true as there are poisonous berry types like night shade and holly berries.</p>\n<p>Finally give frogs a chance to drop frog legs, currently the rabbit leg is used to make the jumping potion, however I feel like it should be used to make the unobtainable in survival Luck Effect. And that frog legs give us the jump boost effect instead.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, please give us a food system update/overhaul.</p>",

Trims are crafted using ingots &amp; crystals, and echo shards would definitely fit into this category given their crystalline appearance. This trim would most likely stand out, considering echo shards aren't a solid color like the other trim materials. I envision it as having the signature sculk pattern with a bluish glow. This could also help motivate players to explore the Ancient City further, and the uniqueness of the trim would be justified by the difficulty of the challenge of avoiding the Warden. Not to mention every armor trim template has a corresponding material except for the Ward armor trim template. There are 11 different trim templates, yet only 10 different materials you can use. Adding echo shards as a trim material would add a complement to the Ward armor template and bring both the material and template count to 11.</p>",
