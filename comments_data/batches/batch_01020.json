Even though my device fully supports 120 FPS in other apps, Minecraft feels limited and less smooth compared to what the hardware can deliver.</p>\n\n<p>I kindly ask you to add official support for 120 FPS (ProMotion) in Minecraft Bedrock on iOS.

I really hope this feature can be added soon.</p>",

So why worry that “gyroscope affects balance”? The balance is already broken. Gyroscope is the ONLY way mobile players can compete fairly without extra hardware. • Safe Voice Chat Already Exists Everywhere Else Fortnite, Roblox, PUBG Mobile, and dozens more have: - Age restrictions (13+ / 16+) - Parent approval options - Mute + reporting tools If smaller companies can do this, Minecraft definitely can. • Bedrock Mobile Is Falling Behind No gyroscope. No advanced touch controls. No built-in voice chat. Yet Minecraft is the biggest game in the world. It’s time for Mojang to modernize Bedrock and fix these essential features. Please prioritize: ✔ Gyroscope for mobile ✔ Safe, age-restricted voice chat The Bedrock community deserves better.</p>",

If the enchanting table is underpowered, then fix the Enchanting Table.&nbsp; We don't want to use the Enchanting Table because we want specific enchantments on our equipment, not random ones. (I always want all equipment to have Unbreaking 3 and Mending. I always want my tools to have Efficiency 5. I always want one pick with silk touch and one with fortune 3, etc.<br><br>Perhaps, introduce some sort of recipe/formula mechanic for enchanting tables and provide the recipes and/or ingredients in different villagers and other places. Making equipment exclusive to one location forces a specific playstyle. For example, the mending enchantment is exclusive to Villagers and fishing, so your forced to either fish, or sit and reroll villagers over and over. No wonder everyone rerolls Villagers over and over, the outcome is more predictable and once you get a villager with mending, you don't have to do it again for another villager. If you get a mending book from fishing, you're still at the mercy of randomness for another mending book.&nbsp;</p>",
