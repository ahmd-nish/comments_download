Then why my Xbox one s runs Minecraft 10 year old game the same as switch I mean I am a Java player but now I am far from home and my Xbox series x which I don’t now how far render distance goes there I assume 32 chunks but idk.and as I wanted to play the game on Xbox I can’t it’s nearly unplayable also I run the server which render is locked for every player to 10 and I play on shaders which is kinda self explanatory why only 10 \n<br />But on fricking Xbox one………..ach man I’m so angry about this what next maybe set graphics to low and lock chunks only to 10 </p>",

Same goes for slim arms... except it wouldn't be quite as weird).</p>\n<p>Here's my reasoning: It would take a lot more effort to do this, and it would only be a single pixel difference (which on armor, is kinda redundant. They'd need to make Slim-Armed variants for every texture). And if someone with a Steve model wore the armor, then gave it to someone with an Alex model, then the armor would magically change sizes? (I know baby zombies change armor sizes, but it's a lot easier to give another player armor rather than a zombie).</p>\n<p>I suppose one way they could do it would be to simply resize the armor a smidgen, but then the texture would be slightly distorted (although having slim variants of the textures could be potentially interesting when combined with resource packs)</p>\n<p>But then what about armor stands? Would they use the slim models or the regular? :/</p>",
