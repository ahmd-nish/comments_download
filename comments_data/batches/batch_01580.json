Each combination should have their own damage values with its own cons like bulky zombies would do extra damage but would be slower, having no legs or no arms would cause the zombies to do move slower and damage you in a slower rate also. Adding these variants of zombies would make the early survival mode more fun and more challenging. </p>",

What I am thinking is HALF of the Hp points of the Wither. Because as we know plants are sort of delicate. AND make this plant invulnerable to every thing except fire because fire beats plant. The only way to do it is to get the fire scepter. In a fire cave I’ll talk about that later but have your idea about the fire cave. Then after that You get LOTS OF XP because without that it would be super useless..and we need some loot! When you kill the plant you get a key.That opens a chest in the cave, in the LOCKED chest in with you open with the plant key. You get the Plant Sword, the Plant Sword is stronger than a golden sword but weaker than a Netherite Sword. And the power when you sneak and look up trees (or drip leaves) pop out and you can walk, to get back down you shift and look down.</p>",

The stolon would look like a bamboo or a chorus plant (depending on randomly selected form), but dark brown-red and with multiple thorns. If it grows into you, you you loose 8 hearts (without armor), and it behaves as berry bush when \"rubbed against\". There would be a 3% chance of stolon turning into carnivorous leaf and 0.1% chance of it turning into an indigo, lupin-like flower.</li>\n<li>the mature stolon zone (100 to 400 blocks from the bulb) - there would be sparsely located flat carpet like leaves with bright green tentacles upon stepping on them, player would be forced into \"swimming position\" and would be almost completely immobilized, and then digested slowly.</li>\n</ul>",

If you want that there should be a new difficulty added to the game maybe call it \"insane\" or \"extreme\".</p>",

With all mobs, even boss mobs, there is a certain strategy or method by which you could prevent it from attacking you or by which you could get a huge advantage over that certain mob. This is not true for the Warden, and it should never be. You cannot cheese it, you cannot trick, and if you want to attack it or engage in combat with it you need to be within its range, so your only chance is to run away from it. They don't want the player to ever be able to uniformally take out the Warden, no matter how skillful or powerful. You need to be stealthy and dedicate all your strategies to avoiding it rather than killing it, and that makes it really unique and thrilling.&nbsp;</p>",
