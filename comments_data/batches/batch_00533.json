I'd make them only spawn in veins of 1 and only under y -48 so it could be like mining for diamonds pre cave update. The veins would need to spawn as sparsely as ancient debris. There are so many cool things that could be done with flawless diamonds, like an upgraded enchantment table or jukebox. And everyone wants to see diamond gear be the rarest and best again. This is just my personal opinion on how it should be added. I would also make the ore silk touchable, and the actual drop of flawless diamond be put in a crafting table, and be like turning gold into gold nuggets. I wouldn't call them diamond nuggets but the initial flawless diamond would need to be much larger. You'd get 9, and be able to recraft them into the larger flawless diamond, or the armor/tools. Again this is just how I think it should be added, and I think flawless diamonds need to be in the game to put diamond gear back on top. Also I think the upgraded enchantment table is a really good idea, but I haven't thought much on it.</p>",
