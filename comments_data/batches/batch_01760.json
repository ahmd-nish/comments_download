I would be able to make it so players can hold \"Gems\" or other custom items and have a potion effect given to them like faster healing or jump boost. This is currently possible with commands but its take too much storage to run more than one type of \"gem\" at once. Attribute modifiers would make it so that admin could create and item that would give effects quickly and in a compact way without having to add a huge group of commands running constantly. Currently the only attributes that even resemble potions are <em>minecraft:generic.max_health</em>, <em>minecraft:generic.attack_damage</em>, <em>minecraft:generic.luck</em>, and <em>minecraft:generic.movement_speed</em>. On another note there is only one attribute to my knowledge,&nbsp;<em>minecraft:generic.attack_knockback</em>, that resembles an enchantment. I plead with Mojang and/or Microsoft to please add this as an update to the game. There are many people in the command and map making communities would like to see this as an update.</p>",

It was called&nbsp;/compose instead of /inputraw,&nbsp;but otherwise did exactly what you now suggest. We drafted up documentation for it, came up with all sorts of cool ideas for what it was capable of, and one guy even wrote a simple mod to add it into the game. And it worked! We were starstruck.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">During the frenzy, Dinnerbone took a look and told us his thoughts and grounded us a bit more in reality, showing us the flaws we were perhaps willfully ignorant to. The first problem was names that contain quotes. Ideally, you'd be able to use this to make something like a sword that gets its name from an arbitrary entity. But by the very nature of the idea itself, this could result in a parsing error if a name with quotes breaks syntax.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">display:{Name:\"This is a \"slight\" problem\"}</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Dynamically escaping stuff is not only extremely difficult (if not impossible, as the evaluator has no idea of depth since the two components are right next to each other), it's also disingenuous because the resulting command would have a different output than it would if you used&nbsp;/tellraw&nbsp;before your JSON instead of&nbsp;/compose&nbsp;(or&nbsp;/inputraw).</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The nail in the coffin was the realization that, not only was it possible to construct inputs that would result in a syntax error in the final command, it was possible to construct inputs that would build wrongly! As Dinnerbone put it, \"Not escaping would lead to XSS attacks in minecraft maps, a terrible notion. 'Hey did you know that by naming a pig&nbsp;\",\"clickEvent\":\"/op foo&nbsp;you can become op?'\"</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I'm scrolling through the archives looking for more details. \"Sure thing. I'm not saying we'll not consider the idea, I'm just presenting more things to think about,\" was the last relevant thing I can see he said. It's a great idea but with some huge pitfalls.</p>\n<div class=\"accessory\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"accessory\"><em>&nbsp;(bad formatting removed, sorry ~nb)</em></div>",

For example, say you had a scoreboard objective called xPos and you wanted to teleport the player directly to the x-coordinate stored in there but keep every other coordinate the same. You'd do /execute as @p at @s using score @p xPos run tp @s &lt;xPos&gt; ~ ~</p>\n<p>Or lets say you have a scoreboard objective called Slot that tracks the index of the currently selected slot of a player and you want to use it to check the item in the same slot of another player. You'd do something like /execute using score Player1 Slot run data get entity Player2 Inventory[&lt;Slot&gt;]</p>\n<p>I realise even this can result in some problems, but it can achieve similar goals to your idea without some of the problems mentioned in the other comments.&nbsp;</p>",

(i.e. #minecraft:sheep_spawn_on, #minecraft:creepers_spawn_on). Some mobs already use block tags to determine what blocks they can spawn on, so making all mobs use it would make things easier.</p>\n<p>2) Biome tags to determine where mobs can spawn. This would primarily exist so modded mobs can be added to vanilla and other modded biomes more easily and in a data-driven way.</p>\n<p>3) Block/Light level conditions for each mob. I know that the \"dimension_type\" files already have this for monster spawning, but passive mobs are still hardcoded at 9 or above.</p>\n<p>4) The difficulty level the server must be on for mobs to spawn. This would default to Peaceful for passive mobs, and Easy for hostile mobs. This also means players could use datapacks to make mobs spawn on Peaceful difficulty, but not force all players to use it.</p>\n<p>5) For mobs that can wear armor / wield tools, the likelihood of those mobs having tools / wearing armor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Of course, the configurability we currently have (pack spawning min/max counts, spawn weights and spawn costs) should be preserved, this is just in my opinion what should be added on top of that.</p>",
