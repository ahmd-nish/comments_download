I love wolves and they are my favourite animal too, but I would think it's obvious that you can't go tame a wolf and for it to make a good pet like it does in Minecraft. Now they could do the same thing like they did with ocelots with wolves. Make wolves a separate mob that you can tame but will not follow you around and act like a dog, and make dogs a separate mob, which would be fine, but I don't see it making much of a difference in the grand scheme of things. I'm sure it would be much more effective to spread info on social media and talk to people about wolf misinformation/ the differences between dogs and wolves to help them or volunteer at a wolf sanctuary.</p>",

For clarity, I will refer to the intentional utilising either of these speed increases for some purpose in game as \"45ing\", \"45s\" etc, as the common way they are used would be to look 45 degrees from where you want to go, then hold (w/s) + strafe the opposite way.</p>\n<p>Although the 2.04% 45 boost while not crouching was not reported, the change that was made in 25w02a also eliminated this as a byproduct. The effects of removing sneak45ing on bridging have been spoken on plenty, and I have seen a proposed fix to this be increasing default sneak speed, however this is not a viable solution as it would leave regular 45ing relegated to the past, and so reverting the change is all around a more sensible solution.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;45ing has been present in the game since at least the days of beta (probably earlier but I can't attest to that) and has been a staple of the game for thousands of players for over a decade. It is commonly utilised for example when players are running with speed 2, and provides a small assist to escape/chase down people. --{1/2}--</p>",

Players will be forced to stay in an older version, or lose an incredible amount of depth that was previously present in the game.</p>\n<p>Overall, I can acknowledge how MC-271065 seems like buggy behaviour, because in a way it is. However, it has been a staple of the game for 15 years, and is hugely important to tens of thousands of players. It has absolutely no negative impact on the playing experience of the average player, but add massive amounts of depth and complexity to the game for players who want to push the possibilities of what can be done within the game to its absolute limits. Making a change like this for the sake of \"consistency\" does not improve the average player's experience in any way, but it effectively uproots entire communities that have sunk countless hours into this game we all love. I beg that this change be reverted, and perhaps all \"small\" changes to base movement mechanics not be altered with such reckless abandon in future.</p>",

Damage tilt and enchantment glint are also good examples of changes for the worst. Everyone I know has to bend over backwards to find alternatives to these changes, when Mojang could be putting their recourses, time, and effort into actually adding new content instead of trying to fix things that aren't broken. If you change a core aspect that's been in the game for years that hasn't had any complaints or problems, then of course it'll cause outrage. They labeled it as patching a \"bug\", yet it's existed in the game for years and they allowed everyone to become accustomed to it. If it truly was a problematic bug, it'd be a pretty significant one at that, considering how much it affects gameplay, and should've been taken care of when it first came out. However, now it's a core mechanic of the game and disabling movement momentum like this gets rid of a lot of pvp counter play and parkour techniques. Changing it doesn't help anything, it only makes game play worse. One thing they could actually fix and change is a bug that actually is problematic like sprint glitching, essentially when a player's sprinting slows down because of a certain action.&nbsp;</p>",

I still feel that it should be kept how it is, due to the amount of strategy built around this being the way the game works, most notably bridging. The fall damage change, however, is different. There's no theoretically correct number fall damage should start at (that wasn't chosen by the game designers). This is a significant change that causes vastly more accumulation of fall damage, and therefore annoyance, over time. Due to how short these distances in blocks are, a change from 3 blocks + 1 jump to 2 blocks + 1 jump is about a 25% alteration, which is hugely significant. I've tried it out in a normal survival context and it felt worse to play. Every time I took damage after jumping off a 2 block ledge, I noticed. I'm sure over time I'd stop noticing and it'd become more of a background irritation, but still, I can't remember any change made any time recently that I've thought actually made the game noticeably worse. I always feel irritated when people get annoyed at the latest features simply because they dislike them or view them through a negative lens, but I agree that this causes too much harm to be worth the benefits.</p>",

They aren't harming new players, but have actually positively impacted the older players who learned to utilize them. So many things that the community created were utilised by strafing and speed crouching, especially pvp and speed bridging. Which can hurt and change the multiplayer pvp and speed running community. And if its to be more realistic, that isnt really what everyone is focused on. Sure, at times it is nice, but this is also a videogame and should be enjoyed. Not to mention the other changes I had heard of about changing the distance of fall damage from 3 blocks to 2 blocks. You know how annoying that would be, especially for early gameplay? Or how about the potential changes to not allowing the swimming animation on land, aka, crawling? All the secret bases some of us have made and mining strategies that we use would be gone with it- This is like a repeat of the water bucket clutch situation.<br><br>There are somethings I can understand and view as bugs, but then again, isn't the more important thing that they are fun?</p>",

I think it's super cool that players can take these minor details of the game and ever-so-slightly improve their gameplay quality, and it pushes the limits of what Minecraft players can achieve. 45 strafing... PvP movement... and not only in the competitive scene... sprint-crouch-jumping to make cool obstacles in SMPs with friends and just playing around with mechanics in a single player world. All of this has been so ingrained in Minecraft gameplay, and it would in my opinion be detrimental to all gameplay, whether it's 1.8 PvP, 1.20 parkour, or casual survival Minecraft. It's like setting up your hotkeys 10 years ago, so used to pressing R to sprint instead of double-tapping W. And then you just change that R key to T. Not a major change (only one key apart), but completely changes the entire gameplay for players.</p>\n<p>I hope this post blows up and these changes don't get implemented.

Maybe casual players wont care, but lots of people who enjoy parkour and pvp will be affected negatively by this. Sprint crouching is so good for parkour and even for survival like when u r sneaking around in an ancient city. Making bridging slower doesnt help anyone. 45 strafes in parkour is something some people have spent hundreds of hours practicing to perfect, so why just randomly remove it now when it hurts nobody? Strafing in pvp is a fundamental mechanic, its pointless to fix it. All these funky mechanics made the game feel more fun. Please mojang listen to your community and revert these changes.</p>",

Mojang makes polls about stupid, silly and unnecessary mobs in the game, but they didnt make a poll about this is what upsets me here, when i joined java community i was like 1.9+ is the better version no need to master 1.8+, both were already split enough but now its gonna be split even more, it's crazy, the logic of mojang. I feel bad for the new players, they will not know the legacy of the great mojang we used to know, also mojang the \"bug\" was in the game for an entire decade, to the point where people were thinking it's a feature and making new discoveries felt so cool, if you're just gonna change everything all of a sudden people might aswell just give up playing minecraft, i started the game for pvp and enjoyment but now if i don't have that then it's useless to have this game in the first place, The years spent for finding a small \"bug\" (i'd rather call it a feature), just made the game a little bit faster, if you're removing it, bedwars will die (i dont even play bedwars but i feel bad for it) and it only gave a 41% boost, some people's channel depend on these small little \"bugs\" (features) and you removing it will ruin their channels it might also be their career. Overall please do not change to these features I reached the max word count.:(</p>",

The new movement changes would be a great addition to the 1.9 combat ruining update.&nbsp;<br>Next, can we please have mining and placing blocks be updated, these mechanics had remained the same since the development builds of the game. They definitely have to go. Maybe, replace them with a fun quick time event, or.. hold key for longer depending on the density of the block. So for example you can place carpets instantly, but you need to hold mouse2 for about 0.715329201 second per block. Then we can introduce a new chestplate enchantment that expands this system. For example, fast placer 5 could reduce the block placing time by 36.8231%.<br><br>On a more serious note: whose idea was this? Fire them, thanks. Have a great day.&nbsp;</p>",

Ach wenn es gerade nichtmal 5000 Leute gibt die es so richtig juckt wenn es erstmal draußen ist hat man (mal wieder) mit einer kleinen Änderung das Spiel versaut. I mean es gibt diesen \"Bug\" schon seit 15 Jahren und er war immer eine Bereicherung. Außerdem ist es DUMM Minecraft realistisch zu machen, weil man dann ja auch gleich Sprintjumping oder andere Dimensionen entfernen müsste. Die Grafik ist ja auch nicht ansatzweise realistisch. Es sind jedoch genau diese Dinge die ein Game zu das machen was es ist und Spaß machen. Und selbst wenn man nur die Phüsik realistisch machen wollen würde, müsste man auch Dinge wie fliegende Bäume oder generell Sachen wie z.B. Wasser \"fixen\".</p>\n<p>BITTE, BITTE, BITTE überlegt nochmal ob es einen Mehrwert bietet oder alle unzufrieden macht. Ich hoffe echt, dass das nur ein schlechter Witz ist.</p>",

Parkour tests limits within the engine, human mind, reaction time and if you wanna make it harder you'd wanna compact it even more to the point where even an accidental 0.000000000001% change in a singular value would break it completely. They were created with this in mind and specifically for these purposes. Do you know how many older parkour courses \"broke\" when Mojang added the ability to sprint in b1.8? But surprise surprise, parkour adapted. It's not some new terrifying concept, it's a well-known thing in the parkour community and if you were really part of it you would know this.</p>\n<p>Some jumps are broken, they'll adapt and be fixed, just like redstone is when there comes an improvement to game performance.

To change a movement style that people enjoy and that the meta has evolved around for the last 15 years is not just negligent, it's absolutely incompetent and malicious. <br><br>To spell this out further:<br><br>1. It's negligent because it utterly disregards the experience and needs of the community at large, as well as the building and parkour communities in particular<br><br>2. It's incompetent because changing a movement that has been established for over 15 years is not something to do on a whim, especially if it doesn't break the game, and you don't do it without extensive investigation as to whether it's even necessary in the first place. Even if somehow it 'broke' the game (WHICH IT DOES NOT), the only competent move would be to reimplement it in a way that doesn't break the game to satisfy all minecraft players, especially the parkour and builder communities.<br><br>3. It's malicious because it ruins one of the fundamental aspect for how all minecraft players interact with the world, and completely destroys the established parkour community meta, and will make building far more tedious for everyone.<br><br>This is a horrid change, and must be reversed if Mojang does not want to be deemed Negligent, Incompetent and Malicious!</p>",

This is going to hurt parkour, speedbriding and pvp communities in Minecraft. Parkour players have spent countless hours perfecting their 45 strafes to make before impossible jumps possible. Ang parkour maps made in this timeframe of 15 years utilizing the use of 45 strafes would be now impossible to beat. Speedbriding is a technique where players require precise timings to place their blocks while shifting, a 40% speed decrease in that is going to be brutal to those who generally play competitive games using briding like bedwars and skywars. For those who spent time perfecting their aim with diagonal moving to get just a little bit more knockback would end. Whether this change gets implemented in the final version or not, its going to be insignificant to an average survival player but will hurt the more competitive side of the game. So when a change is just a net loss for the game, I strictly believe it should not be implemented. On top of all that its not a gamebreaking exploit or something and many games purposefully implement it too. I hope you learned at least something from 1.9 update.&nbsp;</p>",

They need to realize that if \"feature parity\" means making Java Edition worse, then&nbsp;<strong>we don't want it.</strong> The \"unrealistic\" movement difference does nothing but make the game feel better. If it's really that much of a problem for controllers, then have the game detect input method and adjust movement based on that, although even games with controllers have had this sort of thing still be possible without issue (like in most Halo games up until at least Reach (if not later), when holding a heavy weapon that you ripped off of a tripod). Yeah, it's not intended, but it's *fine* and it adds depth to the gameplay. This doesn't just affect competitive players, it affects everyone by removing a cool trick that's fun to use and which could easily be considered an originally-unintended feature instead of a bug.</p>\n<p>Also, on a related note, the fall damage height change is absurd. Why should we *constantly* be taking chip damage and having our hunger bars drained? Do you think that makes the game more fun somehow? There have been other changes made to movement recently as well, such as the \"sprint sneak\" technique being made impossible in a recent main update (which also made movement with an elytra on become incredibly clunky in certain situations). Why? It existed for nearly a *decade* and made the game better and made the game more appealing.</p>",

Yeah, some of these things have been patched out before, and some of them were very niche- a \"crouch-sprint\" thing I saw recently was one, and while that's surely disappointing it can't really be argued it wasn't niche... But such a massive reduction in speed for something as ubiquitous as strafing, after it's been in the game so long, is shortsighted. Even the much more minor nerfs to walking and sprinting are a definitive downgrade. A nerf such as this, bug-fix or not, is just unnecessary and overly damaging to too much.</p>",

Its removal undermines established techniques in:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Parkour: 45-degree strafing allows for accurate jumps and fluid movement across complex obstacle courses. Its removal will drastically increase the difficulty of existing parkour maps and limit future map design.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Speed Bridging: Efficient and competitive speed bridging relies heavily on precise strafing. Removing this mechanic will severely hinder speedrunners and potentially make certain bridging techniques impossible.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * Ace Race: While less crucial than in parkour or speed bridging, 45-degree strafing provides players with more control during flight, allowing for tighter turns and more strategic navigation.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; * PvP Combat: Strafing is a fundamental aspect of PvP, allowing players to dodge attacks and outmaneuver opponents. Its removal will simplify combat and potentially make it less skill-based.</p>\n<p>* Fall Damage After Two Blocks: While seemingly minor, this change significantly impacts the flow of movement and introduces unnecessary punishment for small drops.

I was legitimately excited for the new features before I realized there was secret changes to movement and now it's mixed at best. My question is, why implement a change to something as fundamental as player movement at this point in the game? No one asked for this so the only thing that's going to come out of a movement change is a controversy and more people not wanting to play the game or the newest installations out of frustration. I know you guys want to make the best game possible, but the way to do that is by keeping this bug in the game as a feature, similarly to crawling. All you have to do is remove %100 of these movement changes and I will keep looking forward to the update with excitement. Thanks.</p>",

I can tell you right now, this \"bug\" was <strong>NOT</strong> on most people's radar as a \"problem needing to be fixed.\" Most players probably used it without realizing it. I don't know about you, but when building <strong>large</strong> structures, my <strong>natural reaction</strong> when placing blocks is to hold shift, S, and a strafe key. I do this on <strong>all</strong> of my rooves and a <strong>sizeable chunk</strong> of my walls when building. So, what this \"fix\" <strong>really</strong> does is make a <strong>slow</strong> task even <strong>slower</strong>.<br><br>Parkour courses actually take the blunt of both of these \"fixes\" as <strong>several</strong> movement options and as a result <strong>ENTIRE courses</strong> may no longer possible in newer versions. You could get to a part of a course and suddenly there's an <strong>impossible</strong> move that you <strong>need</strong> to perform but can <strong>no longer</strong> perform.

As for that thingy people complained about where jumping from a 2-block-tall height gives fall damage, luckily I checked in 25w03a and that was actually fixed. At least that's outta the way!</p>\n<p>As for this situation, I never knew the old movement quirks were 'bugs', nor that there was a 'bug report' on this. It seems I had lived with these quirks for many years without even realizing it, but I had zero issues with them! I can only hope this 'bug fix' was actually an honest mistake and not a maliciously-intentional one. I never knew sprint-sneaking was a 'bug' too, and I think I had taken advantage of it without even knowing it. Please revert these changes Mojang, because aside from that, these new snapshots are looking very promising...</p>",

Strafing in new pvp will be killed, so all 1.21 pvp servers can't upgrade their server version, once again disadvantaging players on the new version. Mojang are trying to make the game more realistic and to fix \"bugs\" but if 45 strafing is such a bug then it should've been patched years ago and no one would've even cared. You can't just go and change a well known mechanic of the game and disappoint thousands of people and then claim it was a big problem after 15 years. I strongly recommend everyone to vote to revert this change. Please revert it Mojang!</p>",

It is already a different class of functionality to existing redstone, and does not need to behave like them.

It's also cool in a lore sense - older redstone circuits work slower if not waxed. Not to mention it expands the use cases of the copper bulb with 2gt and 3gt delay possible. It also brings the copper bulb closer to the identity of copper as a material with the oxidation mechanic.</p>",

Whether or not a 1-tick delay is useful in general isn't really relevant to whether the copper bulb should have it or not. The function of a copper bulb is to be a toggleable light source. For manual interaction and using it for that purpose in redstone, 0-tick delay is a better implementation. 1-tick delay created a weird, unnatural delay when interacting normally with the block and was nothing but a decrease in performance for redstone circuits that used the toggle property.</p>\n<p>A potential solution for that could be different delays depending on oxidation state, but I don't really think that's a good idea because then creating a stable redstone device with copper bulbs would require you to make sure all copper bulbs are waxed, which is not an easily visible property.</p>",

No one wants new features that are the same as old features.</p>\n\n<p>Second, if they are going to remove the one tick delay, it would make sense for the following reason: using lots of copper bulbs creates light updates which can cause some lag. For that reason I can see why they might want it to be less useful in redstone. </p>\n\n<p>The issue here is that the redstone community was really hyped because of the one tick delay and taking it away after receiving lots of positive feedback is strange and caused a lot of disappointment.</p>\n\n<p>To make up for this mistake, I suggest one of three changes is made:\n<br />First, they could simply revert the copper bulb to how it was in the first snapshot. (It was great back then)\n<br />Second, they could revert the copper bulb and somehow make it possible to use it in redstone without causing light updates.\n<br />Third, if they aren't going to bring back the one tick delay, at least add a new component that has this functionality (maybe a copper repeater?) Many players were very excited about the one tick delay and it's introduction into the game would definitely have caused a surge in activity within the redstone community and possibly for all types of players.</p>\n\n<p>We want to be heard, so prove that you can hear us.

It doesn't impede the primary functions of the block (lighting and a t flip flop), and instead only adds more use for the more technical players. One tick of delay is not noticeable in any casual or building capacity and will not impact the average user experience negatively or in a way that causes confusion.<br><br>Having blocks that are unique creates new opportunities and fun ways to experiment and play the game.

Second, make the crafter give a signal strength of 10 when all enabled slots have 2 or more items in them. This will give the community something else to look at and may even bring people to be somewhat accepting of the changes that Mojang made.

(also fixing other redstone parity like waterloggable redstone in Java and quasi-connectivity in Bedrock would be nice :D)</p>",

Not only does this 1gt delay allows us redstoners to access this type of delay without the clunky and <strong>unintended</strong> systems used like leafs, scaffolding or even piston firing (this last one barely used because of its rising edge only functionality), but it also allows us to do so in a single block. This single block (with its original functionality) is definitely going to revolutionise 0-tick redstone, so, Mojang PLEASE revert the changes made in 23w46a!!!</p>\n<p>\"... we aim to make the crafter more consistent with other blocks that drop or eject items, and the copper bulb with other blocks that react or change state when a connected redstone signal changes.\" This is NOT a good argument. The fact that redstone is so entertaining is due to components acting in various ways and finding useful connections between them. Making them consistent with each other limits drastically the amount of contraptions and uses this components can have and how they can interact with each other.</p>\n<p>This is not meant to criticise Mojang, but please, do consider reverting this change.</p>",

I know that Bedrock runs on 20 game ticks per second as commands can have gametick delays inputed and it literally says in the interface that 20 ticks is one second.</p>",

        "body": "<p>The old Blast Protection was far superior to the current reworked version because it provided a much more consistent and reliable experience for players. In the past, the knockback reduction from Blast Protection was more effective, ensuring that players could stay on their feet during combat or while navigating explosive situations, such as creeper blasts or TNT. This stability was crucial for survival, especially in high-risk environments like PvP or challenging survival gameplay. With the current rework, however, the knockback reduction stacking is inconsistent, leaving players vulnerable at critical moments when they need it the most. The change diminishes the strategic value of the enchantment, making it feel more like a passive buff rather than a crucial tool for mitigating explosive threats. Many players enjoyed the old system because it offered a clear and dependable advantage, and the new system fails to provide the same level of certainty, causing frustration for those who rely on it in difficult scenarios. Reverting to the old Blast Protection would restore balance and ensure that players can continue to face explosions with confidence.</p>",

While the intention might have been to provide stronger defensive options, completely negating knockback from explosions creates an unintended gameplay imbalance. The lack of knockback makes surviving explosions easier but also removes an important element of positioning and damage mitigation. This is particularly frustrating in PvP and Survival modes, where explosions are a key factor in combat strategy.</p>\n<p data-start=\"599\" data-end=\"937\">Mojang has shown they’re willing to listen to community feedback, as seen with the reversion of the previous enchantment nerfs. A balanced approach—perhaps capping the knockback reduction at a reasonable level instead of outright negating it—would be a much better solution. Hopefully, they take this into account in the next update!\"**</p>\n<p data-start=\"939\" data-end=\"1096\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">This comment acknowledges the issue, provides a logical argument, and encourages Mojang to implement a balanced fix.

While Mojang reverted previous nerfs to protection enchantments, this mechanic remains problematic, disrupting balance, negatively impacting PvP and PvE, and contradicting Mojang’s past design philosophy.</p>\n<p data-start=\"517\" data-end=\"988\">Explosion knockback is a crucial mechanic, providing both defensive and offensive utility. With stacking Blast Protection, players can completely negate knockback, leading to unintended consequences. In PvP, tactics like TNT, beds, and end crystals are weakened, as players remain stationary and unaffected by explosions. In PvE, avoiding explosion damage becomes counterintuitive, as players stay dangerously close to blast sources rather than being knocked to safety.</p>\n<p data-start=\"990\" data-end=\"1267\">Additionally, this change disrupts established gameplay. Players rely on knockback for strategic movement, whether escaping a Creeper blast or using beds for Nether travel. Removing knockback makes certain tactics ineffective, frustrating both casual and competitive players.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1269\" data-end=\"1650\" data-is-last-node=\"\" data-is-only-node=\"\">Mojang has previously balanced enchantments to prevent overpowering mechanics. Past nerfs to Protection stacking ensured fair gameplay, yet this change contradicts that philosophy. Since Mojang has stated plans to rebalance enchantments, now is the time to address this issue. Reverting or reworking the stacking mechanic would restore balance and improve gameplay for all players.</p>",

Reworking or reverting these mechanics would address the potential for overpowered builds, ensure a fairer experience, and promote more diverse strategies. By adjusting how these effects stack or introducing diminishing returns, players would need to consider their defensive choices more thoughtfully, improving overall game balance and encouraging better counter-play and creativity in combat.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mb-2 flex gap-3 -ml-2\" tabindex=\"0\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-start rounded-xl p-1\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mt-3 w-full empty:hidden\">\n<div class=\"text-center\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"absolute\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-center\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</article>\n<div class=\"pointer-events-none h-px w-px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" data-edge=\"true\">&nbsp;</div>",

Here I will provide a more in depth explanation as to why this would be a positive change for the community.</p>\n<p>Double Blast Protection, henceforth referred to as DBP, is a strategy that was pioneered after the 1.21 update which \"fixed\" a game bug with blast protection. The bug I am referring to caused Blast Protection to incorrectly calculate knockback provided by explosions. As the original poster stated, originally, Blast Protection did not negate all knockback from explosions, primarily End Crystals and Respawn Anchors. In a large majority of the players eyes, this was a healthy way that the enchantment functioned, and allowed for skillful expressions of smart positioning to dictate the flow of most fights. However as players have mechanically developed their skills, DBP has allowed for most players to simply ignore decision making and only rush their opponent with no punishment for bad position or decision making.</p>\n<p>I personally have played PvP in this gamemode for multiple years, and believe that the community was much better off before the bug was fixed. I also dont believe that people outside the community would be worse off without the change, as few people outside of the Crystal Community even use the enchantment to the extent where they would benefit from this effect.</p>\n<p>Please consider this when reworking or changing the enchantment, as has been planned.</p>",

I’m writing to express concerns about the recent update affecting Blast Protection and how it has rendered crystal PvP nearly impossible. As a dedicated player, I’ve thoroughly enjoyed the strategic depth of crystal PvP, which has added excitement and skill to Minecraft’s combat.</p>\n<p data-start=\"513\" data-end=\"985\">Crystal PvP is unique because it requires players to combine tactics, positioning, and quick thinking. The use of end crystals added an additional layer of strategy, making PvP more engaging. However, the new update, which makes Blast Protection severely limit or negate the effectiveness of crystals, has undermined this aspect of the game. Many players now find crystal PvP frustrating or unplayable, as the strategy behind using crystals has been significantly reduced.</p>\n<p data-start=\"987\" data-end=\"1359\">While I understand the need for balance, I feel this change was too drastic and removed an essential component of the PvP experience for many players. I believe adjusting the effectiveness of Blast Protection against crystals could restore balance without removing crystal PvP entirely. This would allow players to continue enjoying a more strategic, dynamic combat style.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1361\" data-end=\"1558\">I hope Mojang considers community feedback and finds a solution that ensures a balanced and enjoyable experience for all playstyles. Thank you for your time and for continuing to improve Minecraft.</p>\n<p data-start=\"1560\" data-end=\"1612\">Sincerely,<br data-start=\"1570\" data-end=\"1573\">qoloc</p>",

This system fostered strategic gameplay, especially in PvP scenarios, where players could use knockback to their tactical advantage, like knocking opponents off ledges or into traps. The new knockback system, however, introduced changes that made trajectories less predictable and reduced combat fluidity. These alterations have impacted the balance and enjoyment of gameplay, making it harder for players to plan their actions and reducing knockback's effectiveness as a strategic tool. Many players feel the old system offered a better, more enjoyable experience and are advocating for its return to restore consistency, balance, and the fun that knockback mechanics once brought to Minecraft.</p>\n</div>\n<div id=\"pFW7WWj2CKEgk1ZBieUT6-content-1\" class=\"space-y-3 break-words\"></div>\n</div>",

Almost all you need to do to be good with this change is have fast toteming and fast anchors. You can see that when you have a fight against double blast prot you use little to no crystals, I thought we were playing crystal pvp not anchor pvp. Also in my opinion this pretty much meant for cheaters because like i said, you really just need fast toteming&nbsp; and anchors and WHAT DO CHEAT CLIENTS PROVIDE? exactly so it makes it really inconsistent and unfair for fights so me and many others are PRAYING that this change gets removed not only from the tier list but also the game altogether.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you made it to the end thank you so much &lt;3</p>",

        "body": "<p class=\"\" data-start=\"62\" data-end=\"403\">As an active Crystal PvP player, I strongly support reverting the current Blast Protection knockback stacking and bringing back the old knockback system. The previous knockback made PvP feel fast-paced, skill-based, and fun. Explosion knockback was essential for movement, combos, and quick decision-making — all of which are now diminished.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"405\" data-end=\"715\">With just two pieces of Blast Protection, players now take zero knockback from crystals. This completely removes a key aspect of Crystal PvP. Fights feel static, less intense, and less rewarding. Instead of using skillful movement to outplay your opponent, players now just tank explosions while barely moving.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"717\" data-end=\"963\">The change also makes the game feel unintuitive. Explosions should move players — that’s what makes them feel impactful. Without that, PvP becomes awkward and frustrating, especially for newer players who are still learning how to react and move.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"965\" data-end=\"1209\">Mojang has already shown they’re open to community feedback by reverting earlier protection nerfs. Now is the perfect time to fix this too. Please consider reverting the knockback stacking or reworking it in a way that keeps PvP movement alive.</p>\n<p class=\"\" data-start=\"1211\" data-end=\"1293\">Bring back the old knockback. Let Crystal PvP stay fun, competitive, and skillful.</p>",

I'm aware that the texture of copper grates looks small and so it makes not a lot of sense for most items to fall through but this is what we have to work with, and i feel like having this feature along side the water currents thing makes sense since it gives the block some pretty good farm and redstone applications, And items when in item form tend to have different properties than they do when placed out into the world so clearly items function a little differently in item form so this could work at a stretch. Maybe Mojang could slightly modify the blocks texture to make this mechanic make more sense but if they didn't, i wouldn't complain, Minecraft was never the most realistic or grounded game to begin with and it's not trying to be, it wears it's status as a video game on it's sleeve.</p>",

I can't tell you the amount of times i have been paranoid that my bees might accidentally fly into the campfire under their hive due to a momentary lapse in pathfinding and set themselves on fire, so a block that prevents them from going near, and creates a safe floor for players to walk over but still allows the smoke to rise through and keep the bees from going agro when i go to get honey would be extremely useful.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Hey I thought this was included already but I tested it before I implemented it, with the addition of items flowing through the grate we don't have to use a clunky piston extention in order to move items but not stop fall damage in a spawner setting. If items were to go through there could be water flowing as usual underneath as a streamlined way into the water and into a sorting machine. I'm not sure the real use of liquids going through but items would make this block variant HUGE! I mean we got the crafter and that has extremely neich uses like reducing storage of an iron farm by nine, but honestly it's just isn't very practical, just letting items through the grate would be a better addition to the game, more usable (the crafter is very sore spot, I wish it had blacklist so we could sort using a crafter that doesn't get powered, allowing tighter sorting systems with up to 9 items instead of 1 per \"unit\" and spaced one block as it has to be currently, may also allow solid items to be sorted, say a gold helmet is blacklisted and then that slot only holds those. I know it changes the purpose but I don't see an actual filter making the cut so don't let the crafter go to waste make it.. good 😅 sorry very long winded I hope I'm not rubbing you guys the wrong way with a \"lack of creativity\" it's more a lack of space 😅 Op doesn't do farm often and the idea still came to mind, let our creativity flow 👀 and I didn't mean to speak on the crafter, I apologize.</p>",

I have a few suggestions that I think would make it more powerful.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- Give the Mace a splash damage attack similar to the sweeping attack of the sword, but it is triggered when striking an enemy from a 5 block fall or higher. The attack will damage enemies within a small radius. Add an enchantment to expand this radius and the damage dealt with the splash damage.</p>\n<p>- I watched a bit of PhoenixSC's stream. In the stream, he was able to 1 shot the wither from 100 or 200 blocks up (I forget which) and negate all fall damage. I think this is a good concept, but it needs to be changed. I would change it to reduce X percent of fall damage instead of 100%. I also think the maximum amount of damage should be capped, however that's much less of an issue in my opinion.</p>\n<p>- I have not tested this yet so I do not know if this is already a feature, but I think the mace should have the ability to disable shields like the axe, but it should also have an enchantment that allows it to disable shields for longer OR deal X percent of damage through shields.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think this is going to be one of the most unique weapons in the game, and I think these changes will help keep it from becoming obsolete in the late game, and in PvP. Thank you for taking the time to read this suggestion! I hope you will continue to add weapons with unique mechanics!</p>",

Why dedicate my hotbar slot to an item that <em>might </em>save me from fall damage but only if I'm lucky enough be landing right on top of a mob (and how often does that actually happen by accident?). Why not instead dedicate that hotbar slot to a better safety item like a water bucket, ender pearl, breeze ball, totem of undying, chorus fruit, etc?</p>\n<p>I think some sort of \"Impact\" enchantment or property would prove useful as a sort of \"passive fall damage negator.\" Like, if you fall while holding a mace with this \"Impact\" enchantment, it will negate your fall damage even if you don't strike a mob&nbsp;<em>but</em> it shreds the mace's durability. So it's obvs still ideal to hit a mob as you fall but in the (common) situations when that's not an option (or you just miss), at least the mace does something and doesn't leave you regretting not reaching for the water bucket instead.</p>",

This is the first time since my childhood that combat in this game has truly excited me!</p>\n<p><strong>Wind Charges</strong>&nbsp;NEED to be more accessible. With the current state of the trial chambers, wind charges are a fairly rare consumable that makes this weapon VERY impractical. With every other weapon, if it requires an ammo, it is craft-able and the mace should be given the same treatment. I believe that the wind charges should be treated as ammo to the mace, as using the mace without the wind charges just makes it a regular weapon with a negligible perk. <strong>Without wind charges, there is very little incentive to acquire and use this weapon.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Alongside this, I suggest that perhaps the mace could actually use <strong>wind charges as ammo and can right-click to shoot them</strong> (like the trident) It would need to be instant like throwing them in your off-hand, otherwise there is no point in using the feature.</p>\n<p><strong>Breeze Rods </strong>need more uses. Blaze rods obviously serve the major purpose of reaching the end through crafting the eyes of ender. Converting those rods into blaze powder interacts with the entirety of the potion crafting system, as well as reaching the end. This cements blaze rods as a powerful resource that has a great incentive to gather in decent quantities. but breeze rods currently only serve the purpose of crafting the mace.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I have opinions about the relating mechanics, but I'll stop here</p>",

As the one-shot requires a lot of setup, it's not OP &amp; swords are still preferable most of the time.</p>\n<p>There's flaws however; <strong>it needs to be renewable and enchantable with unbreaking/mending.</strong> This item will create scarcity issues in servers, where if you lose it, it's gone forever, especially when worlds are limited due to file sizes. Add the heavy core on the spawner loot table, with low % chance. Alternatively, make vaults repeatable for each player, encouraging more gameplay in limited worlds, as the keys are useless!</p>\n<p>Mace is good on Java as you can dual-wield with wind charges, but that's impossible on Bedrock. On mobile especially, it's impossible to quick-swap from wind charge/mace on your hotbar. We really need a button to instantly activate items in our hotbar. For example, if you have a wind charge on slot 1 while equipping your mace on slot 2, after pressing this button, it'll immediately activate the slot 1 item and go back to your mace. Switching hotbar items on mobile like torches is sluggish without this! And add buttons that let us craft-all or take all furnace items, on mobile you have to click 64+ times to craft stacks, which is painful.</p>\n<p>Wind charges still need to be easily farmable without waiting. <strong>Minecraft has a problem where some consumables (like lingering pots &amp; tipped arrows) are so hard to get that it becomes unused.</strong></p>",

I would rather see it be made a bit more difficult to obtain than see it be made less powerful. That or, even just removing some of the extraneous features of it, such as negating fall damage or knocking away other entities. Maybe just a damage reduction would be more reasonable? Or, have a limit to how much of the calculated fall damage is negated, so if you fall far enough you're still going to end up taking fall damage? There are other methods players have to deal with fall damage, after all.</p>\n<p>Mainly, I don't want to see the damage nerfed into the ground. If it ends up only ever doing as much or less damage as other weapons, then it probably wouldn't be worth all the effort to obtain. If that change was made, it would at best be a way to very situationally MLG off a random mob to avoid fall damage. At that point, a water bucket and an axe would be better to have on hand.</p>",

The breeze rod should craft something else wind related like a staff that shoots wind with a cooldown of like 2 seconds and do the same thing as the wind charges but a bit better and more powerful. The mace should have a slow attach speed but deal more damage than a diamond sword. I think if you craft diamonds with heavy cores it should make a heavy diamond core and that should make either a more powerful mace or a big sword that does more damage than a normal one. It would be slower but deal more damage. I also think adding a water and earth variant if the breeze/blaze mob sub type. </p>",

I had lost hope considering how modern Mojang felt pacified recently, with the removal of goat muttons and fireflies, how minecraft live felt too childish, it felt like it's heading towards something bizarre and unfun, but I'm glad I was wrong. Ironically, kids are the types of players that are most excited about cool new weapons like the mace, if we look at the first 20 pages of the \"new\" 1.21 suggestions, we have so many interesting ideas from them like kraken enemies with tentacle weapon drop, chinese dragon bosses, underwater trial chambers, the list goes on.</p>\n<p>Now for mace feedback, I prefer it to be overpowered, rather than it being underpowered and useless like most items on minecraft, like crossbows and tridents. Java's trident should be buffed like bedrock. Right now, mace seems it's going to be so rare that players won't know about its existence, like turtle helms. I'd make it just a little bit more common and farmable. Mace needs wind charges to be used effectively, but charges are too difficult to get. I had hoped the new weapon is more of a movement tool like wind wands or grappling hooks. Perhaps since the mace is made out of breeze rods, it can also shoot infinite wind charges if it smacks the ground, but with long cooldown?</p>\n<p>I hope there will be more creative weapons and armor in the next updates, this is exciting for the community and it makes me want to play again.</p>",

Though I'd probably put max damage per-hit caps on bosses, like maybe ender dragon can only take a maximum of 100 damage per hit, to prevent oneshotting bosses..

It means that a mob will be \"dizzy\" for a brief moment, not attacking the player. And for the player, it means the attack gauge bar taking longer to fill (similar to what mining fatigue does) for a brief moment! (So that you have time to escape the horde!) Scales with the level of the enchantment!</p>\n<p><strong>Strike: (Lvls 1-5)</strong></p>\n<p>Increases damage done to directly hit mob by 10% per level, and deals 10% of damage to indirectly hit mobs (this makes it easier to kill the horde, as it's no longer just eliminating them one at a time!)</p>\n<p><strong>Combo (Lvl 1 only)</strong></p>\n<p>This makes it so that if you successfully land a hit on something with the mace on your way down from a fall, you get boosted back up, so you can go in for another hit without using another wind charge. (Because let's face it, the last thing a player wants is to use up all their wind charges in one session in order to use the mace. This makes it so that if you have skill, you can land multiple blows without using your whole stash of wind charges.)</p>\n<p><strong>Strike and clash should be mutually exclusive.</strong></p>\n<p>Anyways, Thanks!</p>",

But it should have enchantments to improve this dmg, have some damage on the area of knockback, maybe the more close to the hit mob, the more damage. If not, it will not be used on late game. A thing that would be great is that connecting a critical hit with the mace, make you the next jump to make a super jump, maybe consuming windcharges in your inventory like the arrows of bows to make it more balanced. This would help on using the mace eficiently without getting crazy in the process and be able to get a streak of crits making it more balanced in front of other weapons like swords, which can upgrade their damage with enchantments; maces can't. If the mace is not balanced enough in order to make it have (with all enchants or mecanics added, and on full late game player) a similar dps to a fully enchanted nthrite swrd (the same late game player), the mace will not be used so much. Something similar hapens to the tridnt, which is not used to fight because its dmg is not comparable to enchanted swords and bows. It would be great for tridents to have increasing damage enchantments (like sharpness that doesn't matter the enemy, the increase of damage exists), maybe separated between close combat and ranged combat, to make it more comparable to swords and bows. Also the mace should have a slower attack speed, like axes, but having similar dps (1 attack per second but 11 dmg, instead of 1.6 attacks per second and 7 dmg</p>",

It's great how a good wind charge + mace attack rewards the player with more damage than a sharpness V netherite axe, though it's unlikely to happen. We'd have to create arenas exclusive for maces to prevent players from just spamming common weapons. It's too bad that mace arenas are impossible to do in survival servers due to limited mace and wind charge uses.</p>\n<p>As others said, maces will be hard to use in bedrock without dual wielding. It's not just mobile, consoles and even PC need a shortcut button to quickly activate hotbar items like wind, pearls, etc. See xisuma's \"Minecraft 1.20 inventory update\" and jump to simple idea #1 on 4:48, this'll make gameplay smooth on bedrock, and solves inventory issues.</p>\n<p>Mojang has been cooking lately, it's changing for the better and I'm glad the team takes more risks to add fun content, and making the trial chambers rewarding. \"Fun\" and \"rewarding\" needs emphasis. These last few years, youtubers often make fun clickbait content like \"trial keys opening deep dark portal\", or update news showing cool new weapons. Even if mojang doesn't promise it, kids are tricked regardless into believing the next updates are great, then get disappointed. Fortunately, 1.21 is looking decent and might escape this fate.</p>\n<p>Minecoins might be controversial, but I know it's income for mojang to keep making updates, and I'll support the game by buying addons if the team keeps making vanilla fun.</p>",

Remove the incremental xp cost and \"too expensive\" feature, and just let players repair their weapons without needing mending. This will also make the weak books like prot1 worth collecting, players can combine the books until prot4 without it being \"too expensive\". This way, players are not forced to abuse villagers and get OP prot4 immediately, and it'll give more depth to minecraft's progression. I'd argue that the powerful books like prot4 should only be obtainable/craftable on nether/end trial chambers, as it's too easy to start a game and get instantly OP by fishing &amp; trading on villages. Heck, maybe there's another heavy core on nether trial chambers to combine with blaze rods! If we're adding unique enchants on these maces, add elemental attacks where you can use the breeze rod handle to fire wind charges. Mace gameplay will be easier for non-PC players if we can use the winds without switching/crowding the hotbar!</p>",

All the mechanics are super cool, but Mojang should add animations on when the player hits a mob/another player when landing (huge amount of block crumbs in the range of 2-3 blocks around the place of impact would be enough). The best space for new ideas and imagination is definitely the enchantments area, since good and creative enchantments for the weapon would add much more originality and meaning to it. I won't go through any possibilities for cool enchantments, since I trust Mojang in making this sphere beneficial for the Mace. Maybe they will be able to give Amethyst and other items with high potential more functionality using this weapon, atleast decorative...\n<br />Overall there are plenty of possibilities, and I wish you luck in making the Mace a worthy addition to the game, Mojang!</p>",

With this enchantment you will fall faster and deal more damage.

This will make the mace more suitable for surprise combat, and will also allow it to be used against shields. You can also add an enchantment for this, which slows down the enemy after his shield is knocked down. the name of this enchantment could be \"stun\" or \"armor-piercing\". It's make Mace more effective than axes<br>3. Add a 3D model to the mace. due to the fact that it is flat, it is impossible to accurately define and understand its entire volume and mass. <br>4.

A mace has flanged edges, allowing the mace to cleave through armor easily! However, the Heavy Core doesn't have knobs or spikes. This means that it's more of a hammer. Ideal name changes could fall among the lines of Heavy Hammer or the Mallet.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">-As for enchantments, the Mace should have the basic ones, like mending and unbreaking, however, I thought of a few more. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Channeling would summon lightning on whatever you hit, so long as you fell from a height of more than 3 blocks.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ascension (I-III) would grant you bonus height for a landed strike. 2 blocks of additional height for Ascension I, 6 for III. Treasure enchantment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knockback scales how far a mob is repulsed.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sweeping edge changes the mace's behavior to a lateral attack that repulses mobs in front of you. It makes it a heavy sword with the Java sword slash. The mace's slash would be slower and harder hitting, not requiring height to function optimally. Additionally, Sweeping edge mace would do big damage to armor, specifically the chestplate. This would be pretty big for PvP and PvE would benefit greatly as well.</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br></span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Welp. That's all the characters I have today. Thanks for reading my news article of an idea and I hope you have a great day!</span></p>",

If you were to expand the area in which you could successfully strike, even in different shapes for different weapons and tools (represented by, perhaps, a bigger crosshair with a different shape), it would make the game's combat more accessible, dynamic and rewarding. </span></span></p>\n<p>Beyond that, the mace feels really good to use, because it makes you think with your terrain, and is situational. That's just good game design. I fear there will be a temptation to nerf it or put a damage cap on it, because it feels very powerful, but the high-risk high-reward nature of the weapon is <em>why it works</em>. The community really likes this, because it's bold, unique, new and powerful. Show us more like this, but please, please don't make us repair it in an anvil. That's silly. Mending and Unbreaking can be applied to anything with durability, even shields. You can enchant a BRUSH. Let us enchant the mace.</p>\n<p>I also agree with the consensus of making it 3D, because it's just odd in its current state.</p>",

It can be used in various scenarios such as with wind charges and Elytra, or simple jumping from higher terrain. </p>\n\n<p>However really powerful option is that you can build up several blocks high and one shot power mobs like the Wither and Warden. There is of course a huge risk in doing so, but with items like totems, feather falling, and placing water it can reduce the risk significantly. </p>\n\n<p>I wanted to look at ways to balance the Mace. Yes it is a 2.22% chance of getting a core and can't be enchanted, but I think the weapon itself still needs to be balanced.</p>\n\n<p>I strongly believe however a strict damage cap is NOT the way to go. I see too possible ways that both can work well. One is too have have the additional damage dealt each block you fall decrease. Maybe a logarithmic relationship between rate of change of damage and blocks fallen, you still can do insane damage it just takes more effort.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea I think can work is the more you fall the more durability the Mace looses. Falling from a height tall enough to kill a Warden should leave 75% of durability for example. Perhaps the durability can be slightly increased to account for this change.</p>\n\n<p>This is a great and fun item, and I would like it to still be fun in the final release while also being balanced. It is quite the difficult task I know, but I think that it can be done and doing so would truly help make the Mace a exceptionally special addition to Minecraft </p>",

Overall, it has potential, but currently it is not a viable weapon to replace the sword or the bow. Similar to the crossbow, it has been around for years and (in 90% of cases) is inferior to the bow; similarly, the mace, as it is now, does not replace the sword. It seems more like a PvP weapon or for extremely specific cases, but with that damage and durability, and without being able to be enchanted, it is not a viable weapon today for end-game survival. Honestly, I trust (although with Mojang it can sometimes be difficult) that they will work to improve the weapon so it can compete with the sword in normal use. If they improve it, it could be a very good weapon; otherwise, it will remain in the drawer with the crossbow or the trident, which nobody uses in the day-to-day of a survival game.</p>\n<p>And it wouldn't really be conceptually very difficult to improve the mace to make it a wonderful weapon. At the very least, it should support Unbreaking and Mending, and Looting would be quite nice because otherwise it would be quite inconsistent with the sword. And then, by making it like the sword and having, for now, one type of enchantment for damage and one type of enchantment to enhance the special ability, would be sufficient; then you can work on rarer things that would also be very good, but for now, this would be enough, I think.</p>",

In an ordinary singleplayer world, a Diamond or Netherite Sword with all the usual enchantments like Smite and Looting is fine enough, and the Mace currently feels a bit situational.</p>\n<p>It's perfectly reasonable that you can't increase its damage through enchantments given how powerful its main ability can potentially be. However, I feel like you should still be able to at least put enchantments like unbreaking and mending on it, seeing as you only have a 2.2% chance to get a heavy core from a vault, and the actual weapon's durability isn't too great. Also I feel like you should be able to put looting on it. Ever since the Looting enchantment was added to the game, Swords are the only weapon that has ever made use of it, and having another weapon that could make use of Looting would breathe some more life into that enchantment.<br>This weapon could also make great use of the knockback enchantment, as it's ground-slam shockwave could push enemies even further away, making it even greater for crowd control.</p>\n<p>I also think the Mace should be a 3D model when held, and a sprite in the inventory like the Trident. The Mace looks rather odd when held as it currently is.</p>\n<p>The Mace is a very interesting and unique idea, but it could be so much more, and I am really looking forward to seeing what becomes of it in the near future.

Why not make it a classic weapon crafted with 2 sticks and 5 gold/planks/cobblestone/iron/diamond around stick in central slot or just make the mace drop from loot case, not a part of it? We currently have 2 types of weapons: craftable (example: sword) and trophy (example: trident), these is why using heavy core in crafting mace feels like using Totem of undying or Enchanted gold apple to craft something - very weird.\n<br />Theres no reason for heavy core to exist as separate item, it has no uses other than crafting mace or building in creative mode. I also dont understand using any type of road as a handle, if you're able to turn them into wind charges with bare hands, they are really brittle and unstable. It's not possible for them to hold anything heavy, not to mention that mace needs to be really strong to stand crushing blows it does.\n<br />2. Heavy core is 3D itself, but the mace is flat. Make it at least 5 pixel wide.\n<br />3. Heavy core's texture is overdetailized, that makes it look like small polished rock, but in reality rocks cant be used to make maces, because they are dense, but brittle. Smoother texture, maybe like magnetite would look better for it.</p>",

I honestly do not see myself using the mace and the slam attack. I don't see myself carrying it around. The slam attack would also be really hard to effectively use in multiplayer settings. I also think the slam attack is hard to use, and the mace is useless besides the slam attack.</p>\n<p>I say the slam attack be left as is for players with high skill to pull it off, but the mace should be more viable as a normal weapon. For bedrock edition, just simply increase the damage. For Java edition, change up the damage and cooldown to not be identical to another weapon, but in a way the damage per second is higher.</p>\n<p>Besides just a simple damage increase, like I mentioned above, you could also do some other things that can differentiate it from other weapons. First, make it have a very big sweeping attack by default, without the sweeping edge enchantment. A higher sweeping would also make this very useful in the Trial Chambers. Second, increase its knockback.</p>\n<p>Overall, the mace is a very cool weapon with a lot of potential, but does not justify obtaining one. I feel my suggested changes will make it more overall useful, fit with the weapon's design, and fit into vanilla Minecraft. Thank you for reading!</p>",

This can be frustrating for those who are unlucky.</p>\n<p>2. Add an upper limit to the damage. That would prevent instant kills on Ender Dragons and Wardens.</p>\n<p>3. Add new enchantments. I like ideas like Leeching, where you would get some health back and make it more ideal. Charge, where you would charge a melee attack up close instead of getting high up and jumping. And Tempest, where you would have more knockback on nearby enemies based on the enchantment level.</p>\n<p>4. Incearse the durability by a lot. Repairing it with the anvil will take too many levels down the road. It's like you would need mending to use it with its current durability. It would make sense to have high durability because it's thicker than any other weapons we use.</p>\n<p>Thank You Mojang!</p>",

        "body": "<p>Unlike what some people say, I don’t think the mace is overpowered.</p>\n<p>Not only does it have to be a fall(no elytra flying into a hit) it also needs to be a high fall to take out high hp mobs. So to use an elytra with this you need to un-equip the elytra mid-air in order to hit or you can fly straight down which is as risky as a fall. Not only mentioning that in survival reaching those heights to hit boss mobs without an elytra is time consuming.</p>\n<p>To be honest, if you’re late enough in the game to have an elytra or cage a warden, the mace is more situationally OP compared to some other weapons you’d have at the time. Also hitting from a high fall also takes some skill, that also balances the weapon. <br><br>My suggestion is that in order to add to the heavy vibe of the mace is to decrease the attack speed to 0.9. Then to increase the base damage to 9. This makes more sense in my mind with how a mace should be in Java. In Bedrock keeping it as the way it is already should do no harm. The only nerf it might need is not being able to fly with it with an elytra. This would still keep with the heavy vibe and nerf it so it isn’t too OP in combat.</p>",

It’s fun and rewarding and isn’t too game breaking since most mobs can already be cheesed with other, typically easier / safer methods. Attack speed could be lowered since the weapon would be so heavy, which helps its base level be more distinct from a diamond sword. It should also disable shields.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For PvP, the mace may be a bit OP, especially if the player is ambushed. Instead of capping the damage I’d rather give it a soft counter: the turtle shell helmet. How it would work is similar to dog armour since they are both made from scute. It would tank 100% of the smash attack at the cost of durability. The helmet may break fairly easily, but it will save the player from being one-shot killed at the cost of being less protective in general compared to diamond / netherite. It even makes some intuitive sense since the turtle shell helmet is worn on the head and the mace attacks from above. It could also offer protection from falling anvils and dripstone.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I’d also love to see some enchantments for the mace. A channeling like enchantment would be super fun. There could also be a blowback or shockwave enchantment that damages the nearby mobs and increases their knocked back from the smash attack. Perhaps a shattering enchantments that deals increased damage to armour and shields.</p>",

My opinion on the sprite is that it is clean and looks great. It does a great job at conveying the materials of the mace to the player wielding it, but is not easily readable to other players. Due to the flat nature of the sprite, the mace is not easy to distinguish at certain angles and does not do a great job at conveying it's size and strength to other players. This is especially problematic for a weapon as potentially powerful as the mace. In addition, the flat nature of the design does not fit with the mace as a weapon. The other weapons in Minecraft do have flat designs, however these are all flat weapons/tools in the real world (e.g. sword, axe, shovel, trident, etc.).</p>",

I wouldn't want to bring it with me unless I had a spare in fear of losing it if I die. It should be behind a boss or mini boss you can resummon, like how you can resummon the Ender Dragon. That way it is challenging to get, but based on skill instead of luck.</li>\n<li>It would look way better with a 3D model.</li>\n<li>It should have a shockwave particle effect when hitting with a smash. Also, should be able to do lesser damage to surrounding mobs. (Damage could be a enchantment)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As for enchantments, there should be three, like with the crossbows and trident. They could be Splash Damage (listed above), Bounce (hitting a area at least 4x4 horizontally while jumping launches you into the air similar to a wind charge), and Absorption (killing a mob with a smash attack heals you half the mobs total health). Bounce would also fix the fact that Bedrock can't do the wind charge combo with an off hand wind charge, instead switching active slots.</p>",

Maybe we are able to craft two breeze charges INTO a breeze rod, or scrap the rod altogether and make the mace a drop itself from the vault, simplifying things, but also giving the artists more flexibility to design the mace. Me personally, I didn't realize that it was a heavy core as the head of the mace, because of the pixel art.</p>\n<p>Also, about the 3D thing. Another user commented and said that technically the trident isn't 3D, simply it has a different model in your hand then the inventory sprite. I do think it would good it 3D, but it could potentially be very bulky onscreen. But I do think some way to make the edges of the model more square instead of diagonal pixels would help a lot.</p>\n<p>Wind charges paired with the Mace are a great idea, but bedrock players don't exactly get the luxury of doing that, because of the offhand feature being exclusive to Java. Maybe this is when we fix this parity feature between both versions (banner shields came last update, that was a parity) and allow bedrock to have anything in offhand (which I'm sure the community would welcome), OR allow breeze charges in your offhand like arrows or a shield.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A custom animation for swinging (1st and 3rd person) the mace would probably do wonders for this weapon, but also a custom cooldown.</p>",

Speaking of enchantments, I do think that unbreaking and mending should be able to applied to the Mace, but <strong>not</strong> damage enchantments.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maybe have a shockwave effect, even if you miss. To fix this looking weird, maybe it could only work if you are on the ground, and a custom animation could be implemented where your character slams the Mace on the ground. Also, a damage cap would be nice, and maybe the more damage = more durability taken away, up to a certain point. <em>Don't want to go around 1 shotting enemies from 50 blocks up and then your mace breaks in 3 hits.</em></p>\n<p>I think wind charges could play a bigger role with the Mace. Instead of having the wind charges in your offhand slot, just leave them in your inventory. Now, whenever you right click, your hammer quickly smashes the ground and you get <strong>boosted up</strong>, using up a wind charge. This \"boost\" ability has the same cooldown as if you were using a wind charge from you hand, and is separate from the normal slow attack cooldown. This will allow players to still hold a totem of undying, like in hardcore worlds<em> (which will be in both versions soon)</em>, but also have the mace be an <strong>out-of-combat tool </strong>for maneuverability, like climbing mountains or scaling walls quickly. This would make pre-elytra traveling easier and much more fun.&nbsp;</p>",

Breach in PvE is also rather useless, so adding an armored arthropod miniboss in the future will give them value.</p>\n\n<p>Heavy core rarity is horrible now that it's only dropped on ominous vaults, we'd need to explore tons of chunks. For Bedrock players, we have this trend of \"skipping\" updates, not playing the game to save chunks for future updates. Console/mobile simply can't handle 5-10GB saves as they'll corrupt, so please don't force players to explore. I'm glad I skipped playing 1.20 as trims require exploring large chunks, but I fear I'd have to skip 1.21 as well, unless I cheat the mace in somehow. I don't mind maces being rare but I just wish the vaults/mace are farmable to make keys useful, I had hoped the chambers are a repeatable activity.

You can one tap players with prot 4 netherite from like 6 blocks up with a fully enchanted mace. That is not a fun combat system. On top of that, it devalues swords and axes. It feels like the mace is trying to be a replacement weapon, when it really should not. The dropping down from above idea is neat, and works well in certain situations, and that's a good thing. The mace should not be an end all be all. That is the sword's job. Breach is a neat idea, but too op. Also, the mace should have a really long cooldown, longer then the axe. I think bringing breach down to 5 or 10 percent reduction and giving it a long cooldown would make the mace a great way to start and and fights. A surprise smash and a final hit. This would integrate it well into the established combat system, without ruining the sword. The sword is good for damage, the axe disables shields, the trident is good for underwater movement, and the mace is good for one surprise smash attack.</p>",

Axes would be good to have a shared enchantment that isn't necessarily with the Sword.</p>\n<p>Also the&nbsp;<strong>Density</strong> Enchantment needs to have some drawbacks for the Maces when enchanted. The main gimmick is that the higher the level the more&nbsp;<em>Fall Damage</em> it can do when hitting a mob from fall height. With the&nbsp;<em>Base Damage&nbsp;</em>of the Mace unaffected, it would make this enchantment feel like it is something that you will need it as a necessity rather than a choice and is too desirable and overpowered as it is. I think the best way to balance it out is to have the&nbsp;<em>Base Damage</em> decrease as you increase the level of the enchantment. That way if you owned multiple of them, you can have a Mace that is good for combatting multiple mobs and a Mace that is good for wiping out a single mob but would be terrible in combatting. It would kinda feel like a curse, but this enchantment adds the&nbsp;<strong>risk-reward</strong> element that no many enchantments would have, and with this update - you need the risk-reward elements in there.</p>",

Here’s some examples that many others have also pointed out:\n<br />-One shots any mob, aside from armored wolves, mobs holding totems, and armor stands\n<br />-Kills a player with full Protection 4 Netherite when dropping not even 20 blocks. An unarmored player won’t die if they miss their attack, but any player being attacked will. Note that this is an unenchanted mace, the height needed to kill a maxed out player will be a lot lower if you enchant it. The reward is so high with little risk\n<br />-No damage cap, unlike other things that use gravity to deal damage (anvil and dripstone)\n<br />-Slow falling does not affect the mace at all, removing risk and allows easier attacks</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, the mace needs both a damage cap and a damage reduction. Also, the fact that it negates fall damage entirely is absurd and doesn’t make sense. As other people have suggested, there are ways to fix this:\n<br />-the mace only reduces a %of fall damage\n<br />-damage cap, maybe 20 hearts to match dripstone and anvils\n<br />-damage based on how fast you’re falling, not height\n<br />-durability damage based on damage you deal\n<br />-reducing damage per block fallen\n<br />-nerf damage increase by Density enchantment\n<br />-nerf Breach enchantment’s ability to ignore armor by up to 60%</p>\n\n<p>To those of you that argue that you need setup to deal massive damage, jumping+right clicking with a wind charge is barely “setup”. That allows you to 2-shot Protection 4 netherite users</p>",

But density is also starting to look useless with the nerfs, and as for smite I'm better off using a smite axe. Having all these enchants on the mace is not as overpowered as you think, as they're all very situational and weak in survival.</li>\n<li>What I really don't like about the changes, is that now you're kinda forced to jump from insane heights to kill, which is a horrible idea on hardcore mode, or even normal survival as you'll die. Before this change, the mace can deal reasonable damage by dropping shorter distances due to the base damage and pre-nerf density. But now it needs lethal drops not viable in normal gameplay, as you need to first set-up a high block tower, or find some crazy elevated terrain. I'm better off just killing the mob with my sword instead of doing unnecessary tasks like that.</li>\n</ol>",

I have 2 suggestions, however, that I think would benefit this great new addition.</p>\n<p>Firstly, I think that the recent nerf to the Wind Burst enchantment can be tweaked a bit. In the latest preview (1.21.0.24), a player must fall- from my approximations- about 3 blocks or so. This is ok, however, I think that this should only apply to Wind Burst I, while Wind Burst II maybe has the player fall 1.5 blocks, and Wind Burst III only requires that a critical hit or a fall of 1 block be performed.</p>\n<p>I think that these changes would give players more incentive to seek out Wind Burst III and give each level more of its own unique quirk to them.</p>\n<p>Secondly, I would make it that to craft a mace, 2 breeze rods are required, as opposed to the current singular rod. This is simply for the fact that for other tools in the game, 2 sticks are required to craft, so it makes sense that the mace, too, would require 2 materials to craft its handle.</p>\n<p>Other than those 2 things, I really think that this feature is a genuine fun feature to play around with and I cannot wait to see what the rest of the community does with the mace upon full release!</p>",

        "body": "<p>I think that the current state of the mace in its base, unenchanted form has been nerfed far too heavily and it is no longer a niche side-grade to swords and axes like the trident is. The DPS on the ground is akin to a stone shovel and is far worse than an unenchanted trident (which comes from the easier, more abundant form of vaults I may add).<br><br>I just tested against a stand-in for a full prot 4 netherite player. (java edition btw) The mace with breach 4 kills the player a whole 10 seconds slower than a sharp 5 netherite sword when using normal attacks, and 7 seconds slower when using critical attacks. This performance is on par with a sharpness 1 iron sword, which is pathetic in comparison to how hard it is to obtain and max enchants on a mace. I fail to see why anyone would use breach at all with these new base stats and the enchantment exclusivity. The mace in its current state is just another novelty weapon that everyone is going to shelve after 5 minutes like most did with their crossbow, when it should feel like a valued addition to your existing arsenal like a trident. It should feel like a powerful artifact that the builders of the trial chambers had to dismantle and seal away until someone worthy of it came along, but right now it feels extremely weak, clunky, underpowered, and most importantly, unfun to use. I feel like the main thing I was excited for this update has been nerfed into the ground and ruined.</p>",

Using Wind Burst for chain attacks made the Mace very fun to use! Please bring this back. I know people wanted the Mace to be nerfed but it’s too nerfed now, especially for its rarity, and we need a middle ground. Thank you for reading and receiving our feedback as always</p>",

Also, wind burst should be made to work if you land a critical hit, instead of falling five blocks.</p>\n<p>I think the mace got nerfed too much, it isn't powerful enough to use in pvp anymore because of the enchantments being incompatible and doing too little damage.

        "body": "<p>This is all around a really bad idea, and I almost thought it wasn't real until I saw all the comments in here of people talking like children. First off, removing the obfuscation map. While it would make things more difficult for people attempting to modify the game, it will have nowhere near the same impact as removing the pdb file. It may make things slightly more difficult, but it's by no means impossible. This is actually a quirk of the Java language. Basically, most languages will compile your code into something a machine can read and execute. Java however, compiles your code into byte-code which is close to but not quite machine readable code. When you run a Java application, Java actually compiles this byte-code down to machine code at runtime. This has the benefit that you can run Java apps on any machine that can run Java instead of needing a different compilation for each piece of hardware. If it works on Windows, it'll work on Mac or Linux with no extra steps. Native-Image would only do so much to combat this. It is not a perfect solution at all, and would create more work for the developers as they'd need to compile a different version of Minecraft for each operating system. DRM is a bad suggestion in any circumstance too. Ironically, this would make the situation worse because mod developers would be overburdened with no incentive to keep working, while cheat developers would continue to have a very clear financial incentive. Please reconsider your feedback.</p>",
