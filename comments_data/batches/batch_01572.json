Horseshoe can be enchanted like armor. Could add two more rare enchantments like “achilles heel I-III” allowing player or horse breif levitation on jump(has to jump twice for activation &amp; can only be found in Ancient ruins, Strongholds, &amp; End Dimension), and “ram charge I-II” allowing player or horse the ability to run into enemies doing slight damage and knockback(should usually have a chance of finding at pillager outpost).

But hear are some other suggestions to make them more interesting.</p>\n<p>• Young Rhino beetles would gather in large numbers in the full moon to moult, which is their most vulnerable time, with only 4 hearts and no armour. They are also unable to move much when doing this, and after they have completed moulting, they would become a fully fledged adult and would drop their hide, which could be used in several potions.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>• They would actively eat mushrooms, which help them to heal and grow faster. You may even feed them mushrooms to gain their trust, which would make them more passive towards you and would also help you attack hostile mobs (except creepers and phantoms).</p>\n<p>• Adult Rhino beetles are territorial, and would mark their territory by stripping wood. In the new moon, adults would compete with each other for territory by bashing into them and hurling them out, using the point system to see who wins. Hurling- 2 points per block, &nbsp;bashing- 1 point per block. Battles are rarely fatal.</p>\n<p>•Rhino beetles have unique strength stats, with some able to deal more damage and hurl even further, and in rare cases, are even able to fly for short distances.</p>\n<p>As you can see, Rhino beetle behaviour is very tied to the moon cycle, which would help boost the usefulness of it.</p>",
