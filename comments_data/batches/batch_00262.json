It should have larger radius than sculk sensors to be able to reach other sensors that are farther away from the interpreted location of where the first sensors recieve vibrations. The sculk spore (calling it that for now) has connected intertwined roots with the sensors, as of plant life does. </p>\n\n<p>With this it will display slight movement and a different tune than the sensors and displays that It is sending a message signal towards farther sensors or sensors that have not received a signal to be made aware. Carrying out the vibrational message.</p>\n\n<p>I like this because It will broaden the horizons for wireless redstone and be made more exciting yet fun to innovate and with. I really do find this a great idea, and If anyone else thinks so please vote and comment on what you think or what additional ideas there should be to this.</p>",
