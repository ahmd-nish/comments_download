Since soul fire is a lower light source (10 vs 15) I think we should either set a copper green fire to be the same (10) or to have a lower light level (5 or 8). Generally, I like the idea of having a green copper fire allow for mob spawns while also lighting up an area, this could be used to give a super creepy vibe to the already generating mob spawner dungeons, lighting up the ceiling / room with a green hue while also allowing / continuing mob spawns coming out from the dungeon. of course this would carry over to all the green copper fire light sources (campfire, tourch, lantern).</p>\n<p>No idea if it'd be better to use a copper block ( either all copper block variants or a limited select) for this crafting recipe or to simplify it to be a copper ingot or a copper nugget (which currently doesn't exist). Either way I would absolutely love to see a green copper-based fire added to the game; maybe adding it could open the door to the end receiving a block for a purple fire.</p>",
