I just think that the echo shard would work in this blocks crafting recipe better. For one Lore Wise the Echo shard has tracking properties as seen in the echo compass, and it would make sense as since the other component in this crafting recipe The skulk sensor is also from ancient cities maybe calibrated skulk sensors could be built into the ancient cities structure somehow. Another reason is as a hard-core player myself the echo shard currently has no real use if playing in Hardcore, so this crafting recipe change could give some much-needed used to this item, and a reason for us to go to the ancient city in general. . as I said, in the beginning, I do not think that amethyst should not get a new crafting recipe or use. I think this would just work better for the echo shard, but I would also like to see amethyst being used somehow in 1.20 but I would like to see what you and others think about this. Thank you. PS sorry about the typos.</p>",

A lectern, comparator, and two wool take up half of that range. Might want to make it mono directional to help with TPS overhead?)</li>\n<li>The cooldown does limit the usefulness, but I don't know if this should actually change.

Then I thought, how cool would it be if these two items can somehow be used together to make some sort of item that can teleport the player from one teleporter to another? I know that may seem way too over powered at first, but the crafting recipe for the block could be very difficulty to complete. When you think of the warden, he seems to just appear out of no where and is almost unkillable until you have very good enchanted gear. Maybe make the warden’s health just a tad bit larger so he is harder to kill, and have him drop some sort of item like the heart of the warden or something like that. Then maybe make the next item, you need a skulk sensor, crying obsidian, and ender pearls; just a few ideas not too sure but just some items that go along well with that deep dark and skulk theme. I don’t know there’s just a lot of cool things you can do with em</p>",

The biggest reason for this being it is very impractical to code all the possible frequencies you may want the sensor to pick up using redstone, and more of it is only possible through player activity.</p>\n<p>However, we already have a block in the game which can be easily tuned and activated to give multiple outputs that the sensor could pick up: Note Blocks. I think either by corresponding the 15 different frequencies to a pitch the note block produces, or perhaps instead an instrument type, this would be a much easier and more practical way to make use of the calibrated skulk sensor's ability to detect and transfer different frequencies.<br><br>Additionally, it'd also be more practical for relaying the frequency over a long distance if perhaps the calibrated sensors had a greater range than the default sensors. Or instead amethyst blocks can pick up resonated frequencies from a greater ranger than normal.</p>\n<p>But overall I believe these two changes would greatly enhance the practical use of the calibrated skulk sensor.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I think a system where the player could choose one specific vibration type would be better, and the way to calibrate it would be similar to locking repeaters. When the sensor does not receive a Redstone input, it will detect any vibrations, and its cool down would be longer. If a redstone input is applied to the sensor while it is on cooldown from a specific vibration, that vibration becomes locked until the Redstone input turns off. While the sensor is locked, the cool down is much shorter, and it can only detect the specific locked vibration, and no other sound would be detected.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this would make the calibrated skulk sensor much more user friendly and much more adaptive in Redstone. Also, providing context for how to use this method in the ancient city room is also a great idea that many others have also commented. Thanks for listening to my rant!</p>",

Also, there should be some thing that goes in the water like maybe the raft that is part of the new bamboo wood that could actually be the size of two boats combined and take more resources to craft. Maybe it could be used to transport larger animals. With horses having their breed mechanics fixed to where you can actually breed with some predictability, there will be people who want to breed and trade horses over a distance!</p>",

I hope this function gets brought back because it feels like horses have no purpose anymore. Why bother exploring with your horse if you’re just going to have to leave it behind at some point? Maybe the elytra makes traversing bodies of water easier but its more of a late game item and most exploration, for me, happens when i just start the game. Either way horses in boats still has a function because donkeys add extra inventory space you wouldn’t get if you were just flying around in your elytra. Clearly horses in boats has a place in minecraft gameplay and needs to be brought back, any of the suggestions in this thread would work because the bottom line is it adds to the game, in a big way, instead of taking away from it</p>",

However similar to a real life spear all attacks to a target 1-2 blocks from the player could do dramatically less damage. Or even none! To remedy this a spear could have a extra block or so of reach that (if you really want something like a crit) could deal extra damage if a target is within that range.</p>\n<p>Your idea is great, I just want to distinguish it further (and sorry for makeing my comment longer than your post).</p>\n<p>I think this idea truly shines&nbsp; if you want a new play style based on movement, agility and distance. It must be said that if you make a new post or edit this one with these ideas in mind that it might be a better fit in the experimental combat update. As a side note the bamboo spear (could) have entirely unique enchantments too like; an increase in range on the aforementioned \"sweet spot\" (that i never called a sweet spot) or a deflect enchantment (in that 1-2 block range there would be a % chance that you could block a % of damage based off of the strength of the enchantment).</p>\n<p>amount defended could be 100% or scale 15-75% through levels 1-5 for example.</p>\n<p>while block chance I think would fit best on a 1-3 scale (e.g. 20-60%) so you can feel the difference.

Obviously the Trail Ruins are in very early development, but so far while it's a cool structure to theorise about, in the end it's not much more than a series of small caves with not much interest/content. These structures could be what the Trail Ruins needs to set itself apart from other structures.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Cons. of this idea:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If they are going to stay at a similar size as to what they are now, then there won't be a whole lot of space for the little introductions. Of course, this can probably be fixed by simply making them have larger floor space, but this might take away from the original point of the structure.</li>\n<li>The blocks that are required for teaching the players how to do these things might not line up with the current colour scheme.</li>\n<li>The players that are finding and excavating the Trail Ruins might already be at a player skill level where they possibly don't even need to be shown how to make these things (a counter-argument could be made by simply pointing to the redstone in the ancient cities).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, a cool suggestion to look into!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

That would be a really overpowered find early game, when the player is most likely to first stumble across this surface level structure. As such, this would also have to be relegated to a different structure, probably something challenging, somewhere in the negative y levels.</p>\n<p>I do like the general idea of adding broken statues to the trail ruins though.

And it periodically takes \"naps\" but a way to move inventories automatically without tons of hoppers, rails, or having to lead a llama donkey team.
