Iron should also conduct heat like copper albeit to a much lesser extent. Different materials should have different pressure limits before experiencing block displacement along a weak link. Excessive pressure build-up breaking a weak link should result in depending on the pressure at worst the displaced blocks being launched a short distance and hot burning steam shooting out like a jet until the pressure decreases. A steam mechanic like this would be amazing.</p>",
