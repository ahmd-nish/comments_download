Examples in game include, no hypothermia damage/death, no hyperthermia death/damage, no convective or radiant heat burning death/damage (like howdin hand bove fire) no dehydration death/damage.</p>\n<p>Pweese, take da laws uh physics and limits uh da body into account.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
