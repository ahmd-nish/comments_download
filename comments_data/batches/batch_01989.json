Examples of this being done well are all the plank variants, ore variants, and log variants (all within the uppermost section of the \"Building Blocks\" tab) are kept together and organized. This makes it easier to find that one ore block you need: just look for the section with a bunch of ores! Some times when this isn't used well, are glass and tinted glass, ice variants, and off-shot blocks such as bookshelves, emerald blocks, and lapis blocks. Each of these examples are strewn across the \"Building Blocks\" tab, with no semblance of organization other than the version they were added in (if that). Having all variants of ice within a group would be more organized, as well as placing the regular glass and tinted glass along side the colored glass variants. Bookshelves could be placed alongside other naturally-generated-structures blocks in the \"Decoration Blocks\" tab, as well as the emerald blocks and lapis blocks being placed alongside the other solid ore blocks such as iron, gold, and diamond.</p>\n<p>Again, I've run out of room for more suggestions but will continue later with another comment on this post</p>",
