You can also combine an elytra with the chestplate and the durability will go up by 450. Next, is Star-gaia amor, much like star-tempest armor, instead of gaining hearts, you can luck levels, and the full set equipped grants resistance 3. Finally, there is Star- Aqua armor (not mentioned above but included.) which, much like the others, I know, grants 1 level of respiration per piece equipped, and with the full set grants water breathing for 4 minutes. They can all be crafted, using a water bucket, slimeballs, phantom membrane and starlit ingot. The last thing I'd like to mention is what I call the&nbsp;<strong>Star Summon Crystal</strong>, which allows you to change the weather, using stardust each use. (5 minute server cooldown) This can be placed, and has a light level of 9, and grants all users within a 50 block area infinite night vision, and when used grants one level of luck.

        "body": "<p>I almost forgot to mention an axolotyl drop, with 0.25% drop chance, is Zues' Lightning bolt (5 types), Puny, Weak, Modern, Strong, and World. Each one has a base of 10 damage, and each higher level has +5 damage. They can also be upgraded in the Forge, and channeling always summons lightning, no matter the weather. Mending can NOT be put on these, but unbreaking 3 - 4 can (Greater Upgrade Table)<br>and a new enchantment, called Striking 1 - 3, can summon 1 - 3 extra bolts of lighting (only works with channeling), along with Summoning 1 - 2, which has a 0.17% - 0.5% chance of activation, which will summon a ravager to fight for you. (can summon other mobs, but ravager has a higher chance by 0.02%.) Summoning will also turn the bolt purple, blue, teal, or green. (green being a better mob, purple being worse.) These bolts can also create an Infinite Power storm, when placed in a Star Summon Crystal, it can be activated using 25 stardust and creates a swirling vortex, and lightning strikes the crystal each time (every 1 - 6 seconds) and causes it to rain &amp; snow within a 175 block radius. (the lower the tear, it decreases by 25 blocks, World being 175.)</p>",
