In the implementation they create an asymptotic limit to how good a horse you can breed that means the better the more likely a much worse offspring. So you are better off just finding random horses than you are trying to breed good ones.<br><br>Even worse, the Minecraft implementation isn't fun. It's tedious and frustrating. This isn't good gaming math. <br><br>I don't think it needs to be as complicated as proposed. Simply having a chance for each stat to always improve or degrade would do it. I think what the intention was, was to have children generally inherit from the parent with a chance to get better or worse but they mangled it. <br><br>Say you have a stat that is a float between 0.0-1.0 where 1.0 is the best stat and zero is the worst.<br>p1 is this stat for parent 1. p2 is the stat for parent 2. p3 would be the child stat. R is a pseudorandom value between 0.0 and 1.0.<br><br>p3 = min( max( absolute( p1-p2)/2 + 1.1*(R-0.5)*(p1-p2), 0.0), 0.0, 1.0);<br><br>What you end up with (if I haven't mangled it) is an even probability centered on creating offspring that is the average of it's parents. i.e. R will have an average value of .5 which will turn the second part of the equation to zero on average. But there is also a chance for a plus or minus 10%.</p>",
