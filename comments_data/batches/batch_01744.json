That said, a fully separate wire system might add a lot of complexity and further split redstone mechanics between platforms.</p>\n<p>Building on this idea, oxidation could directly affect copper wiring’s signal strength and range. Fresh copper would carry signals farther, while more oxidized stages would gradually reduce the maximum range. Waxing could lock in the desired behavior. <br>Copper wiring could also have a longer maximum range than redstone dust (for example 30–45 blocks), making it useful for long-distance or compact builds without replacing redstone entirely.</p>\n<p>A possible trade-off could be crafting copper wiring using both copper and redstone (for example, 8 copper ingots/block + 1 redstone dust/block). This would keep redstone dust relevant while making copper wiring a more expensive, advanced option for compact or wall/ceiling signal routing. <br>That way it’s an upgrade path rather than a replacement for redstone.</p>",
