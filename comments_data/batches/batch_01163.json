Vibrant visuals should be compatible with low-end devices so that more players can access and enjoy the game regardless of their hardware. 2. Supporting low-end devices allows the game to reach a bigger audience, which helps build a stronger player base. 3. Players on weaker devices deserve the same level of immersion as those on high-end devices, and optimized vibrant visuals make the experience fairer. 4. Immersion does not always require heavy graphics; with proper optimization, vibrant colors and visuals can run smoothly even on low-end hardware. 5. Ensuring that vibrant visuals work across all devices gives the game a positive reputation, since players feel included and valued. 6. Appealing visuals that remain smooth on low-end devices encourage players to stay engaged and play for longer periods. 7. By making vibrant visuals compatible with weaker hardware, the game becomes more future-proof, since not everyone upgrades to newer devices quickly.</p>",
