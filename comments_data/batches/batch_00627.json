        "body": "<p>Milk buckets don’t really make that much sense in Minecraft. Where other posts aim to add milk bottles to coexist with milk buckets, I propose swapping out the milk bucket entirely.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the inventory sprite, a bucket of milk clearly holds one cubic meter of milk (based on other bucket types such as water or powdered snow). Converting, this is 1000 Liters (or over 264 gallons) of milk in a single bucket. Minecraft obviously doesn’t have to be realistic, but just for reference, the average dairy cow produces about 20-25 Liters (or 6-7 gallons) daily. Based on the crafting recipe of cake, it would require 3000 Liters of milk (or nearly 800 gallons) of milk to craft a single cake using three milk buckets. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, to remove potion effects, a player has to consume that entire 1000 Liter bucket. A player cannot consume from any other bucket type, and you also can’t place milk on the ground as you can with every other bucket type. </p>\n\n<p>The solution would be to simply replace the milk bucket with milk bottles. This makes the amount of milk used in crafting recipes more sensible, and it would align more closely with how other “drinkables” operate in game. It would also solve the inconsistency that milk has with other bucket types. Nothing would change aside from using an empty bottle on a cow instead of a bucket.</p>\n\n<p>By using bottles, too, this could enable future possibilities of splash bottles of milk which can be used in combat or as a way to save pets from harmful effects.</p>",
