Maybe the Warden could also be able to swim in water, but that doesn't really make sense, and also, there isn't much water in the Deep Dark anyway. Also, its roar that was previously showcased in Minecraft Live last year should be able to knock players off ledges, to prevent them from escaping without killing the Warden. And finally, it would also be good if it could be immune to Arrows, since then you can't kill it from afar. Maybe it could also break blocks too, so you couldn't hide away behind some blocks with a hole to attack it with a sword through.</p>\n<p>Edit: Now that I know that it seems that there will be water in the Deep Dark, maybe the Warden should still sink in water but have an extended reach, so it can still kill you from down there.</p>",
