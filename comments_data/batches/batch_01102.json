And maps don't do much to help either as it's only a set amount of space, and not a map of the \"whole\" world. So, I think regular maps in Minecraft should be used for decoration, and the minimap used for navigation. Or maybe you can craft a minimap, put it in your inventory, and then a minimap will appear in the corner of the screen until it's not in your inventory anymore? Most open world games (Terraria or BOTW for example) have minimaps so you don't get lost so easily, it's annoying having to screenshot places, and then trying to find the exact coordinates for places. </p>",
