I have always disliked the way that call of duty manages bans due to this and I hope that it never comes to this game. You said, \"For those that have bought subscriptions directly from MOJANG (where login is required to cancel subscription), cancellation of subscription should only be possible by writing a signed snail-mail letter to a specific address, where you request the subscription to be cancelled.\" so what about the users that do not understand that they have to cancel their subscription after their account is terminated? What if they don't have the ability to send mail to the address? It honestly sounds that you want people to have as hard of a time as they can, which will drive many away from this game.</p>",
