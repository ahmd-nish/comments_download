Here are a few ideas for limitations you could have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order to shoot, it has to be fully powered. (Red stone block right next to it, no red stone dust or powered opaque blocks)</li>\n<li>Powered up with special eyes of enter (maybe crafted with nether star?) that get worn down with durability</li>\n<li>Entity being shot from cannon only travels certain distance</li>\n<li>Reload speed between red stone signals</li>\n<li>Must be activated by a player (right clicked)</li>\n<li>Redstone pulse must be longer than one tick (observer proof)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can use one or more for its limitations. The End’s world border is easier to reach than most other world borders. Setting up a simple rideable flying machine can get you there in a few hours. Infinite power can get boring. A real challenge keeps new players hooked and creative.</p>\n<p>I hope you have a nice day!</p>\n<p>-BD103</p>",

Each eye of ender provides would provide 16 shoots, and a total of 4 eyes of ender could fit inside it.</p>\n<p>Each shoot has a cooldown of three seconds and depending on the level of the redstone signal the shoot could be more or less powerfull&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To make it challenging to the player to the player to reach this end ruins a new mob could appear in this dimension to make travelling more dangerous.

However, some kind of \"wither water\" could be cool.</li>\n<li>I made my own <a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360048099991-Wither-Alter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wither Alter</a> suggestion a while ago. In my opinion, wither alters should be required for spawning the wither, as that creates an environment for fighting it and adds some novelty to the experience.
