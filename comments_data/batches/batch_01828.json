If you were to come across a rift for either of these places, your just going to be able to skip a HUGE part of the game. Think about it. It wouldn't be so bad for the Nether, as players can just build the portals and go in and out at will, but the End one is the one I have the most problems with. If a player were to come across an End rift,they could just skip huge and major parts of the game. The End is a end-game area. It's designed to be tough and you NEED to have good armor to survive. If a player who has just started up a world comes across one of these, they won't just be able to get into the end way quicker than players should. They will be completely destroyed by the Ender Dragon because of how tough he is. If this idea was to be anywhere near balanced enough, these rifts would have to be EXTREMELY rare. The Nether one wouldn't have to be as rare, as people can get there quite easily with a bit of luck, but an End rift would have to be much harder to find, as players could just skip past most of the game.</p>",

All four of these parts could then be crafted together to get a finished ballista. Why is it in parts? Each part could have variants that affect the finished ballista. EX: the base. A wood base might not hold as well as an iron base. A stationary pedestal isn’t able to move, but one that spins could. The frame of the ballista could be modified to include more power, or special effects, such as, holding a torch to light arrows. Great idea!!</p>",

The damage could be higher to make it more an anti-tank role to deal with mobs like ravagers, iron golems, withers, and the ender dragon easier. With the given drawback that a ballista is a stationary target with little to no cover. If more nerfs were necessary, have a fixed rotation radius or simply make the recipe more expensive.
