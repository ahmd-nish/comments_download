The catching mechanic strikes me as unnecessary since I'm also not a fan of the ability to tame every single peaceful mob in the game, so I'd be fine if the bugs stayed as particle effects. The fireflies are a great idea on their own and I think should be in nearly every biome at night. They would add a lot to their atmosphere!</p>",

This isn't just needed as something that would make gameplay better, like making bigger and better caverns, dungeons and mobs, it's actually HARMFUL to allow the nether roof to exist under the building limit.</p>\n<p>Now let me make it clear, I'm happy with the roofs FORM as is, a thin layer of bedrock. Making it thicker wouldn't hurt, but that's not my concern. The big empty space existing over the roof, where you can build whatever you want to needs removal.</p>\n<p>It was never designed like this, the nether was always supposed to reach up to the limit, it was never fixed when the build height was increased from 128.</p>\n<p>It's a genuine travel exploit that has no excuse to exist. 1 block in the nether is worth 8 blocks in the overworld, so traveling through the nether can be used as a shortcut. I think that's totally reasonable, because the danger of being in the nether is the exchange. If you're allowed to just get up onto the roof with 0 effort, and make a portal to your destination, that exchange loses balance, and the player is free to use what is effectively a speed hack while holding W.</p>\n<p>With the nether roof raised, players can actually play the game in order to achieve their travel perk, by making a highway through the caverns and new biomes, or risking elytra flying over lava and dodging ghasts.

Mojang made the effort to have the biomes generate with unique height yet this is exclusive to a dimension with half the height of the overworld? I think using the overworlds build limit (256) would better highlight these height based biomes, and really make the nether feel like some huge cavernous expansion. I have always seen the 128 bedrock level of the nether as more of an artefact of the old build hight and not just a feature. Now I have played around with a few mods that make the nether a true 256 height, and oh boy is it laggy! so if performance is improving substantially with 1.16 I think even the world generation time would not be much of an issue.<br><br>Also, a note because this would break worlds, new chunks would generate and leave this kind of cutaway section where new terrain opens up onto the old nether roof. This kind of issue has really always been an issue for old worlds where new biomes or world gen made fur cross-section world gen and really does not harm the game. Technically you could \"repair\" an old-world nether by using the same seeds higher terrain and copying it above the bedrock of the older world using structure blocks if it really bugged you that much.<br><br>And another note since yes, travel above bedrock would still be a major exploit that simply raising the nether does not fix. Why not just add void damage above nether bedrock? Some servers already have plugins to stop people from using it as a free travel method so I think void damage above bedrock is a no brainer solution to that one.</p>",

Worlds getting the \"newly loaded\" tag will immediately give all current chunks a \"pre1.16 \" tag.

This blocks off old Nether roofs.</p>\n<p>Also, in chunks with the \"pre1.16 \" tag, player will get void damage at y 128 and above.

I feel like the Nether and End should not only have a 256-block tall height, but with that just integrating the 1.18 generation into the other dimensions. I think the actual Nether should be 256 blocks tall with included revamped generation, and the Nether Roof still stays the same so everyone can keep their Nether farms, with the dimension height going from y319 to y-64. Same with the End dimension though, because not only the dimension itself is barren, it also is a flat landscape with nothing that special about it. If Mojang doesn't add this in, maybe someone could make a data pack or mod about this idea, but this has bothered me for a while.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I personally do a lot of large projects and often need a large amount of resources. Recently, I made something that could be considered a megabuild over the span of a month. Say If I wanted quartz pillars and walls for the interior I would spend probably 10x more time mining than building. This is how large projects just go unfinished unless it is possible to build a very efficient gold farm over the nether roof and barter for some quartz. Obviously that can't happen because you can't build over the nether roof. The 2 things you can do is either build a crappy gold farm or spawn proofing everything near. It just doesn't make sense to have such big difference between bedrock and java which place such limits on bedrock players. For example: Quasi-connectivity, TNT duping, one tick pulse pistons, underwater door breathing, extra delay in redstone, no odd timings, and no update order. My point is there is already ENOUGH limitation placed on bedrock players, the other practical problems can mostly be solved with intuitive engineering, but no amount of building and redstone unless with effort comparable to or greater than a FULL TIME minecraft player. The other problems may need the entire game code to be changed as they operate based on the game clock or other fundamental components that many other things in the game rely on. However, the build Height of the nether does not affect anything else in the game. This change can be easily implemented in a new update.&nbsp; &nbsp;(pt 2 in comment)</p>",

However, with current terrain generation, building these farms inside the terrain (i.e. under the nether roof) is impractical until the very late game (when the very technical players start building nether perimeters).<br>Thus most players just build on top of the nether roof, thereby getting entirely around any spawnproofing required.<br>It is this TOO easy to build very powerful farms very early in the game, making the entire process something to be got over with quickly, rather than an engaging part of gameplay.</p>",

They would be much larger than a regular village, and slightly more advanced. The area around the biome would have a higher chance of generating regular villages than other areas nearby.I</p>\n<p><strong>Where they would generate</strong></p>\n<p>Colonies would generate inside plains biomes, especially ones that are near the ocean. They would also generate on rivers.</p>\n<p><strong>What they would look like</strong></p>\n<p>Colonies would use the familiar cobblestone and oak as materials along with more advanced ones like birch wood and brick.Streets would be cobblestone instead of gravel. There would be a blacksmith, church , houses and all the other buildings seen in villages, but with elements of these new materials in their design. There would also be 2 new structures.</p>\n<p><strong>Rowhouses</strong></p>\n<p>Long rectangular structures with multiple houses, with a brick foundation and cobblestone walls.</p>\n<p><strong>Towers</strong></p>\n<p>Buildings generally only generated twice in colonies,in the center, ranging from 3 floors to 6 floors.

Of course, I think it would be made differently then the original mod, as sad as it is to say, it's theme and atmosphere is very outdated compared to Minecraft's current style. I want to see it added but I also don't think doing the same ol' thing would be very beneficial, let alone well paced or challenging, giving it a revamp like taking out things that might be copywrite (I know the creator works for mojang, just the stuff that might cause issues), or redoing the textures, making things more aligned with the current version, along with making it harder to get the Aether, other then just growstone and water (maybe a deep dark item? Go to the deepest, darkest place to gain access to the highest and brightest?).&nbsp;<br>Just some food for thought, though if this never happens I'll still be satisfied with Minecraft, the games history could've gone a lot of different ways, I'm glad that it happened the way that it did. :)<br><br>Side note: A lot of the ideas in the Aether were very original and I think that's what a lot of people enjoyed about it, like the floaty bunnies and the sky whales(i think these are original, don't take my word for that, I didn't do any research on it XD)</p>",

I think it would be a better idea to add the Biome for the End instead. These Shores could be islands made of darker blocks like the new Blackstone, obsidian, and maybe some new blocks. (Open for ideas) The islands would be more frequent than the current ones, at closer range of each other, and at different heights making flying through the area a bit more difficult. The islands could have pools of water that fall onto underlying islands. Endermen would not spawn here due to the water and would help filter areas where certain mobs spawn for farms. You could add a new source of lighting like glowing crystals for these dark islands or another form of lighting. This could provide opportunity for a new mob to inhabit the islands here. Something to occupy the pools or inhabit the obsidian fields here. For example, a mob that stays at the center of the pool and range attacks players that come close with a splash effect or some other type of mob.</span></p>",

Just like haw many biomes spawn a certain kind of tree, like the dark oak forest has dark oak, and how the jungle has jungle wood, the swamp should also have a respective wood type, like possibly, \"Swamp wood\". This wood could sorta have a dark bark with a kind of a murky dark green in it, also the leaves would be similar to it.</p>\n<p>Another feature could include mobs that are also exclusive to the swamp. Again, how other biomes have their own mobs- like strays, polar bears, husks, etc.- the swamp should also have a special mob. For example, their could be a mob- the&nbsp;<em>\"Lurker\"</em>- that stays near water a wanders slowly, even though it prefers the water because going on land in daylight would mean that it would catch fire, it can go on land other wise. This would also be an \"undead\" monster.</p>\n<p>What I think would be better for the swamp is if it had more blocks and mobs that really make the swamp special. Basically it should just be more elaborate, like some of the other biomes.</p>\n<p>A more simpler idea is that there should be different variants of the swamp, like possibly \" swampy forest\", you get the idea.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

They will drop some feathers when killed. They will be partially in 1 block high water but they can go on land. There will be a baby which will just float in the water and unlike most mobs, it will just stay flat on the surface when swimming instead of bobbing up and down constantly.</p>\n<p>Crocodiles/Alligators: They will be a little less than 1 block tall, and will be 3-5 blocks long, depending on age (babies will be 3 and adults will be 5). The babies will be neutral, and the adults will be hostile when a player is in range. They will sometimes attack by staying still and waiting for its victim to enter the water. They will occasionally come on land for a while.</p>\n<p>Flowered Lilypads: When placing lilypads, there will be a 70% chance of it to spawn with a small flower on it. When destroyed, it will drop the lilypad and a lotus flower. The flower can then be placed on other lilypads.</p>\n<p>Expanded Swamps: Bodies of water in swamps aren't really big. They should be expanded to have a large radius of a bout 60, if not, more.</p>\n<p>Mangrove Trees: A new type of wood which exclusively grows in the swamps. It's bark will be like acacia but more light gray-ish. The planks will be something between jungle and acacia. It will obviously come in stairs, slabs, fences, doors, striped wood, etc. They will mostly generate partially submerged by the swamp water, and will be mostly 2x2, though it can come in 1 block forms too.</p>\n<p>Sea Otters: They will be cute little animals that will come in groups, mostly swimming by the surface. They will play with floating items just like dolphins, but when a player comes within a radius of lets say, 10 blocks, they will swim away like in real life. They can come on land but they prefer staying in the water.</p>\n<p>I made a post about this, so vote it and comment about it for more ideas.</p>\n<p><em>(link to duplicate post removed, if the ideas are here they don't need a new thread ~nb)</em></p>",

This would help you find a swamp ruin because you could find without it but it's harder. A swamp ruin would be like a dungeon. It would contain traps like from a jungle temple and mob spawners from strongholds. It would be made of lots of mossy stone and mossy cobblestone bog monsters would have a better chance to spawn ,but it can not drop a swamp ruin map if it spawns in the swamp ruins the loot of the ruin would be emeralds ,diamonds ,and maybe swamp crystal. I think the swamp crystal would be the only thing I don't think will make it if you even think about adding this. The swamp crystal would give you immunity to bog monsters ,witches ,and slimes. It would also give you infinite regeneration (witch) ,jump boost (slimes) ,and any mob that hits you will get poison. The swamp crystal only works in the swamp. Well I'm done finally. I don't know what i'll post next maybe willow trees.</p>",

Just like haw many biomes spawn a certain kind of tree, like the dark oak forest has dark oak, and how the jungle has jungle wood, the swamp should also have a respective wood type, like possibly, \"Swamp wood\". This wood could sorta have a dark bark with a kind of a murky dark green in it, also the leaves would be similar to it.</em></p>\n<p>In addition to this, it would be cool to see the swamp have petrified logs with the same texture as Novak’s idea of the “Swamp wood”. I think it would fit in well, and make sense mainly because as of the unexplained appearance of the “Petrified Wood” (old type of oak slab that acted as a stone slab)&nbsp;on the Java version. This idea would make sense for newer players who don’t understand why petrified wood is a thing in the game, and make petrified wood obtainable.</p>",

There are lots of fascinating glacier caves in many regions of the world, frequently occuring in mountains like Mt. Rainer in Washignton, and in other semi-snowy areas like Switzerland. They also occur mostly throughout glaciers in the arctic/tundras. I think they should occur as independent cave biomes that in order to generate must intersect with/go through a mountain, tundra or snowy taiga biome. When you look at images of glacier caves and mountains, you can see them forming as relatively narrow and low tunnels, eventually curving expanding into more medium caves. That means its generation could be close to some of the tunnels we saw at Mincraft Live, and also similar to some of the Lush Cave footage that was shared on Twitter (a \"medium\" sized cave). These glacier cave are characterized by the blue color and interesting patterns the ice makes, which could be perfectly represented using blue ice. Some ice pillars also form occasionally when the cave is big enough. Pointed ice could also be seen on the ceilings in real glacier caves, but I think this would be too similar to Pointed Dripstone. Finally, as some people suggested, I think Powdered Snow and normal snow would really tie in that cave with other features and add more danger/challenge to it, maybe even Strays as well.</p>",

The ice and fire caves could have other dangers like an open nether portal leading right to a bastion remnant or nether fortress for the fire or lava caves and for the ice caves to lead to an ice fortress which is located below the ice caves. the attacks for the three different dragons all have different ranged attacks; fire breath, ice breath, and a combination of the two.

You could also retexture the amethyst crystal to be ice-like I think this would be so beautiful! Maybe diamonds would spawn there more often? Idk but please! 😩 I wish this post had more votes! </p>",

It could also be challenging adding the freeze effect if u stay in for long enough without leather armor. Also I think I'd be great if while climbing the new mountains u could fall thru the new powdered snow into theese ice cavers, it would make it challenging and a cool way to find the caves. Same way the lush caves use the azalea tree this could use the powdered snow to indicate a ice cavern bellow. </p>",

There should be moonstone for the ground, with magical properties (I don't know what though). You should be able to see the earth in the sky, with the sun behind it. :) There should be some stuff on the moon though, some kind of generated structure with epic loot and lore implications.

The chameleons will stick they're toungs to eat some tropical insectsand change color . And the anaconda could coil up mobs like pigs and the player and tighten, suffocating them. Tropical birds may include toucans, flamingos and a new tropical birds mob. Parrots would also spawn too. The insects could have cicadas, Hercules beetles, mantis, mosquitos, and butterflies. Cicadas will make loud noises the Hercules beetles will pinch when you get too close. The mantis will chill near the flowers and attack when you get too close to its flower. And the butterflies will come in different colours and patterns and will be cool. Crabs and Hermit crabs could spawn too. Maybe as well some rays could be spotted swimming around. Shells will be found and can be traded to collectors in a local village. Slothe will be a cute addition barley moving and laying onot tree branches. This has been a very long post but I have one more thing to add. Tiki and blow darts. The tiki people are an aggressive tribe with hunters that roam the night. The only way to sneak in there stilted huts is to put on a tiki mask and blend in. They have valuable treasures to collect so take the challer get if you dare. They attack with blow darts. Wich are like bows but the fire instantly but take a few seconds to recharge. That is everything I have to share for this comment and I hope this gets added.</p>",

As for palm trees, I created some on my single player that works nicely but I think you guys can do better. I used stripped birch tiered at an angle and then made \"fronds\" by tiering birch leaves like a palm tree. It would be cool if a tree could just grow like that instead of me spending a good 30mins making one. For authenticity mix in some jungle trees and parrots. Maybe add some orchids to grow on these islands besides in the swamps, maybe different colored orchids? Turtles and dolphins for sure. Chickens and pigs. (no horses or cows unless its a big island) The islander villagers can be the swamp villagers but re-colored/textured for example the leaf on their head could be a big flower instead. Make it cute for sure. I think this would be an awesome biome to include.&nbsp;</p>",

Ghosts may spawn here and spook the player, giving them blindness. Ghosts drop ectoplasm, which can be crafted together with common building blocks like planks, cobblestones, and bricks to create variations of those blocks (called \"Phase (Block)\") that appear normal but you can walk through. Can also be brewed to create a Potion of Phase Vision, which puts a white outline around Phase Blocks so that they aren't impossible to identify and to avoid traps.</li>\n</ul>",

When broken, they will drop 2 coconut slices, which can be cooked into Baked Coconut and eaten, or if not cooked, can be drank from (because coconut milk exists) to remove all potions effect like cow milk does. Some people enjoy playing the game in a way where they don't use animal products, so this would be a fun little touch to add (mildly related: PLEASE let us smelt rotten flesh into leather!). Coconut slices can be crafted back into full coconuts by placing 2 in a crafting grid, because they'd presumably have good potential for builders. It'd be funny if you could create a coconut helmet from coconut slices, but that'd be a rather obsolete feature unless it came with something special like the the ability to resist damage from heavy falling objects (stalactites and anvils). Coconuts can be harvested with silk touch to avoid the process of harvesting and recrafting them.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all of these things would be added. Just potential ideas.</p>",

The only reason I would love to see this is because the Sniffers can only sniff out a couple of seeds and there are only a handful of crops.

They are not killed in sunlight, rather they lose their ability to fly and move quickly. If you manage to lead one up, it will function as a slow-falling potion until the lead breaks. If you encounter them while they are awake they will swoop at you like a phantom, (although they only stay about 1 or 2 blocks above your head) and whenever they bite you they restore some health. When killed they drop an oakmoth wing which can either be used to repair your elytra or combined with a regeneration potion to make a Potion of Hematophagy: the potion of hematophagy would allow you to gain health whenever you deal damage. The better your weapon the faster you heal.

And I think the bushes could be bigger and smaller not just 3x2x3 and get rid of that entire part about the rewards because you could find something like spikes/needles which can be used to make spiked arrows which travel slower and more drop but hit harder. those are some needed improvements to this in my opinion.</p>",

In terms of new mobs it would be nice for minecraft to release a cow with Chorus, this cow does not reproduce with hay but with Chorus, I know this looks a lot like modded minecraft, but it could make the game a little, like the minecraft we know, create a new biome for the end, and also make sure that the grounds of the end are infinite, as many hope is to have a new minerez, I do not say that it is useless to add new minerez, and moreover I find that it would be quite complicated for the mojang team, but if you find a beast of ideas, you are geniuses &nbsp;</p>",

Thus, locomotion within the forest is possible, but difficult, unlike the current one, which requires jumping from tree to tree in the forest canopy.</p>\n<p>IV - The sword should cut leaves and bushes with ease as it does with cobwebs.</p>",
