They should spawn in plains biomes with fog around them. The structure should be in a hallway settings. When you walk in, 2-3 rows of tombstones on each side and a large crypt at the end holding the coffin basement. The tombstones should hold a chest underneath containing gold, iron, diamonds, emeralds, rotten flesh, etc. There should also be exclusive loot at the graveyards as well, especially in the basement area you mentioned</p>\n<p>Zombies could spawn more than any monster, similar to skeletons in soul sand valleys</p>\n<p>A new mob: Ghosts. They spawn inside the graveyards that basically float around the structure. They can go through blocks. They can be either a passive or neutral mob (I'll let y'all decide)</p>\n<p>That's what I've been thinking, but I'm open to critique</p>",

The Warden is so beefy that the Deep Dark is definitely an end-game area, and so any player playing the game normally will have come across enchanting long before they come across the Deep Dark. I think Minecraft as a whole needs more biome-specific loot to encourage what I call \"active exploration\". Since enchanting isn't biome-specific and isn't even late game (falling more into the mid-game), I feel this would be a wasted opportunity when something much cooler could take its place.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Maybe, to open the portal-like frame, a ritual needs to take place, one involving items from differing biomes and dimensions? I feel that would be a better substitute than the presence of a mechanic we already have in a place where it's going to be redundant. Still, love the thought!</p>",
