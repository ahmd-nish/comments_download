        "body": "<p>With the support of raytracing on both Samsung AND iPhone (two generations late lmfao), I totally support this! I was looking at the sad grayed out raytracing button while looking at the video settings and sadly clicked the button a few times. I have a phone (S23 Ultra) that supports it so why don't I use it? I've used raytracing on this phone like once and it ran phenomenally! I personally would love to see this and this could/would change the gap between PC gaming and Mobile gaming! I mean, Samsung standardized Vulkan ffs, BeamNG.drive has a Vulkan version, you know what I would do to have BeamNG on the go? It might seem ridiculous, especially for the select few that actually have the phones capable of it, but this would quite literally be game changing! Maybe mobile companies would be more willing to push out Raytracing GPUs for even lower end phones allowing more people to play it therefore changing the mobile gaming market forever! I don't know what else to say other than I BEG of them to do this!</p>",
