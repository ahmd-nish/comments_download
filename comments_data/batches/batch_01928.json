This main quality should be: The tools can survive falling into the end void. In the nether, netherite tools survive falling into lava and fire, because that is the threat of the nether. The threat in the end is falling in the void. So the end ore tools should survive the void some how, maybe being teleported to the spawn chunks, or maybe a temporary chest can spawn near by with the tools in it. I like the idea of an end egg that you have to crack open to retrieve your tools. But whatever the method, they survive falling in the void. The tools probably don’t even have to be better durability or speed from netherite, they will be useful enough to choose them when traveling the End. </p>",

        "body": "<p>I think trying to improve the game’s enchantment system is good, but I don’t think altering the path to get mending is the best first step. There is a problem, but it’s not mending being to easy to get. Mending is just the bandaid covering the real problem, which is the completely broken durability and enchantment system. The way durability, enchanting, and repairing currently work makes mending a necessity. This is especially true for netherite items and items with multiple high level enchantments. The time investment required to obtain these was to high if they can just break or become “too expensive.” Therefore we NEED mending to make netherite in particular useable. </p>\n\n<p>I do think mending should be a late game item. Being able to pull it from any novice librarian is pretty dumb and that is broken. So I’m glad something is being thought about, but working out a more balanced durability and enchantment system is better. </p>\n\n<p>I also don’t think tying mending to one biome type isn’t great. I think it should still be available just about anywhere though. Adding another step that can be very time consuming to an already incredibly time consuming process in making good end game gear. Some of us can’t sit down to search our world for hours to try and get a biome to spawn in. Some of us hop on for an hour at a time and that’s it. I do think mending needs to be more expensive, and I do like biome specific enchantments, but mending shouldn’t be one. It’s too fundamentally important. </p>",

Currently, the system is broken, as the path forward to progression is trapping a villager in a cage and constantly refreshing the trades with a lectern. This process takes forever, is uninteresting, is unintuitive for new players, and is the same from world to world. This new system adds ACTUAL GAMEPLAY to getting enchantments. In order to get cool trades, the player has to actually, or bring villagers to new areas, which are interesting situations. \"How best to tackle this mountain?\" \"Should I look for a new village or make my own?\" \"Do I make a farmer villager here or trek all the way back for my emeralds?\" All of this with the guarantee of good trades. Just because it was in the game doesn't mean it was balanced. As it is right now, players are rushing full enchantments and everything and then complaining about the replayability of Minecraft. Believe it or not, Minecraft want designed just for the end game. There should be a chance to die, some danger involved in most aspects of the game.\n<br />As for the \"fun for everyone\", I think they knew what they were saying, considering they are payed to have design. Players will have to actually play the game to get op enchants now. What a shame. \n<br />Also by definition, it is a rebalance. The trades were not balanced before, so they're changing it to balance it.</p>",

It would be neat if they took the top 3 item feedbacks (that are within their ethos) and put them to a vote. It would enforce that the feedback site is reviewed especially if they note it a few times. I think Cherry Blossom Biome was one that was on the forms, the sniffer a play on the idea of dinosaurs/prehistoric life (though I don't recall seeing anything on here that resembled it in description.)</p>",
