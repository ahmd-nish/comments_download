For example chest's can double up by placing one next to another, ender chests, have a storage you can access anywhere, with another ender chest. The barrel you can have a block on top of it and you would still be able to open and then the shulker box, where you can break it while keeping the stuff inside. The idea you offered would just be weaker shulker box with nothing unique besides the only one item in the crate. Sure, it could be used as a decoration block, in fact I like that idea, but it would be a useless storage block. How about you have to break it to get the things out of it? Like you could put cobblestone in it, and if you need blocks you could break it? It should have a unique aspect is what I am saying. I like the decoration idea a lot though.</p>",

Perhaps a grid-like system or just placing the items in and a ratio appearing in a dialogue box, showing for each item put in. For example: &nbsp; <em><strong>6 iron ingots</strong></em>, <em><strong>2 coal</strong></em>, <em><strong>1 gold ingot</strong></em> shows up as <strong><em>6 : 2 : 1</em></strong> with the corresponding items below each number.

Even if the ratio is the same, the division of the elements will be different, which will lead to different properties of the alloy.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>Therefore, I think that this alloy system has processing method options in addition to proportions, so it includes heat treatment (normalizing, continuous, tempering and quenching), and the value of the tool will change less. Perhaps an exclusive enchanting method of turning heat treatment into a tool is also a way of thinking.</div>",
