If you're simply making a tunnel, you're covering an extremely small area in a given amount of time compared to the huge areas you can cover by just caving. You can cover 10s of chunks in a few minutes by just exploring. You'll need hours of strip-mining to cover that same area, meaning caving and exploring is often most favorable. You might want to blow up some parts of the underground so that you uncover huge areas and find all of the ores below the stone, so they actually introduced new ways of mining that nobody really used before. Besides, the reduced air exposure doesn't apply to aquifers, which you find all the time, so now there's an incentive to exploring underwater to get the most ores. Most people find strip-mining very tedious and boring, so those people can now explore the beautiful, vast cave systems and still get a lot of ores. For those who might like strip-mining, the reduced exposure is very balancing because now they can find enough ores almost as quickly as those who chose to go caving (which are most of the people).</p>",

One of the main purposes of the cave update is to add strategy to mining, and they've done that by assingning sets and ranges of Y-levels where you find certain amounts of different ores. You need to learn which Y-levels are best for getting any specific ore, and that definitely adds a lot of strategy and fun to mining. You keep using the word density in a very broad sense without explaining what you specifically mean. Nobody should mine from level 61 to -64 and complain about not getting as many ores as they used to in relation to the blocks they mined; there is simply no strategy with that, so it's just a bad way to do it. It's not how mining and searching for resources is meant to be; it's not meant to be a random thing were you just break blocks wherever and get certain amounts anymore. It's now Y-level dependent, so there's meant to be thinking and learning in mining. That's something new players will learn.</p>",

It's about the overall experience you get, not about how many ores you find be clearing chunks or counting or messing around in Creative. Caves simply generate by replacing all of the stone in the underground with Air blocks and Lava sources. The caves before this update were just extremely small, so by simple logic you can tell that they'd intersect with less total ores on average. Ofcourse, the amount of ores per X blocks in a cave has certainly decreased, but you aren't thinking of it from a gameplay perspective. The number of ores you'd find exposed in small Carver Caves is nothing compared to the number of ores exposed in a huge Noise Cave. Trying to make a tunnel is tedious and takes extreme effort. Nobody will try to hollow out an area the size of these caves in search for ores, so density is not really that big of a concern. I really can't lay my hand on the issue you're proposing. I've seen someone in the early snapshots try to get Diamonds (when they were incredibly common deep down) through strip-mining in Creative as a test. At first he found 2 veins close to one another, but he had to mine over 200 more blocks in a straight tunnel to find another vein, compared to seeing one every few blocks he walked inside a cave. I don't have access to Java Edition, so I can't try it myself, but from what I've seen, the amount of ores you by just exploring is pretty balanced compared to the amount you find by strip-mining.</p>",

According to Jim you can find a lot more ores in terms of density. Even if that's the case, this is still pretty balanced because of the sheer amount of time and the Pickaxes it takes to dig a big enough tunnel. So if you enjoy strip-mining (which is rare) or you are just willing to perform such a tedious task to avoid monsters, you'd still find ores at a very good rate (probably higher rates than caving) when considering time, if Jim is correct. Also, like I said, the decreased air exposure doesn't apply to aquifers, which you find very often. So their aim behind all of this is to give different ways and strategies of mining, and fairly cater to a variety of playstyles. They consider those who don't want to deal with the dangers of caves (relatable) versus those who want to explore and take the risks, while also adding new ways of mining that weren't really practiced before, like searching for ores underwater or using TNT to clear some stone. In my opinion, they almost nailed mining and ore generation when it comes to adding more strategy and depth, though a lot of people agree that we might really need more Iron and Diamond frequency. This was an interesting debate :)</p>",

Remember the snapshot that first introduced noise caves? You could find ore every ten blocks and you'd have a stack of diamonds within ten minutes. That would be the result of keeping the \"density\" the same. Since caves are so large, the only way to keep the ores balanced is reducing them. Secondly, the reason many ores have reduced air exposure is to balance strip mining with caving. While caving, every four blocks that are exposed is a block you'd have to break if you were strip mining instead. That's a lot of blocks. Without reduced air exposure, strip mining wouldn't even be a viable option. Players would be forced to explore caves instead. Besides, the update is supposed to make the overall <em>yield</em> of mining and caving better, not the same. Obviously, Mojang believes that it should be slightly harder to get certain resources than it was in 1.16, and they're adjusting accordingly.</p>",
