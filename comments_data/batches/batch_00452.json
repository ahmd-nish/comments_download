A quick way of building upwards faster :)</p>\n<p>I like this idea but I doubt something like this will be added. It doesn't seem (in my eyes) to be something they would add because it takes away from the Minecraft experience. Building towers in 10 seconds takes away from the theme of building in survival as well as think about how they have just added scaffolding, a really smart block to help people build vertically in a natural building way.</p>\n<p>Also think about multiplayer, if an item like this was spammed it could cause major lag and could be a possible greifing tool.</p>",

I think if the Mojang team focused on creating a block similar to the carpenters block from the carpenters mod. Something like a block you can change to properties of (with a tool) which can have the skin of any block you want. This would help a lot of builders out in the game without them having to edit every block to have different properties.</p>\n<p>Carpenters block mod for reference: <a href=\"https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1288875-carpenters-blocks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1288875-carpenters-blocks</a></p>",

Then, with the full bucket, right-click on a cauldron of water to get cooled steel.

There's no reason for it to be in the game UNLESS it has some special characteristic like how gold has the highest enchantability</p>\n<p>Quartz: Same than emerald but with less potential in special characteristics and too similar to iron</p>\n<p>Wood/Stone: The dumbest ideas; too cheap, unnecesary, don't make sense... These would either be terrible or break the game's progression</p>\n<p>Lapis: Unless it has something special with enchanting or xp (like not requiring xp to enchant or giving more xp when using the tools) it just doesn't serve any purpose and even then it seems unnecesary or even unbalanced for some enchantments. Again too easy to get in high quantities so it shouldn't be too good but then it seems better to just use iron or anything else</p>\n<p>Amethyst: Probably the dumbest idea but with some potential. If this is ever added it should probably have bad stats but with some unique and magical use like reducing potion time or enchantments effect. If not this just seems unnecesary and useless</p>\n<p>Titanium: Just doesn't make sense in the Minecraft age and doesn't serve much purpose (or at least there's better options that could do the same and more)</p>\n<p>Silver: It's stronger than gold but weaker than copper... Then what could it do? Since it's the most conductive metal it could maybe have some utility related to that or something magical, but then a tool and armor set isn't the best idea</p>\n<p>Tin: Same than silver. There's better uses for it</p>",
