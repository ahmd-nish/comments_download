Fishing, Farming, Lumber harvesting (log block breaker), Cobblestone block breaker, and Item sorting; are all tasks players would love to automate, and that could be balanced by golems that do cool-downs or need maintenance periodically.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Attacking/Defense- this is mostly filled already but; an improved ranged or smart turret that could be limited by actual ammo consumption (buffed by being able to toss potions) and a shield/wall golem that is 2 tall and will move in front of ranged hostiles to block their shots are two niches that need a golem.
