They will lash out with their stinger, which has long reach, and will deal 1 heart of damage and give poison to their victim for 7 seconds. There is a 15 second cooldown to this before they can use their stinger again. In between these attacks, the scorpion will use their claws to deal damage, and will also have an animation for this too, with the pincers opening and closing. Unlike spiders, they won’t leap at the target as they attack. The pincers deal 4 damage (2 hearts) in normal mode, and are their main form of attack. In terms of drops, I am not yet sure about any which are vanilla enough at the moment. Perhaps something you crush into a powder and use for brewing?</p>",

Overtime it can grow into a spider (I’m not too sure about that feature though). It has 8 hp (4 hearts), which is half the health of a spider, and has the attack strength of 2 hp (1 heart).

It is made out of spider silk, is the size of a chest (so not a full block) and you can find it throughout your world, preferably in caves. The nests spawn together in groups of 1-3, and will be similar to mob spawners, except they do not have a structure. Spiderlings will continuously pop out and up to 7 will spawn before the nest will disappear. The nest has an animation of it slightly moving, pulsating and wriggling about, as though the nest is full of spiders scuttling around. If you break the nest, it will drop what it was made out of – string. However, you may also rarely find other things which may have been caught up and entangled in the nest; nothing crazy like diamonds and equipment, but the occasional stick, iron nugget, spider eye and emerald. However, be warned! If you break the nest, all of the spiderlings will come spilling out at once. You can also shear the nest and it will drop as an item with all the spiderlings still inside, similar to bees and hives (I’m still not sure whether or not silk-touch will be needed). Then you will get an advancement/achievement similar to ‘total beelocation’ except for spiderlings.</p>",

It is much larger than a spider, and in terms of coloration, I think a terrifying jet-black darker than night, with white gleams representing it is shiny and sleek, with all the hair perfectly lined. Sometimes you may even find a couple of spiderlings clinging onto its back. It may seem cute, but means bad news for a player. It has large, glowing red eyes with a tinge of purple, all etched onto its face, above large, sharp mandibles dripping sickly green poison. It prefers to scuttle about in the dark caverns of the underground. If it somehow finds itself on the surface, it will become neutral to the player if it is bright enough, or if someone has been placing too many torches underground. When on the surface, it will try to go beneath sea-level again, where it rarely spawns. Perhaps it could spawn specifically in a biome in the Caves &amp; Cliffs update?&nbsp;</p>",

The spider has 50 hp (25 hearts), which is more than twice the health of an unarmoured player. Like all spiders, it will leap onto the player, dealing 8 hp (4 hearts) of damage, followed by 3.75 seconds of FATAL poison. While the poison will take away only 3 hp (1.5 hearts), it has the power to kill, similar to wither. Currently the only way fatal poison is in the game is when you feed a parrot a cookie in bedrock edition. The brood-spider will also have 60% knock-back resistance, making it even harder to defeat. Furthermore, as it fights, it may place nests as it goes, which spiderlings will hatch out of and aid their mummy. Just to balance things out, the nests only contain 4 spiderlings instead of 7. The nest is also slightly smaller than usual. As a side-note, imagine what a pain it would be if a skeleton was riding it. Upon death, similarly to the scorpions, I’m still not entirely sure what it would drop, except for usual spider drops, a hefty 20 experience orbs and perhaps more string than usual (5 instead of 0-2).</p>",
