When mined, it should drop an ore block.  If the ore block is smelted, it should yield copper.  If taken to a crafting table, maybe four of them could be craftable into a decorative block of malachite with its distinctive light and dark green banding.  The malachite block would be directional, so the sides would have wavy bands that line up, but the top would have more of a bubbly appearance, like an actual chunk of polished malachite.  It would make sense for malachite to be craftable into green dye, too.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, mining the ore block could drop up to 9 malachite fragments that can be smelted into copper nuggets or crafted into malachite blocks.  Smelting the whole ore block (mined with silk touch) or a malachite block would give a copper ingot.  The mechanic would be similar to how nether gold ore works but with an additional smelting stage to turn malachite pieces into nuggets.</p>",

So, it could be used to alter the enchantment shown in the enchantment table,and when you alter it, consumes the Malachite shard, making a cool animation, like the totem of undying</p>\n<p>Another use for it would be combining it with Lapis to make a crystal called&nbsp; Magic Crystal, that can make a new set of magic armor and tools, that would give the same protection as iron, the durability of diamond armor and would be more suitable to enchantments, costing only 2 levels to enchant anything that previously costed 3 levels or more. It aslo could be repaired with Malachite and Lapis, it doesn´t need to be the formed crystal.One final use would be for a Magic Block, also made with Malachite and Lapis, that when put under an Enchanting table would reduce the amount of bookshelfs needed to get lvl 30 by a third.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

That being said if that was still&nbsp; thing maybe a stone pick could mine redstone but not diamond and iron could mine debris. The stone pickaxe wouldn't be used that much anyways and debris needs diamond anyways to be of any use. Obviously the idea needs some refinement, but I would encourage you to refine *your* comment and say exactly what you mean so that I can better form ideas for tempering. Ive also thought that with the introduction of netherite diamonds may lose some of their value so having unlimited diamonds, which many people already have if they play singleplayer, a server whose currency is seperate from diamonds or a server like sci-craft, wont be that impressive and it will be all about the netherite thus balancing tempering to the degree you have cited.</p>",

When the dev's said that they were going to find a better use, rather than make diamond up gradable to netherite, and people said we like the netherite thing really disappointed me. Mainly because that is it's only use. Plus for such a cheap block. I mean, you could have this block before you have a iron pickaxe. I also like this concept. The only things I don't like is the examples you gave. I get the gold on tools and the iron idea is ok, but all the others are too overpowered. Like the gold on armor for example. The whole purpose of the piglin feature is to give gold a purpose. Other than that it is pointless. Good concept, but we could find better uses for each mineral.&nbsp;</p>",

But gold is also going to be used for trading with piglins in the coming update, so I feel that this would be perfect. Also, it isn't too op because you still need to mine the coal, get the water, and you still only have a 60% chance to get anything even using 10 coal. Mojang could also just increase that amount if they found it too op, but I doubt they will. Also,&nbsp; this would be difficult to farm since the only way to get auto coal is by using a wither skeleton farm (which, needless to say, is extremely endgame) and the gold output would barely be worth it with pigman farms in the game right now, especially considering the exp factor from the pigman farm. This would be a very nice midgame block to use in conjunction with a carrot farm to produce sufficient food, since by midgame you should have lots of coal and better ways to smelt and light up without it.</p>",

But the alchemy table has so much potential even to the point were you can make previous uncraftable items like the totem of undying for example if you wanted to craft it you would need some gold, emerald, 100 levels of exp and that special drop from that OP boss. I don't really know, I would like to keep the boss and its drop unnamed because maybe you can make an idea from that.</p>",
