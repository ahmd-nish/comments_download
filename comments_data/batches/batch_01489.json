I wonder if the ender dragon egg could be made more useful than a trophy like if it had a specific enchantment or could do something if you threw it something? And perhaps fireflies could spawn at night, in the swamp, jungle and plains and light up the area a bit? Perhaps they could drop glowstone dust when they die. And nests! I mean like bird nest and more birds types - I'd really like to see weaver birds and their nest that they weave - it's so cool! Just a few thoughts for more new things.&nbsp;</p>",

My interpretation of this for Minecraft is that you can actually tame a baby mimic!

It would be easier to obtain, and could be obtained earlier in the game. However, it wouldn't entirely replace shulker boxes, because like any pet, you have to worry about the mimic's safety. If the mimic dies, it drops everything in its inventory, and if you can't fit it all in your inventory, then you have some tough choices to make regarding what items you keep and what items you have to leave behind. Therefor, shulker boxes wouldn't be rendered obsolete, because Mimics would require maintenance and care to keep them from dying and dropping all your stuff, whereas shulker boxes just can sit in your inventory and hold stuff, and are much less risky to use.</p>\n<p><strong>T.L.D.R - Adding mimics in the game, include baby mimics that are able to be tamed and used as extra portable inventory space. This would not make shulker boxes obsolete, because mimics can die and drop your stuff, and you might have to leave stuff behind.</strong></p>",

(Fix: keep them away from the main island. Perhaps make end crystals kill them, but prioritize healing the ender dragon, or simply make them unable to spawn)\n<br />2) bridging to other islands would be a challenge. They would force you to take precautions like building a railing when you bridge through the end. (Make it so they only spawn above solid ground. Maybe the ground above their spawn must be 3 blocks thick or something.)\n<br />3) phantoms only spawn after the player hasn’t slept for a few nights.

I play bedrock, and ghost are super annoying, I've heard that in Java you don't run into them a lot, but in bedrock their constant, there's always at least one ghast in sight, and sometimes two of them will spawn in the same spot and gang up on you! They're super annoying, and they're literally the biggest danger I face traversing the nether. Phantoms would probably have similar spawn rates (and probably more equally annoying across versions), they would be life threatening when bridging (some people say \"Just pearl\", but that's not always possible/easy/safe).</p>\n<p>As of right now, end islands are vary safe, which makes sense because they have nothing of value on them. End cities are super challenging, but have great stuff. Phantoms would make end life harder, and I don't want the boring end to become even more annoying.</p>\n<p>However, if Phantoms were upgraded, and the end was updated, I think they would be plausible.</p>",

If you harvested some of those rare crystals (because it needs to be somewhat difficult), you could combine them with the glow ink/sticks, and maybe glass as well, to make \"glowing glasses\"/\"night vision glasses\". Or, you could even combine the \"glow ink\" with a stick to make a \"glow torch\", that could not only provide the possibility of having torches underwater, but also be a way for the player to get torches without mining coal, in underwater caves where mining is difficult (streamlined caving is also something that needs to be addressed in this update, as caving can become a torch-management game very quickly). There are many other crafting possibilities with \"glow ink\" like \"glowing books\" or \"glowing armor\"; use your imagination to imagine all of the things that would be better when glowing (pretty much everything!).&nbsp;</p>",

I would also like to see unicorns, pegasi, and more magical horses. Back in the Mo’Creatures days I loved collecting these guys. Also, your description an variant ideas are wonderful! Although, I would prefer it to just be a black, fiery horse rather than a fiery wither skeleton horse. It would look too much like the skeleton horse and I think they would take away from each other. I think it would be best if it was just a black horse with different colored fire particles and textures depending on the variant. Regardless, I want this so badly! Voted!</p>",
