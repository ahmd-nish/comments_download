That being said I hope eventually more golems will be added, even a copper one, but their focuses should be on \"Quality of Life\" being automation for farms, fishing, lumber, maybe even cobblestone block breakers.</p>\n<p>The aging mechanic the introduce gives more balance to doing automation, and you could set a limited life span based on how often it's refreshed. Though if done this way once waxed the golem would either move slower or would be frozen like a statue. I would prefer player-made constructs to handle Quality of Life automation than using the serfdom approach we have for farming currently. And a constant request is for automation, with magic, Golems are a clear choice for this line of work, literally built for the job. Now to add more balance it may require some treasure-level loot to build golems however I think most players would take that trade.&nbsp;</p>",
