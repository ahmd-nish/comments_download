However, in Minecraft dungeons, the piglin merchant drinks some kind of potion to stay safe from zombification, and so I think that Mojang should add a piglin safe potion or something. What do you guys think about curing zombified piglins?</p>",

Just like in the process to cure a zombie villager, the zombie piglin produces red particles and begins to shiver, however, being a neutral mob--- the zombie piglin turns into an aggressive state (like a sick animal). The mob will call to other zombie piglin nearby, and will try to attack the player itself, however it is weakened because of the potion. When the curation is complete, the piglin (like you said) will not be aggressive towards the player, even if the player isn't wearing gold armor, or even mining gold, or attacking other piglin. The cured piglin will only attack the player if the player attacks this piglin directly. A cured piglin does not turn back to a zombie piglin if in the Overworld, but has the same trading value. The cured piglin still hunts hoglins, loves to collect gold, and wearing flashy armor.\n<br />I love this feedback idea...please add it to minecraft, Mojang!</p>",

Having a fairy equipped gives you an xp multiplier. you could equip multiple to fly around you, but doing so would increase the chances of you hitting them by accident in combat. Having this way to get bonus xp would be a little too powerful so catching fairies should be somehow limited to the endgame.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Honestly, I just want to play minecraft with a little buddy by my side, other than wolves.</p>",

That's how I found this thread.</p>\n<p>I think the main issue with your idea, is the gender. Minecraft (from my point of view) is a very gender neutral game for a reason. And throwing in male and female mob variants will mess with that message. I think different hair styles and clothes are a good idea, but don't attach gender to it. That fairy with a dress could be male or female, we don't know.</p>\n<p>And secondly, Minecraft already has a fae-like mob, the vex. And a system that works with/and/or around it would fit much better in the over all game.</p>",

I never cared much about diamonds being unrenewable, because they were not needed in large amounts and basically not at all in late game of technical playthroughs. But armour is always needed and there will always be some that breaks or gets lost, so this change adds a constant chore to have to go back to branch-mining over and over again forever. This is exactly the reason why I never use Netherite armour. But downgrading to iron is not a great option.<br>There aren't even any alternative ways to get diamonds, only mining (or loot chests, but that takes much longer). Iron at least occurs underground, in various loot chests, drops from golems and zombies, is given by piglins and armour smelts to a little bit of it, so you can choose how you want to play to obtain it. That is not the case for diamonds. In most Skyblock or Superflat playthroughs it is even impossible to obtain them and therefore it would also be impossible to get diamond armour.<br>I think the trading change itself could be good, but only if it's accompanied by some way to renewably obtain diamonds.<br>I like the cartographer changes and the earlier librarian changes. I have no strong feelings one way or the other for the rest of the villager changes.</p>",

I mean, it's an interesting idea, and probably more balanced, but now villagers feel a bit too nerfed. Yes, it's nice that armorers now always buy iron, but spreading armor trades across biomes? With really bad enchantments on them? In the time it takes to gather the resources for enough emeralds to level up at least three armorers (unless you want cursed armor), as well as locate villages for the proper biomes, a player could just go mining for diamonds to get enough resources to craft multiple sets of armor. Armorers are now more work than they're worth except for the late game, when diamonds and zombie curings are easier to get. Since the iron armor and shield trades are pretty worthless even early-game, it looks like armorers have become mostly output processors for players' iron farms.</p>",

They don't have actual forms, but they probably will soon which will be good if there is new content.</p>\n<p>2. The Enchant Book Change: The villagers were the only way to consistently get the enchant books, and it has been changed so that you must venture to all of the different types of villages. This is a bad change, it doesn't make the game more fun or add new content, it takes the current content and stretches it super thin. It's especially detrimental to smaller servers that need a world border. Provide a new way to consistently get enchants. I do not mind if they are harder to obtain, but it should not be so tedious.</p>\n<p>3. The Diamond Armor Trade: Needing diamonds to get the diamond armor almost makes sense. Almost. Getting diamonds wasn't that hard before the Caves and Cliffs update. But since that update, mining has become much more difficult as open caves mean players immediately get swarmed by large amounts of mobs and die quickly even if you have diamond armor on. So is Diamond Armor really worth the mining trip and dying? What about people who don't enjoy mining? Should they be forced to do it just to get that armor? The villagers solved this problem by having an alternate method of getting Diamond armor. You can make diamonds easier to get, make diamonds more common, and add a new armor that's harder to get, or simply revert this change.</p>",

(this will give more value to armor found in loot chests after the player is maxed out ! and will give more raw diamonds to trade with other armorers !)</p>\n<p>with this said, every other changes is welcome and i am looking forward to future changes, also, some past problems still need to be adressed, like the tediousness of moving villagers and the level cap of anvils, but i have faith</p>",

Instead of having biome specific books, librarians should buy an “enchanted book” (in one of the 1.14 snapshots, librarians used to sell enchanted books without enchants such as unbreaking on them) and an extra item for the enchantment which varies with the level, for example, for mending you would require an enchanted book and 3 bottles o’ enchanting, for a fire aspect book, you would require blaze rods fire aspect 1 = 2 rods and fire aspect 2 = 4 rods.\n<br />2. You can acquire an enchanted book by disenchanting a normal enchanted book, like unbreaking, an enchanted book varies based on the level of enchantment, for example if you disenchanted efficiency 1 or 2 you would get  a lesser enchanted book, if you disenchanted  efficiency 3 or 4 you would get an enchanted book and if you disenchanted efficiency 5 you would get a greater enchanted book, and the higher the level of the enchantment, the higher the level of the “enchanted book “ is required when trading with a librarian.</p>",

Maybe max-level can even sell maps for rare structures like ancient cities?</p>\n\n<p>There is still the issue of actually transporting villagers to those biomes once you've found them, though, and villagers are notoriously difficult to travel with. Getting villagers to jungle or swamp biomes, for example, will likely require players to build railways through the nether. Which isn't the worst thing, especially if players can access the nether roof, but that can still be frustrating to have to build. Perhaps there can be some new behavior introduced to a villager to make this easier... maybe if a villager doesn't have a workstation and isn't in a village, a player can lure it around using an emerald? Or maybe they'll just naturally loiter near a player in that case, if the player doesn't sprint out of their following range. That way, a player could lead them between villages easier.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, this is more of a Librarian-related idea, but given that max-level books will be harder to come by, combining things in an anvil should be made easier. The exp limit is old and unappreciated and arbitrary. My opinion is that it shouldn't exist at all, and that compounding experience cost should only occur when a new type of enchantment is added. E.g. sharp 1 + sharp 1 doesn't cost extra, but sharp 1 + fire aspect 1 does.</p>",

Requiring diamonds to get diamond armour from villagers defeats the whole point of getting diamond armour from villagers.

I like having that low level \"1 block = 4 emeralds\" thing for mid-tier players, but I'd love a \"10 blocks = 48 emeralds\" or something around that, giving a little bit of a higher price for the bulk sale, also making it more useful for later players. Could implement this by making it chance, or you could simply change one of the biomes' villager trades to have the bulk instead.<br><br>Now, I would normally suggest putting that for the Swamp or Jungle Villagers since they need more work put into them, <strong>BUT...</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Add Swamp and Jungle Villages<br><br></strong>They made a way to find all the other villages, which is great, but because baby villagers get assigned to the biome they're born in rather than based on their parents' biomes, trading halls will still have to \"ship\" villagers across their world. This can't be automated, either, due to unloaded chunks. However, imagine a world for a second where villagers were based on their parents...<br><br>Yes, Swamp and Jungle is out of the picture unless you get super lucky terrain gen, but these village types are long overdue, anyway. With that, a player would simply have to set up 3 more breeders than usual to their current halls. With a 50/50 chance of being either parent and 7 villages, you can have 7 unique parents (with a duplicate of your favorite). Only 1 villager from each village would need transported to your base, once.</p>",

Now, we have to run around searching for rare biomes, ex: swamp for mending, an enchantment that is necessary for a survival world. Finding biomes takes a LOT longer then refreshing trades.

You should be adding more things on the end of progression, not making to more grindy to get there.This doesn't make getting enchantments harder, it just makes it take longer. The librarian changes are horrid, and do the opposite of what they're trying to do. The armorer changes are fine, except for the blatant disregard for superflat player. Anyways, that's all.

Also, getting Trident enchantments are still going to be a challenge, it is already extremely hard to find a Trident, trying to enchant a perfect Loyalty and Riptide Trident will be much harder. Increasing the frequency they appear on ocean ruins should be a good way to make it easier. Finally players aren't going to know they need to breed villagers in a swamp/jungle to get those villager types. Adding some kind of achievement can help with this, or a better idea is to add abandoned village structures for the swamp and jungle, maybe even make it so zombie villagers don't generate with the structure.</p>",

The crux of the matter is that transporting villagers to biomes such as swamps or jungles is incredibly difficult and tedious.

Most of the changes being made make life much harder.</p>\n<p>Jungle and Swamp villagers providing a way of reliably obtaining chainmail is interesting and unique and should be a change that is kept. However, it would be nice to have a way of moving enchantments from a piece of armour to a book using the grindstone - no one is going to use chainmail armour for very long, so the mending from swamp villagers is wasted.</p>\n<p>All of the villager rebalancing changes however should be more intuitive in-game. Younger players who don't keep up with the online aspects of Minecraft won't know that villagers' trades are biome-specific if they are used to the random aspect; they might presume it is still random, constantly re-rolling villagers thinking they simply have bad luck, achieving the opposite of what these changes set out to do.</p>\n<p>Finally, coming back to my first point, it would be much better to create an easier method of transporting mobs such as villagers such as a revised rail system.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>",

Adding to such, players like me aren't going to want to drag those new villagers BACK to our base in order to have quick access to them; Do you not realize how most players use the trading system in the game? We trade our goods and such to other villagers before going to our trusty librarians to get the books we may need, creating a thousand block gap between that now is just going to be a hassle to new and old players alike.

I agree to the idea of making diamond armor require diamonds, so that in most worlds, people can't skip mining entirely, but maybe then give wandering traders a slight chance to sell diamonds at a high price, so that you can still get diamond armor in closed borders, superflats, and skyblock islands, as well as many other scenarios. Alternatively, make it so that diamonds can ever-so rarely drop from a creeper (or other hostile mob, but creepers are the most iconic for the most iconic ore in the game) when killed by a player, unaffected by looting, so that normal players will see the drop and be happy with their luck, but players with limited resources can still get diamond armor and tools.I also still feel as though the addition of trading different maps fixes the problems with librarians with very few of the people who had problems with it.</p>",

The librarian could have books with new enchants (smelting touch vein miner 2x2 mine) or higher level enchants not obtainable by anvil (looting 4 power 6). The toolsmith in the jungle could have an axe that can destroy an entire tree. I think it would be cool to need to make each trade with the villager multiple times to unlock this final tier. None of the final trade tier items can be reduced with anything other than hero of the village.</p>",

Also, the enchantments should be better for the armorer especially with the librarian not giving you any higher end enchantments easily.

Now imagine the guy that gave you the gift (Mojang) tearing it out of your hands and replacing it with a way smaller gift which is still good, but not as good as the other one. Thats how I and many other casual players feel if you implemented these changes like that. And I am talking about both the librarian and armorsmith changes. The cartographer changes are actually not that bad. I really like them. They would give them a purpose... other than turning all your paper into emeralds after a few zombifications, but even then the librarian is better suited for that... But speaking of zombifications, don't change them. I always thought the price getting lower with each zombification rather than just decreasing once was a feature, not a bug. Why don't you just pull out your magic wand and turn that bug into a feature like you always do when a bug is loved by the community?

It’s those systems which need a rework more than librarians. It players want to grind it out let them. </p>\n\n<p>That said, I love the idea of biome specific trades &amp; guaranteed book. “Go grab a map and explore!” is great when combined with better structure loot.

The maps cannot be differentiated from each other. Please, it is a simple job to do.</p>\n<p>3- Don't stop now, the villagers need to continue to be modified. Please don't stop and settle now. It would be great if you could add unique and exclusive items to the villagers (for example). That can't be obtained anywhere else in the game. Enchantments are great, but something special is needed. Wandering Trader included.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for your continued work!</p>",

As simple as removing the \"too expensive\" limit and letting the player pay the xp but keep reparing/combining their tools/armour, this also gives a benefit to saving up many levels or getting a good xp farm (relatively advanced things that are defenitely not early game easy to build, or at least ones that could easily let a player get to 50+ levels).</p>\n<p>I also think that this update will need an easier way to transport villagers, maybe not necesarily the \"villagers follow you when you hold emeralds like sheep\" as this would be to easy, but maybe make an item or minecart type/sadle/something that makes villagers want to get on minecarts. This could make moving villagers alot less frustrating to move (the item could be traded with some villager type -leatherworker? - or found in mineshafts for example) and also give making rail lines a new reason, as now with elytras you really have no reason to make a long rail line.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>These are my thoughts!

However, this still does not solve the major issue with villagers, tedium. Looking up what biome you need for a particular trade is not skill based, and creating 7 trading halls in 7 different locations 2 of which will not even have villagers to start with is just the same thing 7 times over. This problem is made even worse if some of the biomes are very far away or you want to make a central trading hall, as you would have to move villagers over long distances. Changing one tedious thing for another tedious thing is still a tedious thing.<br><br>What if instead of the trade type being based on where the villager was born, it is instead based on the type of material used to make the trading station? For instance oak wood could be used for plains trades whereas acai could be used for savannah trades. This way, the player still has to go out and find various biomes, exploring their world, but they do not have to transport villagers across it, and the biome-trade connection is maintained. I also think this could be nice for builders, as it would give them more block types to work with. My favorite application for this is Librarians, since it makes their lecterns kind off like wands, with the type of magic they can do dependent on what tools they use.<br><br></p>\n<p>Thank you for listening to community feedback, overall I like where this is going.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Adding cartographer maps to point to these biomes is really neat, but <strong>it is</strong> <strong>not enough</strong>. New players will group those maps with Ocean Explorer and Woodland Explorer and not realize it's for different villager trades. It's fine if you don't add villages for these biomes, but something needs to be added. It could be something like the igloo villager curing thing but for Swamp and Jungle. Or it could be abandoned zombie villages in these biomes, prompting players to cure the zombie villagers and discover new trades. Have the new maps point to these structures instead of the Jungle Temple and Witch Hut. There just needs to be something that leads new players in the direction of discovering this without looking at the wiki and I think adding a structure like this would be a really cool way of doing it.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>",

I understand the intent being to balance the system but disagree with this method as experienced players would find a way to circumvent this without much difficulty which would just make villager trading that little bit more annoying. I do like the trade for iron blocks being added provided the iron does sell for a high price. Similar to my argument against the diamonds being required for diamond armor restricting these trades to very annoying/difficult villagers to obtain makes the system more annoying to work within, in this case their isn't many competing trades like with librarians making this feel unnecessary. I believe cursed armor being sold at cheaper prices is a good change since curses aren't removable via grindstone.

Also, limiting the enchantment levels on the armor runs into the issue of the anvil xp amounts as well.

It may not be a huge amount of work now but making all of these trades require different biomes increases that work a lot.</p>\n\n<p>Having places where enchantments are more likely could be very handy, although we'd need ways to find all of them too. Currently finding an ancient city can take a lot of time and effort, which I think is fine, but making mending so difficult to get makes the game a lot more tedious for casual players.</p>\n\n<p>It feels like a lot of these changes are focused on hardcore players, at the expense of casual players. Which makes sense, it's going to be mostly hardcore players of the game that take the time to comment on changes.

If Mojang is dead-set on these biome dependent trades however, I have some suggestions to make things less grindy.</p>\n<p>Villagers for hire: villagers without a job can be interacted with and paid an amount of emeralds to travel with the player. No limit on how many can travel with the player. They act similarly to tamed animals where they will teleport to the player and stay nearby. They also forget any claimed bed once hired. When the player wishes to release them from service, simply interact again and choose release option. Once released they will go back to acting like villagers in the area where released. Players wouldn't be able to hire villagers once they have a job.</p>\n<p>Totems of summoning and Villager shamans: This one's a little more complex. Villages have a happiness level. Villagers that have a job and can go to bed at night and are safe from mobs will be happier. Space to roam also. Once happiness reaches a certain level, a baby villager will be chosen and will become a shaman upon becoming an adult. The Shaman will sell totems of summoning that can be used to mark villagers and by right clicking with the totem they will be summoned to that location. Once summoned they forget their job block and bed. Totem of summoning can then be used on another or same villager but only 1 at a time per totem. Totems don't stack.

Experienced players may want or have need to get armor without going on a massive grind to mine for diamonds, for instance if playing a challenge map like skyblock or superflat, or wanting several backup sets of armor. Though, the fact that netherite works in this way probably makes this not as huge of an issue as it kind of already exists. I do think it makes sense to the average player to require some mining, but being able to use villagers as a cost reducer to make it less tedious. However, for average players, I think it's expected to sort of stick to one village, and so I would make all four types of diamond armor available from each singular village. Perhaps each village could have certain types for cheaper?<br>Could also have the enchantments be better but have them cost more emeralds on some pieces. For instance, maybe Plains villages would sell:<br>Boots -&gt; Helmet (armor swap)<br>32 + 4dia: Prot I Chest (more expensive)<br>16 + 2dia: Prot I Legs (cheaper)<br>12 + 2dia: Prot III Boots (better enchant)<br>If each village had 1 armor swap, an average player sticking with one could use that to get the fourth piece of armor, while the most advanced players could still get diamond armor for very cheap by assembling a chain of villagers from different biomes - Cursed Boots would cost 0 diamonds, and then they could be traded up for each other type of armor.</p>",

Once again, on it's own, this is nothing but a good change. However, it seems to suggest that the idea of locking certain enchantments behind certain biome villagers is still mostly unchanged behind the scenes and this change only addresses one of the issues with that system. Maps will be a great way to find new villages, but doesn't make it easier to create villages that don't spawn naturally or make it easier to transport villagers; two of the biggest issues with the proposed changes. One of the simplest fixes could be to simply put rare enchantments like Mending in more accessible village types (naturally spawning villages) but have the cost be high/require late game materials (Echo Shards for example) to complete the trade. This makes the enchantment accessible to late-game players, but doesn't make it overpowered for anyone who stumbles across it early.</p>",

I do wish there was at least a slight chance the a new cartographer might pick from the non-matching set of maps. For example, a Desert Cartographer might have a 30% chance each of selling Savanna/Plains/Jungle, and a 10% chance of selling one of Desert/Swamp/Tiaga/Snowy. I would even extend that list to other unique biomes: cherry grove, mangrove swamp, drip stone, mushroom island. Yes, breaks the progression loops, but not in either a predictable or game-breaking way. Consider it moment of surprise and joy if your cartographer happens to sell such a map in the master level.</p>",

Biome maps are a HUGE improvement on the game as a whole- wandering aimlessly searching for a specific biome is tedious and exhausting, especially without elytra and a rocket setup (and nobody wants to use their elytra without mending firmly in place). Closer biomes will also help (though won’t fix) the villager moving problem. Spending 5 hours searching for a jungle (and not even finding one) really soured me on “”exploring.”” I am ambivalent to the armorer change- not thrilled about the hassle of accessing every armor piece in diamond, but it does fix how cheap picking up a full set for 4 emeralds felt. Needing to set up a jungle/swamp village to access chainmail armor armor does feel special but you can absolutely get a full set much easier setting up a zombie/skeleton farm. This update goes a long way towards assuaging my concerns from the last one to a point where I’d feel quite satisfied if it were put in as-is. Biome maps are something I’ve really wanted for some time. </p>",

I'm a pretty big player of superflat, and making the diamond armour require diamonds to buy it from villagers will make the superflat experience 100x harder. Finding enough diamonds for an enchantment table, jukebox and some of the new armour trims is already hard enough. Image also having to get the diamond for gear. (For those who don't know, diamonds are only found in structures in superflat, cause there is no mining.)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also the biome based change to librarians, might be even worse. A basic superflat world is exclusively in the plains biome, cutting off very important books like mending.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A possible solution to the armorer is to make one armourer sell only one random piece of diamond gear, so you will have to cycle through a couple to get the full set you want. Also going from the taiga villager idea (where you can exchange gear) there can be a new block or a rare villager (something like the wandering trader) that can switch diamond gear, <strong>for no additional cost</strong>. I think this is important because not every one will switch four pairs of boots for a full set, and smelting diamond gear isn't possible anyway.</p>\n<p>Another thing that Mojang can change is making curing a villager exclusive to one time, so people can't abuse cure to get trades for only 1 emerald. If the player tries to infect them again they will either die of become a zombie.&nbsp;</p>",

First, why I need to <strong>use</strong> emerald to switch chestplate for blank helmet in Taiga instead of just made it by myself?&nbsp; Second, for those players who get used to build farms to get resources, banning a way to regenerate a thing (such as the diamond armor after this update) will just push them to use more bugs to duplicate items, or simply not play the newest version. People used to use bugs to duplicated shulker shells, but after the Shulker could be spawned after being hit by other Shulkers in 1.17, most of these people would make a farm to get them instead of simply duplicating them.</p>",

There are many, <em>many</em> different playstyles found within the minecraft community, not all of which like to explore.

I can confidently say that the risk is no longer worth the reward. I am content to spend two hours cycling villager trades to find high powered books, I think that method works well; you need to have the dedication to get what you want, but it's worth it in the end. But now that will be impossible. Even if I find the correct biome and manage to breed the correct villagers and transport them wherever I need to transport them, the ultimate reward—powerful enchanted books—is impossible to get with this method.

More hidden villager types (mushroom and cherry villagers for example) like this could be really beneficial to spreading out the more interesting trades across the landscape, and help encourage new players too explore all of these differently dressed villagers.</p>\n<p>Finally, we need a better way to transport villagers (in addition to the easy way of curing zillagers on site), namely: with camels.

However, for the Jungle, I think the Jungle temple does not align with the \"destination perspective\", that being, as there are little other maps to similar temples, such as the one in the desert. I suggest two changes, then:<br><br>1) Make a desert map direct to either a desert village, or a desert temple as well, to match the given theme.<br>2) Make the jungle map lead to the ancient archeology ruins for that biome, and add a \"Forest Explorer Map\" that would lead to ruins in any of the forests, since they're rather hard to come by.<br><br>One of, if not both of these changes will, imo, make the Cartographer a better source of exploration objectives for the player.</p>",

If your going to make a master level villager sell the base level one of an enchantment either make it a higher level like Protection II or III for a master level villager and/or remove or buff the anvil too expensive tag. I recommend either level 100 or 150 as the limit because in modern Minecraft with XP farms reaching level 100 or 150 is doable quite easily.

As many have already said, here and in the prior feedback space, the move to restrict enchantments to certain biomes simply adds more tedium - not more fun. Y'all are designers, you should understand the concept that improving a game should come from adding features, not restricting what is already there. Just as with the recent change to netherite armor, you are making changes that remove current features and hide them behind many more layers of work simply to, what... extend gameplay and perceived value? Minecraft is a very \"grindy\" game, naturally, so I can't be opposed to that in concept, but boy - these latest moves just seem to be steps in a very unappealing design direction. The Allay, for example, doesn't particularly interest me, and that's okay - I simply don't pursue playing with them; what you're doing here, though, is proposing changes that alter the rules I already play by and that removes player choice. You've stated that the villager trade changes are intended to make it \"more fair and fun for everyone\", but I honestly don't see how that is the case - not for everyone. Is it fair to the more casual player, such as myself, that I'll lose access to some of these trade options because I'm not intending to travel everywhere and establish multiple village points of contact? Because I can tell you, directly, that it certainly doesn't sound fun.</p>",

I feel this will gate many players in skyblock, limited worlds, and superflat. Diamonds are not renewable meaning armor is now not either. Diamonds already got a buff with the introduction of armor trims. I feel this change gates players and rather than costing diamonds it should cost another material like copper or just increase the emerald cost.</p>\n<p>3. Conversion price changes. Despite it being a heavy nerf I actually like the change to conversion and price decrease. I feel it will make the player be more creative with getting emeralds as they will need more. So while it creates more work it is fun work. It also helps peaceful players as using villagers for them is now slightly more viable.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I feel changing and nerfing villagers is good.

Namely, the enchants that require combining 4 books to get to max enchant level. (I can understand not offering the player max level enchant, especially on enchants with 4 or 5 levels, but going beyond 1 under max level can get prohibitive for the player.)<br>2) As of this update, diamond armor charging diamonds. While making the armor pieces more expensive is fine, charging the diamonds themselves is a step too far, as this is a hindrance to certain types of play styles, such as Skyblock style maps, or just players who dislike or don't have the time to go mining. <br>- Side note regarding the enchantments of armorers: Having different biome armorers make different enchants is a good thing, in my opinion, and follows the same line of thinking as the changes to the librarians.</p>",

It takes much more effort (exploring and leveling up villagers) and much less gain. In this case I would rather craft the armor parts not available for sale in the biome I settle in. And cursed armor sold by savannah villagers seem pretty unfair for players who want to settle in this biome. Cursed armor can't be re-enchanted with enchantment table, and players can't swap armor parts for specific uses or even just showing off their Minecraft skin to their friends. The \"lower price\" is next to worthless in the slightly longer run.</p>\n\n<p>And regarding the previous experimental change to librarian trades, the whole thing brings even worse effort and gain ratio.\n<br />I think one simpler way to balance the overpowered trading is:\n<br />1. Enchantment levels of books correspond to the level of villagers\n<br />(Trade options of high level librarians will always be high level/rare and vice versa)\n<br />2. The contents and prices of enchantment books change after every 3 trades or so.\n<br />(Like, after buying 3 books of Mending, the option changes to book of Sharpness IV)\n<br />This way there will not be permanently useful or useless librarian villagers, and it is always worthwhile to level up librarian villagers.</p>",

With the cartographer, you could easily locate a swamp biome, for example, but if you wanted to bring villagers there, maybe to get a swamp villager, it would still be a hassle. I think it would be great if villagers followed the player if the player was holding an emerald, that way they could be transported thousands of blocks without needing to be put in a boat or something. This would probably still be balanced, because while the villager is following you, you would need to make sure it doesn’t get killed by a zombie or fall off a cliff or whatever.</p>\n\n<p>The second thing is that I think there should be a way to “convert” villagers. How I imagine this would work is, if you bring a random villager to a swamp biome, for example, and did something (I don’t know what yet) the villager would become a swamp villager, and thus offer mending books at master level if it’s a librarian, etc. this would make it so that after you bring villagers to a swamp, you don’t need to breed them to get a swamp villager.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise these new changes are really interesting, keep up the great work mojang!</p>",

        "body": "<p>After feeling out these changes, seeing it focuses on new players, I think a useful mechanic would be having an increased likelyhood - if not guarantee - of having a cartographer in villages or possibly just the first village a player encounters. Then, I think if the first time a player enters the proximity of a cartographer, the villager should seek out the player and drop the first exploration map for free. This would give players an intuitive way of realizing villagers have unique trades and push them to right click to figure out how they can get another map there or at the next village. I would also be a good intro to maps in general since finding treasure maps requires less early-player-friendly tasks. Next, I think a system of ''recruiting' villagers would be excellent with the increased difficulty of finding all the unique biome trades and would allow for the continued possibility of making trading halls without the whole kidnappingy forced labory vibe and without the need for huge rail systems or tedious boat travel. Perhaps doing favors or offering some sort of pay could convince them to leave and travel with the player. This could also introduce a fun new escort mission-type mechanic to make sure they remain safe while traveling. Maybe recruited cartographers always give free maps to find the next village as well. Lots of fun new possibilities there I think, and once again that hopefully balances difficulty while removing some morally questionable common processes.</p>",

You would either need to devise a way to move all of your villagers (a notoriously difficult mob to move around) over massive distances, or move over those distances yourself with every trade which is hardly worth the effort for gear and enchantments that are worse or more expensive now than they were before these changes. The added effort of locating and moving to these biomes just makes me wonder why I would pick trading with an armorer over mining the diamonds for a full set myself.</p>\n<p>That said I do see the potential of reducing randomness by making trades more consistent, I just don't think biome dependency is the way to do it. I would much rather see a system where interacting with a villager in a certain way could change the items they will unlock, so that the actual act of interacting with the villager and working to get the trades you want can be more engaging rather mindlessly cycling trades or running all over your world to get a relatively unrewarding trade.</p>",

That said, I think that by the point in the game that you'd want to search for specific biomes and have the resources to trade for maps you will have already found many of the biomes/villages on the list. Early-game, searching for the biomes manually is both faster and more fun.

Making it harder isn't the issue, the issue is these changes make the game harder in an entirely uninteresting way. Ultimately my issue with the changes boils down to the fact that villagers, as they were, took a lot of tedious setup (moving/breeding/leveling-up villagers, refreshing trades, getting the resources to trade for emeralds, etc) to get to the point where they were could be considered overpowered, at which point easy access to armour and enchantments feels like a good late-game reward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Other thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Making armour require diamonds is an absolute shame for modes like skyblock and superflat, where diamonds are unobtainable, although I understand the change.</li>\n<li>Curse of binding armour as a master level trade isn't really worth the time involved.</li>\n</ul>",

Finding all seven different village types is definitely going to be a tedious process, however I believe it could work if the following conditions are met:</p>\n<p>A. Reasonable alternatives to villager trading need to exist. Increasing the odds of finding enchanted books is a great step in the right direction, however I think it should be more than just four books. I also believe that anvils must be changed to be a more reasonable alternative to Mending. Remove the \"too expensive\" limit and drastically reduce the penalty for repairing a tool multiple times and mending will no longer feel like a necessary enchantment for early game players, while still providing plenty of value for late game players.</p>\n<p>B. There should be a reasonable reward for putting in the increased effort for trading. If you have to find a jungle, build a village in that jungle, and level up one of the villagers to master level in order to get an Unbreaking trade, the reward should be Unbreaking III, not Unbreaking II. If you have to find at least two villages in order to trade for a full suit of diamond armor, the \"diamond discount\" should be more than just 50%. I think 1-3 diamonds per armor piece is a more reasonable price for the amount of effort involved.</p>\n<p>In short, I believe more alternatives to villager trading and better rewards for those that do put in the effort would lead to a much more balanced system for everyone.</p>",

The previous tedium and power of librarian cycling, zombie curing and armorers was I think unbalanced and induced uniformity. To both benefit players who enjoy villagers and those who would rather use separate systems to achieve progression, I think an overhaul was greatly needed.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- Enchantments - Librarians were both the overwhelmingly best way to get specific enchants, though a tedious method at that. While I really enjoy the concept of biome unique trades I fear this will do little to reduce tedium while making in near impossible to reliably find many desirable enchants. The design technology used for Soul Speed &amp; Swift Sneak is a perfect partial solution here. By mapping certain enchantments to specific structures, it grants those who don't want to engage with villagers an alternative way to reliably find needed enchants. This prerelease seems to have begun adopting this approach and I couldn't be happier to see it. Additionally quality of life changes could be of great use to outdated systems such as the enchantment table/anvils. I would also consider granting librarians the ability to trade enchanted books that are on their lecterns. This still ensures players must put work into their progression to at least acquire one copy of an enchantment while reducing monotony in the long term. Biome exclusive trades could still supply value in this method.</p>",

        "body": "<p><strong>Mo' Diamonds Mo' Problems</strong></p>\n<p>The major issue, as others have mentioned, relates to diamonds. In the current iteration of the game diamonds are un-farmable, but if you are willing to put in the time and work you can use armorers to at least eliminate the primary demand source (Armor). In this paradigm diamond mining is required for special blocks, but<strong> it isn't actively required by technical players in the late game solely to be able to have basics like tools and armor. These players represent a very small minority of players. MC is not a competition, balance should not be target top players' play styles but rather all play styles.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>By removing renewable diamond armor/tools, players of all skills levels will now be required to consistently grind for a constantly required resource. What this means practically is players spending more time digging 2x1 holes for diamond rather than pursuing their areas of interest.&nbsp; The \"discounts\" on the armor are irrelevant. They could discount down to 1 diamond per piece; the issue would be the same.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Additionally, what was the purpose of adding Netherite - a rare exploration-only armor - if diamonds are now being transformed into the same thing? It seems there is a perception that diamond is late-game only when in reality it is required for fighting even mid-game enemies (Enderman).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The changes relating to splitting up the trades between different villages is more promising, but I think this will depend a lot on implementation (what trades are where).</p>",

I understand wanting biome-specific trades that reward players for exploring, but I don't think we should be forced into that style of play, travelling potentially thousands of blocks, or transporting Villagers thousands of blocks from multiple places, just to get cheaper Diamond gear, that isn't even renewable any more.</p>\n<p>I would suggest keeping the Enchantments on the armour biome dependent as unique rewards for exploring, and probably make them better than Level 1 Enchantments to make it actually worthwhile. Then, make it so Master level Armorers sell ALL armour pieces, or at least two random ones of the four, so you aren't forced to have Armorers in three different biomes for the full set.</p>\n<p>The aim shouldn't be to force a particular style of play, rather to make multiple playstyles viable. I do worry that these nerfs are a step too far and will make most Villagers completely unviable and not worthwhile. They will just have the effect of discouraging using Villagers at all, rather than giving people the option to have either one central trading hall, or exploring for the unique trades. I do also think the Diamond cost should just be a nominal 1 Diamond per armour piece, with the price variation just coming from the Emerald cost, if the point is just to make them not completely renewable.</p>",

Additional resources would also be really cool to help players find rare biomes such as the Cherry Grove or structures like the Ancient Cities. This may not necessarily be in the form of villager trades though. One of the many things I love about this game is how the developers find creative ways to differentiate systems that have similar purposes with different mechanics.</p>\n<p>- Armorers - I actually quite like a few of the changes here. I think it is fair that some diamonds be required for the armor trade. However, having heard complaints recently in regards to the scarcity of diamonds I would perhaps invest in better ways to come across them. I would say that previously armorers made this acquisition far to quick to make. Additionally I really enjoy the new iron/diamond block trades. I think these are great rewards for late-game villager play and shows a matured understanding of the value recourses relative to each other on Mojang's part. I must say however that not allowing for a full set of diamond armor to be produced in one biome seems needlessly tedious to me and does not fit thematically within the bounds of presumed in world culture like the enchanted books might. Do certain tribes just not know how to make boots out of diamonds even though they can out of iron? Lastly I recommend changing the Curse of Binding to a Curse of Vanishing.</p>",

The new map icons are also a nice touch. I hope to see <strong>more villagers </strong>get a rework.</p>\n<p><em>Armorer</em>:</p>\n<p>The few <strong>biome-specific differences are great </strong>and makes it more worth it to have villages in different biomes. The diamond armor trades have been too good for a while now and I believe it should've been more expensive - adding diamonds to the trade works but it does make diamond armor <strong>non-renewable</strong>. I don't know if Mojang considers challenges like Superflat and Skyblock, but it would make diamond armor, a staple of the game, impossible to get here. Just something to note. I do like that if you have a Taiga Armorer and another Armorer, you can swap out boots or a helmet to effectively save 1 diamond on a chestplate or leggings.</p>\n<p><em>Structure Loot</em>:</p>\n<p>I like that enchanted books can be found from structures as it <strong>encourages exploration </strong>more but I would recommend an <strong>exploration update </strong>that makes looting structures more <strong>dynamic </strong>because looting the same structures over and over for a set of enchanted books will <strong>get stale </strong>really fast. Any way to make looting the same structure different every time would make this a <strong>fun way of getting enchants</strong>. Either that or having librarians trade books you've already found. I've seen this suggested before and it would be easier to implement.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Probably should <strong>limit</strong> all the trades to level II or III<strong> </strong>max to be consistent on that end.</p>\n<p>Another thing I'd suggest would be <strong>swapping</strong> the Power and Unbreaking trades, because I consider the former a pretty OP enchantment at the same level of Sharpness, or even more powerful compared to Unbreaking. We already have to achieve a <strong>Master</strong> librarian in swamps to obtain Mending so it won't make much difference, also ideally the order of non-Master books wouldn't be random, as books such as Infinity or Looting shouldn't be obtainable until <strong>Journeyman</strong> in my opinion.</p>\n<p>As a last thing, considering a lot of enchantments have been <strong>removed</strong> from the pool, how about making enchants for crossbows and fishing rods be obtainable through the <strong>Fisherman </strong>and <strong>Fletcher </strong>depending on the biome?

Whether that be by Llama caravans or improving the awful rail system by increasing speed and chaining minecarts.\n<br />2. Adjust the biome temperature system. Currently, medium temperature biomes are way too common, which makes wandering in one direction looking for a rare biome a massive gamble. (Deserts especially should be more common as the only significant source of sand.)\n<br />3. Remove the \"Too Expensive!\" restriction from anvils. Slowly improving a tool or armor piece by adding small enchantments is not feasible, which means we have a progression spike instead of a curve. We already can't have \"the perfect gear\" due to mutually exclusive enchantments, and that's fine. So I suggest that the more a tool is repaired in an anvil, the less durability gets restored per material. You can delay getting mending for your favorite diamond pick, but only for so long before you have to spend a ton of diamonds to repair it.\n<br />4. There should be a method to change a villager's trades. We shouldn't have to unalive multiple villagers before we get the trade we want.</p>",

The only alternative to villagers for enchantments truly is the enchantment table, which doesn't offers treasure enchantments, does offer curses, and has no way to benefit an enchantment above 3rd level, this method already requires both the gear itself and Lapis which can be difficult to obtain if you are mining for it as well.

The level and work station detriment requires the building of either a dedicated high output XP farm to gain benefit from it, or hours of AFKing at a spawner farm rather than spending time playing the game and exploring as you so wish us to do.

Introduction of these features would warrant the addition of an easier way to transport villagers.</p>\n<p>The rest of the balancing, in concept and execution, is awful. This update makes it way harder to get the enchantments you want, that you could have gotten much more easily before, and then gives you less reward for your work. This makes many people just not use librarians, because not everyone is an SMP youtuber who has unlimited time to play this game and who immediately grinds for the best villager trades upon the start of a new world. Just because they're bored of having that power at their fingertips for each world doesn't mean you should punish all other players who just want to use them to make getting good enchantments a little easier.</p>\n<p>Instead of punishing the behavior you don't want, you should encourage the behavior you do want. Maybe provide more reasons for exploring the world, like getting more unique loot from structures, adding more biomes with special desirable items, or making special structures more common. Rather than cutting down a previous feature just because people were taking advantage of it.</p>",

Trading halls and entrapping villagers became the meta because anvils are so expensive and grindy to work with. I would remove the “too expensive” limit as a start, but also cut back majorly on all of the costs, and make it so that it doesnt matter what order you add enchantments. This would also help with the new librarian trades.</p>\n\n<p>On the villager side of things, “secret trades” aren’t very player friendly since there’s no hints in game to tell the player about them. I think mending should be an award to players who cure zombie villagers instead of being locked behind swamp villagers. Curing a zombie villager is told through the player by both igloos and its advancement, so its friendly to new players.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with others that actually transporting villagers should be improved. I think villagers should automatically ride a player’s tamed llama after reaching a high enough trade level, so that itll appear as the player gaining the villagers trust. After reaching where the player wants the villager to get off the llama, maybe the villager can dismount the llama after it gets leashed to a fence post, or dismount when the player holds an emerald in their hand.</p>\n\n<p>For people who dont want to mess with villagers however, i think mending should be available in enchanting tables as the maximum enchanting option (level 30 with all bookshelves). That way players can choose where to get mendng\n</p>",

However, I think that making certain trades locked to certain biomes is not going to make trading any more fair. I do not want to have to transport villagers hundreds of blocks in the nether just so I can have Thorns III or whatever enchantment I want. Villager transport is one of the most annoying parts of the game if you don't have a huge amount of iron. A good rebalance should make the content of the game more engaging and rewarding, but this rework just would make the whole process more tedious. If you want to make trading harder, perhaps make it so all of the good trades (High-level enchantments, diamond armor) require other items along with emeralds to buy. Maybe with enchantments, you have to provide a rare item along with the book and emeralds. Ex. if i want to buy the aqau affinity enchantment, then along with the emeralds and book required to buy it, I also have to pay with some sponges or something like that. That way I don't have to do the annoying task of transporting villagers, and instead I can explore the world trying to get these items required to get good gear. Also for the cartographer changes maybe make the maps also go to more exciting locations, like maybe pillager outposts or ancient cities or trail ruins or the dessert and jungle templs</p>",

The idea is that the player still has to travel the world finding the trades that they desire but then there would be an easier way to consolidate the villagers together in one area. </p>\n\n<p>After the player has found a trade they desire they could hire the traveling merchant or a new type of villager to “escort” other villagers in a caravan of sorts. The player would set the destination to either another village or a new set location made the players spawn location (bed). If the escort is the merchant then the villagers would arrive via riding in the llamas. If there is a new type of villager they could arrive riding animals that would fit the location they were traveling from (ie camels from desert or horses from plains). </p>\n\n<p>This concept would still force the player to travel the world to find the trades they desire, but wouldn’t force the player to travel the world all over again if they accidentally died and lost all their gear. They could move all the villagers much easier and it would add a fun new mechanic to the game and give the traveling merchant a much needed purpose, because we all know most people just straight up kill the merchant on site and take their leads. Adding this would make keeping the traveling merchant around much more valuable. </p>",

Having level one enchants inflates xp costs too much, rather than flatly increasing the number, I suggest that the level is tied to weather there is a librarian nearby. If there are no librarians the levels will be 1, if there are it would be two, and if the librarian is a master it could be 3. This idea connects your villagers together and promotes developing a village as a whole. I think it would be good if more villagers have relationships like this.

Please take a moment &amp; think about what this means for casual players that want to get protection, mending, silk, and efficiency and looting to SPEED up their progress.  You're litterally telling them that they have to play 7x more to get gear just so they don't die or have their gear break or can mine quicker.  OR ACTUALLY EXPLORE without dying. \n<br /> Furthermore- if you want us to explore stop making things like the sniffer &amp; trail ruins nearly require end game gear to get.  You NEED respiration and aqua infinity to get the sniffer.- wich is honestly for kiddies.‐ so you need top level gear to get essentially a plushie. Burying trail ruins in water and having to dig and chew up shovels and pickaxes for sherds &amp; a couple templates isn't worth it until you get enchantments</p>\n\n<p>Cartographer is genius- of ALL of the biome specific villagers this makes sense.

Swamp-witch hut. Ice-basment igloo.  </p>\n\n<p>Also- there should be some way to find the bazillion hidden chests by water.</p>",

This new system changes villagers from a way to speedrun maxed gear to a cog in a system that allows you to optimise your progression but keeping it balanced and not overarching other aspects of the game.<br><br><br>\n</li>\n<li>The next one i see is New players and Casual players. I would agree this needs communicated better to new players but it always did these changes just add another layer of Deapth to it, but so long as mojan adds a way to communicate this to the player through and achivment or somthing i think its fine. The argument for casual players is odd though, its very double edged some casual players who do multiplayer get demotivated by Experienced players grinding maxed gear in a few hours while other just use it to speed up their progress i think casual players will be fine as this is a fair change and if anything gives them more reasons to do diffrent aspects of the game.</li>\n<li>The Major one i think is transport Villagers are slow to transport and even the fastest methods are expensive this one does need a fix but even if not we still have elytra</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I think most trades should be more likely in specific biomes and offer better deals, but only a few should be actually biome-locked. And still, they shouldn't be specific to one biome, but to multiple (so, for example, mending in swamp, mesa, and mushroom). This would also bring back the benefit to creating a larger village, which is gone with these changes due to a lack of variety in trades.</p>\n<p>- diamond armor could also cost no diamonds in certain biomes where it takes more effort to build a village (mushroom island, the End, the Nether, the Deep Dark)</p>\n<p>- while being able to find a biome is easier now, said biome may still be thousands or tens of thousands of blocks away. Traveling that distance every time you want to make one trade isn't fun, but neither is transporting villagers currently.

The reason that everyone tries to get armorers is that we want to have a renewable source of diamond armor, and to avoid having to dump several diamonds into something we can avoid spending the resources on. And the early game use is already balanced by the difficulty of setting them up in the first place, and making them cost diamonds makes it not really worth setting up armorers in the first place.</p>\n<p>For Cartographers,</p>\n<p>These additions are great, more maps to different structures means more exploring around the world, and more knowledge that these structures exist. We still need maps to pillager outposts, buried ancient cities, etc., but the current additions suffice for now. Another thing that should be added is a way to make sure that you get the map to a new location each time. But these changes should stay.</p>",

You still are pushing exploration over everything else and forcing players to have to go extreme distances with villagers with no reliable way to move them over long distances or forcing them to have multiple bases which they must spend way to much time moving between just for enchants or now for different armor. While the maps are a good addition, if they point to a village or structure closest, this may not be the closest <em>biome</em> you are looking for. The anvil issue is not fixed when it comes to the level cap, so with this update you have to hope you get one of the higher enchanting books proposed to be more common because if you don't you cant get that fully enchanted gear you want. Overall still not impressed with the changes as a more casual player who likes to be in one spot - if I wanted to explore I would, stop trying to force me to just so I can get the gear I want for building.</p>",

Afterwards, however, when the Shulker Shells become renewable, while the item-duplication bug still exists, most of the STD players would like to build a Shulker Shells farm at the cost of time, rather than reproducing them via bugs.</p>\n<p>Therefore, for STD players, they won't mass-product any item by bugs when they can product them via in-game mechanisms, but they would rather do it when mass-product is impossible. If you create a resource that cannot be mass-produced, it will only make players more inclined to take advantage of game vulnerabilities that disrupt the game balance, rather than following the path you have arranged for meaningless exploration actions.</p>\n<p>Unless you have the ability to settle all the existing problems, and ensure that there'll no longer be anything wrong with each update, there is no alternative way to satisty players truly.</p>\n<p>By the way, if there exist any resource can neither be mass-produced nor obtained by bugs, it's quite possible for STD players to regard some \"unreasonable\" methods as something tolerable, such as recording the seed and coordinates in advance, or using some plug-ins to obtain the resource.</p>",

This could be through:&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<strong>Trade</strong> (buying all their items or one specific item),</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Giving a Gift</strong> in the form of food and or emeralds (and when the wandering trade recieves enough gifts it is happy to stay and join your village)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Speciality \"Work\" Station. </strong>This could be some kind of trading station/block which increases the likelihood of wandering traders to spawn and join your village. This could pair nicely with the market square already present in many of the villages already in the game, expanding on this lore/mechanic.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Renaming. </strong>Sounds a little boring by comparison to the others, but renaming is a simle easy option to convert wandering traders to villagers.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I especially like the idea of a work station that attracts wandering traders, this skips the whole pain of transporting villagers long distances, and speeds up the waiting for wandering traders.&nbsp;</p>",

You said this is to make it more fun. What is more fun about adding hours of transporting the already annoying to move villagers and adding travel time when you want specific enchants? The handful of reviews that you idiots wrote yourselves with chat gpt praising this make it painfully obvious that you have never done anything with villagers. Anyone else is just a contrarian that has also not done it themselves bc it is already too much effort for them.

Specifically my twist on it is that if diamonds are going to be a key mechanic in the world then there needs to be a renewable way to obtain them without destroying the natural world. We can already trade in diamonds to get emeralds so why not the reverse or craft able diamonds similar to lab grown diamonds. It need not be cheap or easy, just renewable.</p>\n<p>There’s already an in game precedent for Minecraft being conservation minded by limiting drops from endangered mobs. There’s also the ongoing partnerships with the Nature Conservancy and World that show organizationally Mojang values the natural world.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the exploration side of things, having renewable diamond armor takes some of the sting out of exploration related death by giving you a way to re-gear up before going after your lost gear. If I’ve got to be more cautious with my exploration because I’m using up finite resources, then I’m probably just waiting to get elytra before chasing down biome specific gears and books. That’s seems like that’s the opposite of the intent of these changes. However, if instead I’ve got a mid game objective to build up the resources to “farm” diamonds before exploring so I can have basic diamond gear and then explore to get the specific enchanted gear I want for a dragon fight then that adds that content where it’s needed most. It also rewards exploration without punishing players too much.</p>",

I understand the need to rebalance, but this is not the right way to do it. The biome thing is ok, not the best, but acceptable, but making them only give you a discount on subpar diamond gear means that villagers are far more trouble than they are worth and I'd rather just eat the extra diamonds and craft it myself than get a measly 30% discount on crafting some armor.</p>",

The cartography trade that can link you to other villages is fantastic but my 9 year old, who has been playing for over 2 years, still won't use a treasure map to explore further without the help of others so she doesn't get lost coming home!</p>\n\n<p>*Top tear trades should be good quality equipment (i.e. not level 1 enchantments). Again, this will hurt the younger audience who don't have the patience to sit at an enchanting table grinding enchantments for hours to try to get better amour. At least with the current system they have the chance to get a good piece of amour with a few decent enchantments.</p>\n\n<p>*This whole villager trade rebalance feels like it is designed to make it harder for the experienced players to create the ultimate trading hall. The reality is that it's going to hurt the newer ordience who want to move into an established village and level up a few villagers to get some better equipment. </p>\n\n<p>*Super flat world's MUST have biomes added to them for the community to be able to use the biome specific trades</p>\n\n<p>Thank you for reading this far 😊</p>",

It gives me something to do as I try to automate farms and build a villager trading hall - while also being close enough to my kids to help them if they are trying to explore something nearby. Having to travel around the entire map to find specific zone enchantments or gear from villagers is just not fun. You're making what was a difficult but rewarding activity if you put in the effort into an even worse grind. Overall, the librarian and armorer villagers make me disappointment and less interested in playing the game. I do however like that you are trying to improve the wandering trader and the map smith. Finding particular structures and biomes can be very difficult (bamboo!) so this is quite welcome.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I'm struggling to understand why you want to implement some of these changes.

There is no in game way to purge this data, pc players can download tools but console players cannot trim or edit world files without access to a realm and pc. Things like map walls, exploration maps, maps made in error, treasure maps... all these things add up to inflate world size which causes long term issues with a world. Now, multiply this casual use by a 5-10 person server/realm. Imagine the impact on one that hosts 20-30 players! This is why most Bedrock SMPs already strongly discourage their players from using maps, or even take steps to make them unavailable in game. We need this issue addressed while the cartographer changes are still in experimental stages.&nbsp;<br><br>Players think they want parity with java maps for markers and infinity rooms, but we need it to go deeper than that. We need maps to be created equally so we can all enjoy them without artificially inflating our world size.&nbsp;</p>",

Armour smiths can make tools that could be 1 of trades each day and if not sold they can give it to a villager. all of these new features let villagers breed by themselves this way villagers are more organic and instead of boxes you could build a small village for them to achive the same goal and just mark our zones and houses with the Enchants you need. to sum up my solution let villagers have more options to breed among themselves.<br><br></p>",

Breeding</strong></em></p>\n<p>I would like the idea, that different biomes have different cultures, so that villagers have favourite food sources you need to feed them. Like for example: jungle villagers only accept cookies, snow villagers only fish and so on. But the breeding process should not end up as it is for animals. I don't like the idea to have them on the same level as animals (just right-click and go...). Wouldn't be human. <br>Type of the villager baby should also be inherited from the parents. If they are different, there is a 50/50-chance for the type the kid gets.<br><br><em><strong>2. Transportation</strong></em></p>\n<p>To give the camel (especially in single player) more functionality, we need caravans. I imagine it as it follows:<br>If you have two or more camels, you can tie them in a line using leads. One camel must stay away from the group and the villagers (the one camel you will ride). Villagers have a behaviour with a chance (like 25% or some other chance) to hop on a camel and stay there for as long as the camel is tied to another one. If your camels are full, you get your camel and ride to the rest. One villagers could hop on yours. With a lead, you grab one camel and go. <br>For tying and untying a camel, you need a lead in your hand and therefore right-click to ride it is blocked, as long as you have a lead in your hand. <br><br><em><strong>3. Attraction</strong></em></p>\n<p>Villagers without jobs can be attracted with an emerald in one hand. That would make painfull nudging obsolete and give us some joy.</p>",

        "body": "<p>There are only 3 ways to discount villagers in Minecraft: trading, curing and raids. And while trading and curing are decent ways to discount villagers (trading being really doable and curing, while being much harder, gives permanent discounts), raids are completely left out as a good method of discounts, and i do think that those villager rebalancing experiments are the best opportunity we have to rework raid rewards. So...</p>\n<p>Why are raids left out when thinking about discounting villagers ? Well, because the reward for beating such a tough challenge (Hero of the Village) is only given for <strong>40min</strong>, making the ratio for risk vs reward pretty pitifull. So, here is my humble suggestion to try and rework raids into an acceptable way to discount our villagers:</p>\n<p>For each successfully beaten raid near a village, give every villager in this village a small permanent discount depending on the level of the raid and on how many raids have been beaten near this village, on top of the temporary \"Hero of the Village\" discount (5% permanent discount per Bad Omen/Hero of the Village levels, caped at a maximum of 25%). This way, players may go out of their way to do multiple raids on their village just to be able to permanently discount all their villagers by up to 25%.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Construction of a trading hall cureing all the villagers etc. is still a challenging task for most players with should be rewarding. It’s still more difficult than constructing many types of farms. Finally “ rebalancing” villagers would lead to having to rebalance other aspects of the game as well like sand dupers, with are so easy to set up or shulker farms or mob spawners or enchanting or enderman farms the list could go on and on, basically every farm would then be way to OP cause they are mostly so much easier to set up than a trading hall and with trading nerfed to much it would do the exact opposite of what’s intended.\n<br />and isn’t it supposed to be a relaxed fun experience after all?</p>",

It's a vast improvement on the game.<br><br>In saying all of this, I feel like these changes don't really make sense unless new villages are added to the biomes we don't have them yet, it's a little immersion-breaking to have to build one yourself when none exist in the world.</p>",

My thoughts about my playthrought:<br>1. It take way longer to get a full set of diamond armor: I think that´s good, since 1.14 you just need to max an armorer and get a few emeralds, you could do that in about 1/2-1 hour after finding any village.</p>\n<p>2. It got me thinking about a strategy: a plains and savanna village are close to the spawn, so I got there three pieces of diamond armor: leggings, a cursed heltmet and chestplate. After that I wanted a taiga explorer map to trade the cursed armor pieces, but it didnt work, I think taiga armorer should trade damaged and enchanted armor pieces in their expert level trades.</p>\n<p>3. Inventory space: It was a pain to move with all the necessary resourses from village to village, the boundles helps a lot with the inventory managment in the early game.</p>\n<p>4. Diamonds: When the first snapshot was introduced it came with a buff in the diamonds spawn rate in caves, I feel like it neglets the armorer rebalance, because there are too many diamonds, it´s way easier to just go mining. (got about 30 diamonds in less than 1/2 of an hour without fortune). I think that change has to be reverted.</p>\n<p>5. Villagers transportation: There isn´t a well designed form of fast transportation from far away places for mobs.</p>\n<p>Im liking a lot these changes, keep going and reduce the diamonds spawn rate.</p>",

Mending is too valuable to deliberately pass up and the enchanting table too random to bother with in comparison.</p>\n<p>Wandering trader: I generally like these changes, if the villager changes do go through then giving them trades from specific biomes may help resolve some of the issues.</p>\n<p>Zombie conversion: Mixed feelings on the limits, I would do it because I can, the change just makes trading slower.</p>",

Please ensure that the zombie villagers will have the chance to spawn during the night in swamp and jungle biomes just like everywhere else. Also, I'm hoping that later after the team is done perfecting the trades with the few professions stated they will also expand the others. For example, special trade for fisherman in swamp is lily pad. Or special trades for cleric somewhere would be blaze rod or nether wart. Maybe a farmer special trade saplings from different biomes. Shepards have a new and different banner patterns for each biome.&nbsp; Things like that. That way it encourages us to ensure we expand the villages, so we want every profession and want to build a shop for each. I like that!</p>",

Because this \"rebalancing\" is just a difficulty increase.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Minecraft as a game has always been accessible to everyone because the mechanics are simple to begin with, and then as you get more involved and learn more they build in complexity. These biome changes are too much complexity and it ruins the ease of late stage Minecraft that I believe should be there. A lot of the goals in game become about building farms and other things to gain resources easier so you can continue to make bigger and more impressive things. I dont want to be bogged down mining diamonds every session, or wearing iron armor only. By also limiting access to diamond gear and mending, the only thing this \"balances\" is how much time I put into Minecraft or into literally anything else. If I have to spend 3 hours grinding out resources, that before this patch would only take 1 max. I simply wont play the game anymore.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In my personal belief, needing diamonds for EVERYTHING and villager transport being god awful just makes the game inaccessible and a grind that Id rather not deal with.

Though I do like the idea of having a discount for a less desirable piece of armor, it's something I would never do especially when the cold biome villagers get decent enchants without drawbacks and you can get discounted diamond armor with just taiga villagers (16 diamonds made into boots to be used in the expert trades with at minimum 2 villagers which you only need 3/4 available trades vs 12 diamonds for 2 types of villagers that also won't have both pieces at master. The helmet to boot trade is just garbage in singleplayer unless you raid a treasure bastion with a full durability helmet when you already made one or got two from the bastion AND you don't have diamond boots AND you want to save 4 diamonds for something other than boots. But in multiplayer it's useless because you can just try to sell that helmet to other players or give it to a friend or make a backup set of armor)<br><br>I feel like there is room to add a bit more bloat to villager trades to incorporate some of these ideas for trades while keeping the idea of the change to progression in place.

Reworking a core game mechanic in such a way that makes the game more difficult for players who don't have the kind of free time to spend several hours a week grinding for resources - and that's what it is for a lot of players, it's tedious grinding - so that players who do have the free time to do all of that tedious work feel more validated in the way their play style is a bad move.</p>\n<p>It's contrary to the core idea of a sandbox game to force players to adopt the same style of play despite that style not even being feasible for people who have been playing for years. If restocking my tools and armor suddenly goes from taking me about an hour of gathering resources and using the trade system to ten hours of mining, trading, traveling between villages, gathering exp to combine enchantments, and several other steps I'm sure I haven't even thought of in between, I just won't play, not because I don't want to but because <em>I don't have that kind of time.</em></p>\n<p>Many of us who have been playing for almost a decade do not have that kind of time. This change will result in a lot of casual players losing a mechanic that makes the game playable when time constraints are a serious factor in what you spend your free time doing.</p>",

I typically build a big trading hall, and I would be able to get that again without too much trouble, but it would not be fun. villager breeding is annoying, transporting them through the nether is complicated since riding entities (ie in boats or in minecarts) can't go through portals and the nether is too dangerous for fun fast travel these days. I just sound exhausting rather than fun. My kids (9 and 12) play minecraft everyday, and after these changes I can't imagine them bother with villages at all after these changes. So the change is annoying for me and too much work for kids.</p>\n<p>Comparing the armorer changes with the existing weapon smith and toolsmith, I like these changes a lot more. The only thing I would really like changed would be the savana armorer feels like I'm being punished for setting up my base in the savana, which I did and regretted it.</p>\n<p>Cartographer changes are fantastic. I just wish he could now make it easier to find nether fortresses. My spawn ended up not having any near the 3 villages I found.</p>\n<p>I've read these changes are being made to encourage more early game exploration. I feel like this is misguided. Rather than adding new and interesting experiences the librarian changes are just adding more grindy repetitive tasks. I get the frustration.&nbsp;</p>",

I have seen this with my own kids when we play on a server together.</p>\n<p>Part of the problem is that most of these destinations are one off events rather than quests. Ancient city is just that, it doesn't lead anywhere else. The main quest requires getting ender pearls (there are multiple ways to do this, which is cool), Get blaze powder (finding the blazes can be annoying, but it is doable), find a strong hold and after that multi-step process you can fight the dragon and the reward is absolutely worth it, you get to fly (btw at this point exploring is a lot more fun). The Whither-&gt;Beacon quest is also worth doing. But neither Ancient cities nor lush caves are quests. They are just a place you stumble upon.</p>\n<p>That last point is important. Ancient cities are clearly early game destinations, since the only mob there can always one or two hit you, but depending on your seed, they can been thousands of blocks away. They are an early game destination, but late game difficulty. I also don't trust the chest RNG, since in my world with the most time, I don't have the silence armor trim despite scouring 4 different ancient cities.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you want more early game exploration, make it more fun with fun rewarding activities rather than adding grindy gatekeeping to mending.&nbsp;</p>",

I noticed I could trade with villagers, but didn't bother because I didn't need to.</p>\n<p>1.9 - the combat update! I honestly really like the changes, except for that fact that breaking tools, armor and weapons really suck, because the enchantments are worth getting, mobs are harder to kill and hit harder. Mending was added, and I bred and killed too many villagers until I got the book, so the game would stop being about the constant need to make new tools.</p>\n<p>1.14 - Getting mending doesn't involved a insane breeding mechanic or killing so many villagers.</p>\n<p>Making mending harder to get, won't fix the durability and enchanting balance issues introduced in the combat update.

Perhaps the most obvious solution is just to allow the OP trading system on Peaceful + Easy mode and implement the balanced trading on Normal + Hard mode.</p>\n<p>Normally, that's what difficulty modes are supposed to do. If you enjoy the struggle of challenge and slower progression, Hard mode is for you. If you just want to breeze through bc you enjoy other parts of the game, Easy mode is for you. I think there is room for Hard mode to be more for survival/challenge-seeking players, and Easy mode to be more for casual/adventure players.</p>\n<p>Then we can all truly have the best of both worlds and choose the experience we prefer based on the parts of the survival gameplay we enjoy.</p>\n<p>Another option is to release a whole new \"Adventure\" mode as an alternative to \"Survival\" mode.

        "body": "<p>The librarian and armorer changes are not good. Most of the changes to other professions are alright, such as the cartographer selling more maps, but the librarian changes are very bad. There was nothing wrong with being able to access  any enchantment from any librarian, because the chance of getting the specific enchantment you wanted was so low that you could spend hours re-rolling a trade and not get what you want. It was a gamble. Not only did you have to contend with over 30 enchantments, most of which with multiple levels (about 107 possible books by my count), you also had the chance of just getting a bookshelf trade half the time. So if you wanted any one book, it’s already less than one in one hundred chance just against the other books, but with the possibility of a bookshelf it’s now less than a one in two hundred chance of getting the trade you wanted. Most players don’t have the time or patience to do that, so I think it’s unfair to change to a biome based system that won’t even allow you to get the max level books. It’s already difficult to fully enchant boots if you start with maximum books, but now you won’t even be able to start so easy. The current combining enchantment level system makes the process impossible if you do it wrong and it gets “Too Expensive!”. There are lots of over powered farms that can earn you hundreds of levels in relatively short time. These changes are really limiting and unfair to players who put in so much time into this game.</p>",

It was a grind and a gamble that I and many other players have spent hours on. I once spent half a day trying to get efficiency V. And making the books only available at less than max level is salt in the wound when you can mess up enchanting a pair of boots so easily if you’re using books and an anvil. The max enchantment level would need to be reworked.</p>\n\n<p>The armorer not selling renewable diamond armor is limiting. If you want to make it more balanced, just make it more expensive and not come with enchantments.</p>\n\n<p>Cartographers selling more maps is great, I often find it difficult to locate new content when it’s added, so this makes it much easier and saves lots of time.</p>\n\n<p>Biome based trades are terrible.

I like doing things with villagers at the moment. I don't think they're overpowered as it takes a long time to get it all sorted and by then its late game where you need this stuff. Why should I now have to spend much much longer trying to get my weapons and armour back when I have died flying into lava or the void. Villagers are annoying and frustrating enough, having to move them across the world is another problem on its own that would take ages to plan out, do, and then sort out all the problems that will occur. Building trading halls and breeders and searching through villagers until you get what you want already takes a while, can you imagine doing that for every different biome villager type to then have to transport them back. I already don't use netherite, now I would be stuck on iron tools and armour poorly enchanted from not enough levels use of the enchanting table.<br>If this gets implemented, I will probably use a datapack, mods or play on an older version of Minecraft to avoid this change (I already find it hard to play 1.18, as they made mining incredibly annoying in that update throughout the game from beginning to late game).</p>",

It's not really something that needed to be fixed. No one is forced to build one. I don't see why this is even a problem. We had 10 people on our server at it's height, only 2 of us were willing to build trading halls and only 1 of us had time to build a full librarian hall. That's with the old mechanics. Now I guarantee no one will want to build a trading hall. This is a great game but without maxed trading halls I'm not really interested in playing any more. I can barely find the time to build the things I want to build now everything will absolutely take way longer. I already don't want to start a new world because building new trading halls is hard enough as is. If these changes are made I don't think I'll ever want to play again. Not trying to be dramatic that's just how I feel about it. Villager trading is what got me interested in this game and if anything it needed to be made easier and less frustrating to build trading halls. It also makes dying that much more stressful if you lose your stuff. WAY harder to replace max gear. I mean you're basically forcing me to cheat or stop playing the game. Because I'm not going to enjoy playing with half enchants and this difficult a process for trading halls. Basically this only makes sense for very large servers with huge amounts of people to spread the work. Everyone else is left out to dry.</p>",

If a rebalance is implemented as described above, it will make village trading tedious to the point of frustration for players. Villager trades - and yes I am mostly talking about the massive nerf on librarians - are fairly easy at the moment, but this type of rebalance will take them from easy to far too difficult and demanding. If you really want to nerf villagers, just get rid of the stick trade! Yes, there is probably a solution. But I don't believe this is it. (I also don't think villager trading should be a developmental priority at the moment, when there is so much potential elsewhere)&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A suggestion I have would be to eliminate the biome-dependent aspect and just have different types of librarians (i.e. one type of librarian specializes in a given \"category\" of enchantments OR have certain other villagers (i.e. smiths, fletchers, and armorers) offer enchanted books as well. I do think integrating the enchantments offered into the villager rank system is a great idea, so that players have to put in a bit of work to obtain high level enchantments such as mending, unbreaking III, efficiency V, etc. Maybe there is a chance that even a master rank librarian doesn't offer the enchantment the player wants. Nerfing the zombification/curing discount mechanic isn't a bad idea either</p>",

The idea of only Master level librarians giving certain trades is neat. However, as with the Librarian trade changes, the Cartographer also has some issues. If you are making certain trades biome specific, and are trying to get players to stop grinding for certain trades, perhaps villages should be added to all biomes that have trade possibilities. In that, rather than players grinding for Mending or whatever, they would actually have an interest in going to and exploring those biomes to find villages.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I understand that the Swamp might not have a village due to Witch Hut's spawning, but there is no real in-game reason to have a lack of Jungle villages. Either way, if the issue is with players grinding to get certain villagers, then perhaps you should negate that by adding villages to those biomes. As it is looking right now, if someone is a casual player, looking to get a certain enchantment, then they have to wander far to get that, more so if they have Large Biomes enabled.</p>\n<p>(also the new maps for Cartographer sound super cool)</p>",

I understand that this is a way to encourage players to explore their world more,  but I must argue that instead of achieving its intended purpose, this rework will instead be a major inconvenience. \n<br />The latest few updates have been introducing new sites for us players to explore, and I certainly appreciate these features. However, I am only looting and exploring these structures because I want to (as each of them provide exciting challenges that I must face), not be because I need to (as getting a specific enchantment in a specific structure). That is what makes exploring these structures so fun. If the alternative method of consistently getting good enchantments becomes constantly looting structures, then the experience would quickly turn to a grind. Not fun.  \n<br />I think the way librarian villagers work now is perfectly balanced. A player must invest time to first build a villager trading structure, then find a librarian that sells good enchantments, and lastly pay a generous sum to get good enchantments. The efforts invested in building the base and making that money IS worth a consistent income of good enchantments. If you really want to “rebalance” librarians, just increase their prices; don’t make the villagers completely useless, and us players who just want to build a nice base and relax frustrated. </p>",

I also think the diamonds and emeralds to diamond armour is too harsh, because not getting diamonds is the whole reason why people want to trade with certain villagers for tools and armour. And the whole zombification thing getting nerfed is just rubbish in general, due to people needing gapples and weakness pots to cure them in the first place, but you would need LOADS of them to cure and recure multiple villagers for a full on trading hall. Of course we have emerald farms, but for those players who don’t know of them or don’t have the materials, it would be better to just cure villagers for better deals. Please take this into consideration on your recent “rebalancing”, and just know I am a Minecrafter through and through, but I can’t really get materials, so as a YouTuber, it would be even more embarrassing to not be able to do what I want with villagers.

As requested and also proposed by many players (with more upvotes than the original POST by the way) is that, its already a pain in order to get all the villagers required for all your trades, and in the endgame, someone should just be able to have a renewable source of *everything* somewhere. Like the cartographer changes are absolutely fine, but the armorer changes AND the librarian changes are a terrible idea, and a huge step back.</p>\n\n<p>As already mentioned by a lot of the players, diamonds are not renewable, emeralds are, and this was just a QOL feature that everyone loved. Removing this AND also making it biome specific just makes it THAT much harder to just... have some fun? Its a sandbox game after all, and having fun exploring is the exact opposite of being forced to explore because ur armor's just gonna break after a little bit and ur gonna need to either get insane numbers of mending books just by travelling. Not fair. Please dont add these.</p>\n\n<p>The librarian changes are also BRUTAL. Like, come on. What do u want us to do, go to every single biome, collect every single villager just to get some insanely bad final trades, and you cant even breed them at home and get those trades to be renewed. Man, i cant express how much this update would suck, because its already such a pain, and its being made more of a pain. Please remove this.</p>",

Therefore, players will either collect spare diamonds or collect new ones when they lose them. This is mostly stressful and painful for the players, and they may quit the game because of this. Also, the primary method of obtaining diamonds is underground mining, not caving. Exploration gives the player a thrill and excitement the first time, but after the second time, it becomes nothing more than a simple movement and work. Increasing the amount of diamonds demanded is not desirable, as it increases this tedious and painful time. And the means by which these tedious hours can be largely eliminated should be trading.<br>I think a way to make it more difficult to get diamond armor in the early stages and less difficult to get armor later on is to increase the difficulty of leveling up to mastery (increase experience or make the first half of the transaction more difficult) and make trading for diamond armor emeralds only.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Villagers give you full diamond armor and tools and no need for a enchantment table so the first thing players would use them for is pointless now too. The diamond stuff wasn't as much of a problem at first because they would come with enchantments but when the grind stone was added that changed. If netherite armor and tools were sold then mojang went to remove them players would complain. they now need to go to the nether?!!?, and find a bastion?!!?! \"players don't have time to grind\". There is creative mode if you don't want to gather resources. Its called a game for a reason there's supposed to be progression not villagers now I have everything.</p>\n<p>Other areas. with so many blocks and items available from villagers it was absurd to cure villagers over and over and get everything for 1 emerald which you got from selling 1 carrot.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I still think the biome thing isn't enough and mending shouldn't be a trade offer.</p>",

But there needs to be a better and more accesible way to create new villages, in order to get certain items and enchantments in specific biomes. And I've come up with what i think is a good way to do this. Once you decide where you want to start your new village you have to occupy this area for a while. Once you've been there enough time for the wandering trader to spawn, you can build an extra house with a bed for the trader to stay. Once the trader has been there for a while and has used the bed enough times, then (if you build more houses with beds) new villagers start spawning in the area just like the wandering trader (but these will be regular villagers, but still will spawn with the same chance as the wandering trader). they can then occupy the other houses with beds, and voila new village has been created. I feel like this is an interesting concept, so feel free to use this idea.</p>",

There is also no point in having this enchantment if you play alone. Using experiments, I traded with a Savanna Villager. Its level 1 trade was Curse of Binding. So was its level 3 trade but it was more expensive. I don’t know if this has been resolved but, if it hasn’t, what is the point?</p>\n<p>I also think that Cartographers should trade maps that take you to Mushroom Islands. The last Mushroom Island I saw was… I can’t even remember. It’s as if they were removed from the game! It would be great if these biomes were easier to find. It would also be great if all the explorer maps had coordinates in the top corner of them, indicating how far you have to go, then you can work out the best way to get to the destination on the map.</p>\n<p>I would also like to mention that Village distribution and Villager AI really need changing. We have all found Villages that have appeared on the top and the side of mountains. Villagers can’t get to the areas they want to as a result. If they fall into another area, they get stuck. <br>I think that Villages should never be disturbed in this way. Put the Village on top or the bottom of the mountain, not in between. If a Villager can’t get to the work station, they shouldn’t connect to it in the first place. <br>Also, add Swamp and Jungle Villages</p>",

Players want to see new game content, not artificially prolonging existing content; it's simply wasting players' time.

This would help with both establishing new villages and just general exploration, and avoid skipping over closer biomes in order for the map to find a structure.</p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Rework the Anvil</strong>. Make it so that you can use either experience or resources to fix your gear. Then, remove the \"Too Expensive\" tag from the anvil, let the player decide if it's too expensive to repair.</p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Rework the Enchanting Table, give more use to amethyst,</strong> so that using Amethyst Crystals in the enchanting table, instead of lapis, would allow you to upgrade the level of one of the existing enchantments on an item.</p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Give Superflat an Exception.</strong> Some players play superflat. Superflat should just keep the original villager trades.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>Include new exclusive Biome Trades.&nbsp;</strong>Just as an example, Blue Ice, it would sell for less in snowy biomes and for more in deserts, just to give an example.</p>\n<p>7.&nbsp;<strong>Fix Villager Biome types</strong>. If a villager's job block is in a biome, that is the villager's biome.</p>\n<p>8. <strong>Make it a Gamerule</strong>. There are so many opportunities that gamerules have to adjust the difficulty of a world.

However, having lost my very hard won enchanted armour in a trial chamber, I'm really frustrated. I have spent too long back at the spider farm trying to get silk touch from the enchanting table. I just need a turtle egg to make a gold farm to get exp. A change of tactics makes me think early game gold/enderman farms will become the goal. If these changes get added could I suggest that the level of enchantment you can get is improved - so that you only have to combine once at least. It seems mean after all that work to have to combine 3/4 times. The new armorers just seem pointless - buying a chest plate for a pair of boots? Why would I? However I haven't really tried those yet due to having to go back to base to get the basic enchants again. I get some of the ideas being trialled here, like different librarians in different biomes and haven't given up. But right now I'm fed up. If this becomes the game it will really be necessary to make the enchanting table a bit less frustrating. I don't mind mining for diamonds and like the greater ease of getting them now, but the enchanting side is holding up my game. I want to get back to the trial chamber which I love!&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>Changes in play that I'm noticing after some hours in the new system.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) More rather than less use of chunkbase over adventuring. My travelling is needed for the purpose of finding/creating and trading with librarians, and as that will take long enough, I want to spend less time wandering the world looking for the biome I need with a village nearby. This is a loss as I love aimless adventuring.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2) Moving faster to the end, or to gold farming - even though my equipment isn't really ready, to create an exp farm to see if I can manage with enchantments rather than books.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>3) some relief that I can only cure villagers once. The prices I got for my mending books were fine, and not having the complexity of re-infecting them meant I could introduce one zombie, let it do its work, kill it, cure the villagers and move on. I like this.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>4) Near game quitting frustration when I lost my first load of enchanted gear having ground out the levels at a spider spawner. Going back to that endless search for the enchants I need (just silk touch right now) is horrible. I'm off to find a snow biome to try that way.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5) The wandering trader change is great - especially for that very early game. So cool to welcome him and actually trade, rather than just relieving him of his leads because I have no emeralds yet.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Also, now that you have nerfed the zombification and curing mechanism, I am generally trading a lot less with villagers overall: It does not provide very much experience for the effort. I think you will find that players will interact with villagers a lot less, aside from their role as a source of iron golems as a result of this effort. My biggest complaint is that this complex system, with a lot of consideration, will result in a mechanic that is going to be under utilized due to the lack of reward. If that is your aim, then I think you should continue. I generally dislike the changes that have already been made.</p>\n<p>If you are open to ideas, and want to make diamonds contingent upon opening up other trades, then consider making one of the armorer trade tiers *only* diamond, and subsequent tiers cannot be unlocked unless that diamond trade is satisfied yet do not require diamonds to pay for the trade. I think that would satisfy superflat players as they still do have access to scant diamonds, and it wouldn’t require casual players to slog through mining for many, many diamonds for middling results.</p>",

The fact that in a sandbox I would be forced to go out and find villagers thousands of blocks away from my home just to find a singular trade I need and if I wanted to have easy access to this trade travel thousands of miles back. Now as for the Armorer he was a very useful reusable source of diamons for late game players who will need fresh sets of armour if anything goes wrong, forcing an endgame player who has likely torn through the caves of their world travel thousands of blocks to repeat progress lost is a uneeded and painful task. As for structure loot I think the changes are great as exploring a dangerous or rare area should be rewarded fairly maybe even adding unique enchants to help with exploration of areas like it.</p>",

If I want a set of fully enchanted armor, I just don't see the villagers as a means of getting it, especially with the cumulative cost &amp; level cap when using an anvil to merge/level up enchantments.</p>\n<p>In the current setup, building a villager trading hall is extremely tedious, but at least it's possible. I appreciate that the rebalance is trying to replace that with a fun/interesting alternative to that. In principle, I like that it incentivizes exploration over breaking &amp; replacing lecterns for hours. But as it currently stands, the rebalance doesn't offer a full replacement for trading halls.</p>\n<p>Master level villagers only give level 1 protection armor? Not to mention I have to upgrade the armorer fully before even finding out if it trades the particular piece of armor I'm looking for. No villagers trade unbreaking diamond armor? Additionally, what's the info for toolsmiths and weaponsmiths? Are those equally limited?</p>\n<p>On the plus side, I do like the structure loot changes.</p>\n<p>Overall, I love this idea, and I feel like it's aimed in a general direction that makes sense and is a huge improvement over hacky trading halls and painstakingly transporting villagers around... but it still falls short, I think.</p>",

Perhaps if the player's popularity dropped low enough, they would display the poisonous potatoes, or perhaps toss the item at the ground in the direction of the player if one were to attempt interaction? I think it would be pretty funny to see them toss a rotten potato (the item, not as a projectile) at you as a sign of their disapproval and annoyance at your presence.

I had to build a grinder just to get a zombie villager to spawn so I could cure it - and I had to battle creepers, spiders, and blazes just to make the potion I needed (not to mention all the gold I had to find for the Golden apples!) because my world was empty. It worked, but nice witches would have made populating a village so much easier!</p>",

But I think it would be really nice to introduce friendly witches and hostile witches, as the idea of covens could be really cool to see in the game, where perhaps brewing could become a bigger element in the game and explained a little more? The standard witch hut doesn't need any tampering with imo, but it could be exciting to see little witch communties (of either hostile or neutral witches) that would be parallel to regular villages, but more fantastical, maybe in more quirky places like at the tops of cliffs, floating islands, underwater, in mushroom biomes, farlands, or maybe even in the nether? Perhaps interacting with witches could open a trading interface for brewing ingredients, enchanting books, and maybe it could be a trading system that doesn't revolve around emeralds, the way bartering with piglins has become an alternative system. Maybe placing something in a witch's chest would be swapped out for something completely random?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Connecting witches a little more to villagers sounds like a good idea to me, at least the story about them. Illagers and villagers go hand in hand, but witches feel like an odd, kind of neglected third wheel that could use a little more fleshing out? Maybe I rambled a little bit here, but I would just love to see witches get some more love and become a bigger thing in game!</p>",

I know it is frequently requested (on reddit at least), but frankly I don't think it would fit the game.</p>\n<p>Actually, I was thinking that when illusuioners disguise themselves as villagers, it is usually to hide in the mansion's jail cells...&nbsp; That or they would be disguised as some sort of travelling merchant villager, like the sort found in this idea currently under review:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360012407212-Adventurous-Villager-Red-robed-\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360012407212-Adventurous-Villager-Red-robed-</a></p>\n<p>&gt;I love the role of illusioners as spies, it just fits their magic, but I think a better way of incorporating them into villages could and should be found.</p>\n<p>The idea of illusioners showing up in villages proper was not part of my original idea, but if this can work, then so be it.</p>",

But I do feel they should really keep the bow and arrows, throwing knives are edgy and feel a bit forced here. However make it so that they shoot spectral arrows instead of normal ones, mostly to continue the idea of a \"magic spy\" by making it so hostile mobs can track the player more easily. Also their maximum health does need to be lowered, but I'm thinking more around 22 or 18 hit points instead of 24. And perhaps for a unique drop they could yield a new type of totem, the \"illusion totem\" that summons in 4 silhouettes of the player upon consumption to confuse attacking monsters.</p>",

You'll gain the blindness effect (which sometimes happens when fighting them atm) and they will summon clones in a circle around you, one of them being real. Each hit you deal to them should change the way they clone themselves, from a circle, to a group as it currently is, etc. They should also have a spectral effect whenever they go invisible, or possibly just not go invisible at all so they are more about blending in with the illusions. The illusions should also have collision since in the current version they just float all around the place and it looks incomplete.</p>",
