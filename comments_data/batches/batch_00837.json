I don't agree at all about the excitement of finding Diamonds being hurt by finding less per vein; they're still just as rewarding to find. Smaller veins also force you to interact more with the game, IMO. Previously, progression would spike sporradically, and it was way easier to call it quits when exploring a cavern because you had gotten what you needed. Building mining infrastructure and strips will be a lot more interesting in the update than prior, too, especially with underground builds and biomes!</p>\n<p>The only reason we might feel a bit let down <em>now</em> is because we still have that learned experience of there being a bunch per vein. We expect more right now, but that expectation will be unlearned with time. In the long run, the 21w11a approach will be beneficial.</p>\n<p>I could potentially see bigger veins appearing VERY rarely in the Deep Dark, or low underground below Y = -32, but there really shouldn't be more Diamond than there is now. It's only useful for progression and should be limited as such.</p>",

As of 21w13a, Diamond Ore blobs attempt to generate in 2 batches. One batch attempts to generate 6 times per chunk with 0-5 Diamond Ores (50% reduced air exposure). Now here comes the fun bit. The second batch attempts to generate <strong>1/9</strong> times per chunk with <strong>0-23 Diamond Ores!!!&nbsp;</strong>(70% reduced air exposure). The developers just are absolutely rocking it with ore generation. I hope this absolutely clears any complaints. Diamonds have been absolutely de-valued since the Middle Ages of Minecraft, so they might as well make mining the most amusing and fun way to do it, as well as very efficient (just imagine the jackpot you can find if you keep exploring!). They are still quite rare, but with how the game has evolved, they definitely shouldn't be as scarce underground, otherwise why mine for them?</p>",
