Have it also apply to tamed cats. It would be better than having them just sit in my house or in just one spot. I do like the difference crafting for the collars however it would be a lot of work since it would need to spawn a tamed wolf with a “follow” collar and would also include the need for a crafting recipe to be made to dye each collar variant to each color variant as well as create textures for all of the items that would be created. A different way to implement this mechanic could be an item like a name tag. Have a UI for the dog/cat and have a slot for a name tag. Have a bar in the UI, next to the tag slot, that displays the current mode the pet is in. When clicked, it would change modes. There could also be a bar like this for setting the “wander” radius. I like the wander radius being set to where the collar is crafted/put on(or in the case of the tag UI, mode activated), but if the need for a different anchor method was to come up, maybe a food bowl as an anchor point. The bowl item could also have food put it in for the pet(s) that are set to wander/guard if they happen to take damage. I really do like the concept of having more for our pets to do. And for house with indoor and outdoor spaces, instead of making it so tamed pets could open full size doors, why not make it so tamed pets could open trapdoors? </p>",

Also it might run up to you when you come back to your base and make it feel more lively.

I spawn next to a taiga and a snowy mountains biome and I haven't found a single warm biome. I've gotten lost like 10 times just for a single cactus and at this point. Also, the minecraft wiki says \"Sea pickle colonies generate on the bottom of WARM oceans and are found on top of coral blocks in coral reefs.\" on the page for sea pickels, so to get a popular dye you need a warm biome... where it logically could just be obtained by breeding sheep.<br><strong>How you could do it: </strong> Just like other sheep breeding in Java, you could add this to the list of combos. Also maybe add this feature to bedrock.</p>",

The benefit of having one is possible to stop endermen from attacking you when you're within a certain block range of the cat, the cat can give you temporary night vision within range, the cat can grow into a big cat (like a panther) for you to mount and ride, or maybe it can be the only cat that will attack for you. They could be tamed via raw fish covered in chorus fruit juice. Or maybe, the endermen could be afraid of these cats as they eat some type of fish coated with the juices of ender eyes. But that may be morbid? I don't know.<br><br>I think a hell hound would be much cooler than a cat for the nether. They could give you fire resistance when in range, maybe lead you towards the nearest nether fortress, morph into a larger hell hound for you to mount and ride, will deal fire damage when it attacks mobs (straight-up burning hostiles and immediately cooking passives), can swim through lava with no problems, or will be the only pet mob that can serve as a traveling light source (as in it can light up the area surrounding it almost like a torch but not really), They could be tamed with bones sprinkled with blaze powder.

Also, I think you should do that because then you can use the firefly jars as light sources, maybe even the first or only light sources you can hold in your hand and still use, and you could have the fireflies as pets, anyways I also think this should be the case because fireflies have had a long history in MC mods so they should be added in my opinion</p>",
