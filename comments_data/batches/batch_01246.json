Also this merchant can add enchantment slots by adding that you have on your weapons that you don't use but it will caust 2 enchantment points and 500 emeralds. Also this merchant can add up to 4 enchantment slots (Because every weapons starts with one enchantment slot so 1+4=5) And to get those slots go to Apocalypse +21 to get 4 slots and Apocalypse +42 to get 5 slots (Pls Mojang add Apocalypse +26 to Apocalypse +50)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I was not reading about the game, I was just waiting for it to be released.

The next dlc announced 3 new dlc levels and 1 new free level, and we could expect 1 secret level as well (not announced but it would be very weird if they don't do that). We could expect dlc 2 to be the same. So that means the game will become 34 levels long, on par with path of exile 1.0. there's also \"Island realms\", which could be just a map or a new game mode. The first year can get MCD to a point where $30 become well worth it. Remember, it took Minecraft like almost 3 years to get to its first \"complete\" form, that is version 1.7. we definitely can wait. Plus right now it really takes almost 20 hours to find most of the secrets without looking up a walkthrough. </p>",

I am also trying to keep enough gear so I can have a little of everything for Ancient Hunt runes, &amp; it's really hard when there's no rhyme or reason to the sorting. That's a major drag!</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.0pt;\">Here's some ideas, all within the existing gear-type tabbed pages:</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1. Sorting!</span>&nbsp;let me sort items by last equipped (easy way to keep track of important items you wind up using a lot), sort by newest acquired, rarity, power, # of enchantment slots, name, attribute (speed ammo range etc)&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2. Filters!</span> Filter by category (souls yes/no, others?), available enchantments, Ancient Hunt runes</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">3. Favorites!&nbsp;</span>Prevent deletion, pin items. Dare I suggest gear sets?</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.0pt;\"><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">4. Visibility:</span>&nbsp;somehow inspect enchant options for an enchanted gear without removing the enchants at the Blacksmith, toggle Ancient Hunt rune visibility</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.0pt;\">In summary, we now have a 300 item inventory &amp; we are now saving gear for Ancient Hunts we wouldn't have otherwise makes inventory management more important than ever! Even \"just\" the ability to sort by last equipped, by name, &amp; time acquired would be such a quality of life improvement.</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.0pt;\">TL;DR I shouldn't have to spend that much time looking for a specific item &amp; filters/sorts would help out a lot!</p>\n<p style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 11.0pt;\">Thanks for a great game!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

That way you don't need as much Cooldown reduction. And if the cooldown is lower then you can use flaming quiver and fireworks arrow more often which is easier on arrows comsuption considering these skill don't use the \"arrow count\". Also Infinity enchant affect these skill which helps a lot too.</p>\n<p>Torment quiver is diffrent because you mostly need a melee weapon to regain souls. Infinity enchant isn't even needed unless (maybe) if you can't gain souls fast enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you go for an hybrid build, in general&nbsp; Infinity enchant will be 95% of the time more than enough. That said I dunno if by design the devs expect people to use a bit of melee and a bit of ranged attacks.</p>\n<p>As it been said ranged can be really powerfull, 100% cooldown reduction + firecracker skill and a multishot crossbow (Harp)&nbsp; and you are good to go. It's powerfull to the point where you wonder if that should exist.</p>\n<p>And from what i've seen Torment Quiver is really good too just look for \"Minecraft Dungeon OP Cleave Build Showcase\" on youtube. The build could be more powerfull with a good Splending Robe (+50% artifact damage) but his build is nicely done.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
