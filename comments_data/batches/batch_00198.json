At that time, countless Withers existed — and even giant versions of them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This past could be reflected in a new biome: the Wither Biome, a gray, infected area with black particles, an ash-covered sky, and a horizon that is hard to see. The grass of the biome would be black, reinforcing the dark and dead atmosphere of the place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The ground would feature Wither flowers and “dead” black saplings. Fossils of giant Withers would be scattered all over. These fossils are made of a new block: Wither Bone, similar to Bone Block but black. Wither Skeletons could drop this bone in addition to coal. The biome would be flat, filled with craters from explosions, usually appearing in plains, near oak forests, or at the base of mountains.</p>",

And that overhaul goes perfectly with the Hosts of Minecraft Legends. Here is the tale:</p>\n<p><strong>Before the beginning, when no mob had walked the Overworld, nor any player entered the world, there were the Hosts. Four of them, who ruled over infinite realities--formed by imagination and creativity. They were Knowledge, Action, Foresight, and Chaos--the strongest of them before the first world. But when the other Hosts gathered to create the first world, Chaos fought them. He sought to keep their creation in his control--forever. So, as the Hosts were creating their world, he used all his power to shatter it into a thousand pieces, leaving all the villagers who had been made to decay into what we know as the Endermen. And Chaos? He was banished into the result his own destruction--cast down by the united power of the Hosts. And in this void, the Hosts set in place a dragon whose soul would bind Chaos in the dark. And Chaos? He created, twisted, and shattered everything he could in his confinement, knowing that one day, an unsuspecting hero would wander into his grasp--a vessel to take ahold of. To End.</strong></p>\n<p>Chaos appears as a boss, spawnable in a temple that appears in the Isles. When defeated, he escapes through a portal so that the player cannot slay him in his weakened state. But with every battle, he grows much stronger. However, it's worth it for the drops he gives every time he's beat.</p>",
