So they could have more health, do more damage and be much rarer, maybe only spawning once or twice per Bastion. They would carry gold swords (enchanted 100% of the time), and shields, being the first mob to do so. Their attack AI could be that they’d hold up their shield, making them temporarily invulnerable to sword damage, and attack with their sword once or twice. Afterwards, they’ll disable their shield and strafe around the player, giving them a chance to attack. Alternating between these two phases, with a random time interval between blocking and strafing, would make fighting a Piglin Warlord much more challenging than a regular Piglin, but not a boss.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Besides that, they would act much like regular Piglins, attacking players for stealing or for not wearing gold armour. However, perhaps their player-detection range could be much higher, so it would be harder to steal from them if that's what the player wants to do.</span></p>",
