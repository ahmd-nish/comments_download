It will be the size of an iron golem, and have an iron axe to use as a weapon. With every strike of the Minotaur, it will do 10 damage (5 hearts), but will be very slow. The Minotaur will also have another attacking move, where he tries to ram the player with its head, which will do 5 damage, and could break specific blocks like the ravager. The minotaur will also have 100 HP. When dead, it will drop 0-4 leather and 0-2 Minotaur horns. You can use one Minotaur horn, a stick, and a feather to craft 8 Minotaur Arrows, which will work like regular arrows, but can break and go through the blocks that Minotaurs and ravagers can destroy, like wood.</p>",
