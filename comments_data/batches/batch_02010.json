I play on Windows 10 edition with my friends and literally, this happens so many times, I've been hit so many times by mobs while typing, and I have lost hundreds of chat messages because your chat closes when you take damage. This is really getting on my nerves since Windows 10 edition is on PC, and Java is also on PC, so why does Java not have that absurd feature, but Windows 10 does. There should at least be an option to toggle that on or off incase if some people, such as mobile players, would like to keep it on. You don't know how frustrated I am right now, and my friends have also gotten disturbed with this same issue. But anyways, I hope people see this suggestion and help us out. Thanks for your patience.</p>",

But what if this could actually help with Gameplay...</p>\n<p>This will all have to be optionable of course, but what if you could make the Controller vibrate whenever you are hit with a bow shot, or whenever you are hit by Melee. This could actually be useful as sometimes (On Servers Mostly), I am being chased and I want to know if they landed a hit with a sword or a bow without changing Perspectives. I'm kinda disappointed that Minecraft hasn't implemented Controller Vibration at all.</p>",
