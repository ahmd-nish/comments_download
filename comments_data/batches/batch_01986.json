        "body": "<p>I agree, but I think I should elaborate on why this is important.</p>\n<p>Minecraft is a fantastic resource for language learning, since it gives you a ton of exposure to vocabulary. However Japanese is a very difficult language to learn, partially because of its three writing systems: hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Hiragana and katakana are not very difficult because each character stands for a specific sound. Kanji are the issue because instead of standing for a specific sound they stand for a specific meaning, so you have a kanji for water, fire, axe, decision, etc. Because of this a single kanji can have multiple readings, kind of like how the character 2 is read differently than the same character in the word 2nd. Unless you know the word or kanji, you don't know how to pronounce it/read it. </p>\n<p>For example, if I wanted to learn the word for axe (<span class=\"text\">斧</span>, read <span class=\"furigana\"><span class=\"kanji-2-up kanji\">おの</span></span>), you'd have to pick up a dictionary or kanji lookup tool instead of just reading the name. Looking up kanji takes time, which takes you out of the game. </p>\n<p>Furigana is a way of solving this problem. Basically, furigana places the hiragana reading of a kanji above the kanji itself. This allows people who don't know the kanji to read it correctly. Now instead of having to look up the reading, the reading is right there.</p>\n<p>By adding furigana, you'd be making the game more accessible to language learners and young Japanese people by making the game easier to read.</p>",

For instance, if players are on a medieval roleplay server, but they cannot say the word \"Knight\" because it contains 3 unacceptable letters, this greatly damages the quality of the game. Ultimately, having this enabled by default restricts every community of minecrafters, and will kill the game's popularity. Microsoft is getting to be too heavy handed with their game, as they have with other games, which will lead to suffering sales and returning users, smothering the once vibrant and vital flame of the community, leaving only a wisp of smoke as the last few users simply put up with the changes and allow themselves to be controlled.</p>",

Not only for the reasons you listed but so many more!&nbsp;<br>I used to work security for the government, for example, and A LOT of kids play minecraft. It would be great for them (or their parents) to be able to set a basic, nondescript, type of skin so that if they play online they don't feel the need to talk about, or discuss their gender, or be mis-cast. For example: A young girl who is either fully feminine/female, or too young to know/care about such things often has the choice of either; Picking the girl skin, because she is a girl, and does NOT want to walk around with a boy skin, but then has to constantly hear stuff about her being a girl, or Pick the boy skin. And just pretend to be a boy.</p>\n<p>(This is but one of several examples that instantly came to mind when I read your suggestion, I decided to list it specifically because of it's security and children safety issues. But there are so many more! Good job.&nbsp;<em>~upvoted~)</em>&nbsp;</p>",

This would improve combat in mobile allowing players to not be stuck behind the shield when in combat. \n<br />Example: a skeleton fire an arrow. Because of the delay tap, the player depending on the distance would be struck by the arrow or be able to block it. The closer they are to the skeleton the less time they have to block. They would need to be extremely quick at tapping to block that arrow. With the option to hold instead, they would only need to press it down once, they be free to attack afterwards without the mobility plenty of having the shield up (again because of the two pat delay.)\n<br />Minecraft kept the option to allow players to switch the crouch with the jump to the old controls. This I find to be great for strafing.\n<br />If holding the crouch is going to be a problem. They always can have it so if you tap twice, it would remain the same automatic hold down crouch, but when you need to block at least, you can hold down the button.\n<br />This movement that can allow someone in PVP or PVE on mobile to be close enough in to compete with someone on console or PC. \n<br />Also I would like a old feature back which is pointless allowing mobile players to swing their fist, tools and weapon around. The pc and console player can do it, why not mobile?</p>",

I'm sure many people use the shield whiles its blocking an attack so that would be even more stressful. And for console, I am a sort of player who always has my shield in my offhand, so having to take my shield off my offhand just to place or use a block is already more stressful then having to crouch. I like your idea and where your coming from though, but the alternative options aren't the best.</p>",
