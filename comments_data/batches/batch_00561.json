I always go online looking for information on which mobs drop what it'd be great if it said like drops 1 gunpowder with 22% of happening. All the info it could hold would be great cause Minecraft itself sometimes just doesn't explain anything to the player themselves. How to craft or what certain item even do to begin with lol, like I said td be great to have just info Right there while your playing.</p>",
