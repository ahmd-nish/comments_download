But it has a detailed ecosystem in itself, more detailed in fact than most (or all) other biomes. This biome has trees that summon a Creaking (which I assume is an extension of the tree), the Creaking interacts with its tree, sending and receiving signals from the heart (that's the particle effect). The heart is made of resin, and when it receives strange signals from the Creaking (e.i., the player hits the Creaking), it grows more resin as if trying to reproduce itself in case of death (its not vary successful as the player takes the resin but whatever). Then there's the eyeblossoms, which communicate with each other, encouraging each other to open up. And of course lets not forget that day time mobs can't spawn in there, hinting at its hostility, the eyeblossoms poison bees so its safe too assume that the reason normal mobs don't spawn there is because the grass and moss poisoned and killed them. If anything this biome has a huge inner ecosystem compared too other biomes.</p>",
