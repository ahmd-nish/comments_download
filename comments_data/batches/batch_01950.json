When creating a storage room, it's a real pain to manually sort everything each time. While automatic sorting can be set up using redstone, not everyone knows how to use it... It's a shame to miss out on such a feature that would make the game much more enjoyable.<br>So, I vote for this idea and hope to see it implemented soon. Thank you!</p>",

In the beta versions of the game, this file exists fully, (as in, it actually exists in the game) while outside of the beta, the file does nothing, except when you edit it to have custom text, not sure why it only works with that, but after a week of maybe 5 hours total working on the file trying to see where it works, I can conclude that it is probably only implemented in the beta versions. I fully support this motion, if Mojang went through with this, it would be a lot better if there was an option in the \"Video\" settings which says \"Debug Bar\" and it has a button to activate or deactivate it, from there, it can just exist. I am no programmer, but I would love to help with trying to get this done.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Edit: &nbsp;<span title=\"AyhamGamingYT\"><a href=\"/hc/en-us/profiles/385438746651-AyhamGamingYT\" data-bi-name=\"ayhamgamingyt\" data-bi-id=\"n13a3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">AyhamGamingYT</a>&nbsp;mentioned that you could just use NVDIA Gforce, or something close to that, some people don't always have computers to play on, and some also use the frames-per-second counters for testing the speed of servers. As crazy as it sounds, the game checking its own speed can be a bit more accurate when regarding how quickly it's receiving information from the server, I don't know how else to explain it, I just believe that an external fps counter will be a bit inaccurate, in certain circumstances, since the game fps counter will be slow when your game is also slow.</span></p>",

I choose to play peaceful so my redstone and auto builds dont blow up, but then i have chests of bread just sitting there... waiting... it would be nice to be build these things with a purpose rather then for the rare swamp adventures or just because I can lol</p>",

And, if some people don't want this, you can just a button for peaceful that says \"Turn on Hunger\". Please, prove to us all that you do listen to our suggestions, and do this Please!!! This would make Minecraft SO MUCH BETTER! I'm begging you. Thanks for your time! Please add this idea in, I want to have fun with Minecraft, but without being blow up by a creeper.

One suggestion I have is reintroducing the skin viewer and the total Gamerscore counter that were in the older JSON UI. Here is why I think these two features should make a return:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The skin viewer was an important resource for server moderators because it assisted them in finding players who used exploits to change their skin in an inappropriate way which could harm the fun and integrity of that server.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The Gamerscore counter was a good way to tell the amount of activity on the persons account and verify it the Microsoft account is not being used solely for malicious purposes. (such as hacking)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below, I have attached a concept image that I made of what the profile screen could look like if the skin viewer and Gamerscore counter were added back. I tried to follow the design language of OreUI and kept things like the nice background banner that was present in the original OreUI player profile. Of course if players are uncomfortable with others freely seeing their skin or Gamerscore number, I believe there should always be accessibility options allowing that person to turn these off and return to the style of the original Updated Player Profile. Here is a glimpse of it I think the new OreUI player profile should look like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/user_images/01J4PYQYC3BZQPMBFHJA4AMV86.png\" data-image-token=\"undefined\">To learn more about this I recommend taking a look at MCPE-184075 on the Mojang Bug Tracker.&nbsp;</p>",

A great example for that would be an option to move the controls and be able to touch the screen with more than just two thumbs. Also maybe some hidden new buttons should be added! Like an attack-button this could be useful in the 1.16 update because if you hold you attack. This button should be able to be enabled or disable to be shown. I would like to play claw on my phone becuase it is difficult in PvP on the phone to compete against XBox or Windows 10 Players. Especially when playing Skywars or Murder Mystery also it is difficult to swap items at the same time or drop them. A shorter drop time should be added. Maybe you could add some buttons also enabled and disabled to switch items quickly between the slots it could be number buttons or &lt; &gt; buttons. It is 2019 and McPE needs better touch controls for Android and iOS!</p>\n\n<p>-This post was written for Mojang!\n<br />-Thanks in advance!</p>",

Ore UI at the moment is pretty notorious for being hardcoded (unlike JSON UI) and thus, limits the amount of UI customization for resource pack makers, which is odd, considering that Bedrock has more resource pack customization than Java. (Especially for entity models) For example, what if i wanted to modify the achievements screen to have a different layout? Well, since the JSON UI file is overwritten by the ORE UI design, I can't really do anything about it. So a toggle between the Classic UI and ORE UI would be a very good idea. That, or if Mojang decides NOT to restore JSON UI, AT LEAST they should let us customize the ORE UI, not just via the layout, but also by the button textures, etc.</p>",

The furnace shouldn't suddenly need information from blocks around it that can influence it's behavior. In this context only hoppers do that, but no block they interact with do that by themselves (chests, barrels, etc.)).</p>\n<p>If, on the other hand, the furnace would get a second output slot where it'd immediately put non smelt-able items from the input slot, a hopper below the furnace could pull smelted items and the non smelt-ables from it.</p>\n<p>But my preferred option is a whole other deal:</p>\n<p>Change the furnace so that if it is powered directly (redstone repeater or direct line of redstone dust) the input hoppers get switched -&gt; Fuel from above and smelt-able items from any side. Plus of course the input slot not accepting non smelt-able items and neighboring hoppers not being disabled by the powered furnace (this change might not be a good idea).</p>\n<p>This way the furnace could actually be used as (possibly very slow) filter for non smelt-able items.</p>\n<p><br>Or don't change the furnace at all and just allow item frames to turn hoppers into filters -&gt; [&lt;insert link to other feedback request here&gt;]</p>",
