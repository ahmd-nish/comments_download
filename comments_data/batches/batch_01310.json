I mean, this doesn't make players want to play the game more to find the enchantments they need, instead it makes players annoyed and want to quit playing minecraft, which in return will make minecraft lose more players. \"Making enchantments more difficult makes for a longer and more enjoyable experience, and an opportunity to explore biomes.\" no, i don't think so. I think instead of making the game more enjoyable, it will make it more unbearable. And besides, people already explore new biomes to find the blocks they need to finish a build, but to have to do that to trade with villagers is rediculous. I hope you can understand why I'm glad this only got 1 vote.</p>",
