Having more detailed versions of already existing structures (like caves, or other things) would be a good way to tempt people to travel out. At the same time, I think this would need stages/levels of progression. That way, you couldn't just get an elytra and fly 50k blocks in an hour and call it good for the rest of the game. It would be nice if each distance would also have an increase in difficulty of some kind (like maybe certain mobs, or mob spawn rates, or certain biome generation patterns)</p>\n<p>Level 1: 0 - 1,000</p>\n<p>Level 2: 1,000 - 10,000</p>\n<p>Level 3: 10,000 - 100,000</p>\n<p>Level 4: 100,00 +</p>\n<p><strong>I think this would work best if difficulty was a value selected only at world generation</strong>. That way, you could have different distances for each segmented level based on difficulty, and it would allow for players who are actually willing to go beyond normal skill levels, have more depth to it.</p>",
