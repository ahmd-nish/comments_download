This is already possible in the Java Edition of Minecraft, using the <code>/execute in</code> command:</p>\n<pre>execute in &lt;dimension&gt; run …</pre>\n<p>This command sets the execution position to another dimension, meaning if you use it to run a <code>/teleport</code> command, it will teleport the targeted entity to the dimension you specify. This command also respects dimension scaling, so the execution X and Z would be divided by 8 when executed in the Nether from the Overworld.</p>\n<p>May I also ask, with your current method, why do you have to put the players in Creative Mode?</p>",

For instance, maybe you have to kill a boss at the end of a minigame, but the boss has a state where he can't be hit, and there is a special point where he can be hit. This command would be perfect for this. So not only simply colliding with other entities, but also hitting them, which is a bit difficult to do if your player is already in a team for some reason.</p>",

Personally, I think it's better to immortalize players and turn off fire and explosions instead of freezing the game, as players can still move around freely.</p>\n<p>Besides, not all Minecraft players understand how server plugins work and are able to implement them. For example, I belong to this group of players. It seems easy to me to prevent griefing with one simple command. In sudden and unforeseen situations, action must be taken quickly. For instance, when someone is about to light a pile of TNT's near your house.</p>\n<p>For me it is really about everyone, including computer illiterates, being able to use a system that prevents vandalism at any time, without any preparations having to be made before. :-)</p>\n<p>Kind regards,</p>\n<p>Superquiner</p>",
