This also makes sense because when an ender pearl collides with a player or mob, it activates, so an ender pearl colliding with an arrow should also activate it. I think you should take some of the damage the arrow would normally deal along with any potion effect if it was a tipped arrow. This could add more purpose to things like slow falling arrows, as you would want to hit your own ender pearls with slow falling to prevent fall damage and softly land back down. Arrows activating ender pearls provides a good counter to seeing someone ender pearl away, but it requires a good amount of skill to make use of. You can use it offensively to stop someone from rushing or escaping with an ender pearl. You can also use it defensibly if you need to activate an ender pearl early, such as if you were to fall or get knocked off a cliff/mountain. With fast enough reactions, you could launch an ender pearl and snipe it with a crossbow to get your height back, and it would probably look amazing. I think this feature would allow for more skillful use around ender pearls, and I really hope it gets added to Minecraft.</p>",

All those times I went mining in pre-bundle times, I'd be stuck with small amounts of stackables, like different ores and flowers, but now I can merge together any stackables into a bundle. This has greatly extended my mining trips.</p>\n<p>Also this is the most powerful when it comes to carrying things like maps, before if you wanted to carry umpteen different maps, your best solution was bringing a shulker box, but now this is where bundle as actually even more powerful than a shulker box, being able to carry 64 different maps as opposed to 27! Maybe you wanna start a variety farm or something, and you can put in all different crop/seed/vine/tree types into one bundle for easy packaging, could have 64 different types of growables in 1 bundle (idk if there's even that many kinds).</p>\n<p>It's not too powerful but it has a definite advantage over shulker box, being able to consolidate different stackables into 1 slot. Only improvement would be the ability to pick a specific item out instead of the last one, or just dropping all. I don't think it needs an expansion, as useful as that sounds to have, it would be stepping on shulker box too much.</p>\n<p>One last thing, I initially dreaded getting the materials for making bundles because rabbits are semi rare and hard to catch, but it took me a long while to realize that cats can gift you string and rabbit hides!</p>",

While playing with crosshairs it’s harder to jump and hit the moving target simultaneously and Also definitely you can’t do any parkour moves as mouse&amp;keyboard users do. Gyroscope would definitely help smoothing the gameplay and gives touch players whole new experience.&nbsp;</p>",
