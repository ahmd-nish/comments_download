Also there's some delay between opening the menu and it pausing so it feels a little sluggish. In my opinion, the background should be dimmed in the pause menu to better reflect that it's paused and it would look better to me.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyway this is a GREAT step forward in improving Bedrock!

        "body": "<p>I thought of weapon dipping because of the current dipped arrows. This system would fit very well in the current system, and making the different materials have more viability, it would make people have more flexibility in choosing combat styles, perhaps a spell caster who uses a gold sword who wears a diamond suit. I guess he’d fight a person with full diamond. A player could fully customize his playstyle, pretty much making infinite possibilities for combat, which is currently limited to diamond everything and clicking and jumping.</p>",

Moreover, giving Gold the property of protecting you better against magic damage is one of the coolest ideas I have ever seen, I may writte an entire post dedicated to this.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Blades/Weapons:</strong> Honestly, that was a cool idea but I will give it a tweak. Submerging a sword or any other weapon into a cauldron full with a potion effect should absorb all the cauldron and change the weapon into a spell blade/weapon. The rest would be as you say.</p>",

Experience bar would be the mana or add in a new bar and some sort of charging block that uses lapiz or redstone as source of power or mana potions. My world is long over due for a decent mages guild. (Thinking like Morrowind - teleportation, levitate,summon, destruction. Enchanting is a lower form a magic (smithing/arcane) same as with alchemy. We need the more respected arcane arts. Staff, Books, Wands, Robes...

This is most likely due to the frost aspect which cools down the magma. But what if Frost Walker II were to be even colder, solidifying lava into magma temporarily before melting back up into lava. Using the same logic, it would mean that while walking on water the temperature will drop more than the first enchantment and therefore the ice could be blue ice instead of the packed ice texture (for further esthetics).</p>\n<p>Of course, like the frosted ice, the magma and \"blue ice\" issued from the enchantment would not be harvestable and will disapear after some time.</p>\n<p>The magma could disappear faster than the frosted ice as lava melts things faster than water. On the other hand, blue ice would stay longer than frosted ice because it is colder and will melt slower.</p>\n<p>Although this proposal is somewhat different than your original idea, it has the same core idea and it would be unnecessary to create a new thread for a similar idea. (it would also spread the votes thin)</p>\n<p>This would be an interesting addition to the game and would allow for better on foot travel in the nether.</p>",

It happens while flying and feels like we're on ice.</p>\n<p>I'm used to the old PS3 Creative Mode, where if you stop pressing the button to move, your player stops instantly. It makes the movement in creative mode a lot easier. I've also heard that some people get motion sickness from the drifty, icy movement.</p>\n<p>It would be the best to add an option instead of making the game use one way of flying or the other, I think. That way if you like the original flying, then you could leave it on.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It for some reason, changed to 64 once it hit Indev. It doesn't help that with the stack size being 64, its very easy to insta-mine a entire parameter with haste 2 beacons and fill up your chest and shulkers in a matter of minutes and then spend the next hour moving all that to your storage room which isn't in that cave. Too easy to fill up your inventory and it takes too long to empty it our or move it. Even if 64 is seen as \"iconic\", this is actively wasting the time of many builders, players, and storage room expansions.</p>\n<p>This stack size increase would ensure moving day in-game doesn't feel like moving day in real life; painful and slow despite being able to fly and carry tons in Shulker Boxes in-game unlike real life. This would only buff our ability to move items and make moving less of a hassle. This would solve one of the many inventory problems Minecraft is suffering from and would let us spend less time moving items and more time building with those bigger stacks.</p>",

I had a very similar thought, but with a little bit of variation.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;First of all, not every Biome would have these \"temperature effects\", only the extreme ones: Deserts, Extreme Hills, very cold snow Biomes or even the Deep Ocean biomes.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Also, it would be annoying if a player just walks&nbsp;into a biome and died from some kind of effect, so my idea was: the 1st. 1-2min. no effect, 3-4min. slight freezing effects such as hunger, slowness and then after being in the biome for more then 5min. the player will experience hunger, slowness, nausea, and slowly die.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, I like the idea of Armor/Protection, but, hot or cold drinks or food that would help with the extreme cold or hot temperatures would be a cool addition too.</p>\n<p>And because these biomes would be fairly&nbsp;dangerous, there should be some kind of reward: some kind of ruins, structures or special things spawn in these biomes that will give the player some kind of reward for surviving the harshes conditions in the game.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Anyways, again, great comment, and I would love it if they actually added something similar to our ideas!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

There would need to be careful balance and a bigger difference between weapons to make sure each is viable and the choice is up to the player. <br><br>Some ideas:<br>- Short swords can be dual wielded, can be spam clicked, have the highest dps but they don't damage shields to encourage attacking from the side or back.<br>- Swords can cleave more effectively than currently allowing hitting multiple enemies.<br>- Hammers ignore shields and do heavy damage to armour meaning they work best against single armoured targets.<br>- Spear <br>When you are holding a spear on a horse you do damage to any mobs you hit while riding on the horse. A spear could also be used off the horse, it has a longer reach than a sword but a slow recharge time.<br><br></p>",

        "body": "<p>Good idea, a lot of things would probably have to be tweaked as well for the thirst bar. The player could sip from any water sources but it’ll only give them half a bar. Glass bottles and water bottles could now generate in villages or other structures to make getting bottles easier. Like raw meats, bottles have to be put in a furnace to make pure water so that you don't get the 5-10% chance of getting hunger or thirst effect. A new utility block can be added for thirst mechanics called the juicer, which can mix water bottles with fruits, or other food items to create new juices that fill up your thirst bar more. With a new utility block comes with a new villager profession as well, called the mixologist or the barkeep, which obviously can trade the new juices with you for emeralds. Perhaps hotter biomes and dimensions such as the nether, savanna, mesa and desert biomes make your thirst drain faster? Perhaps the lower your thirst the more damage the player will take as well?</p>",
