A&nbsp;way to temporarily disable Sculk Sensors would fulfill what you're asking for. A lot of people have this idea because of how hard it is to work around in Redstone contraptions. I'm not a Redstone expert, so I don't know if that would totally work, but it seems pretty balanced and effective to me if you also use wool occlusion along with the temporary disable.</p>",
