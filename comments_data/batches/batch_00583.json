No matter how many lighting options are added to the game, options will be limited. This is especially apparent in large, flat areas where hidden lighting is extremely difficult to conceal.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The glowstone dust adding light to a block with right click is the perfect solution in my view. It allows players the freedom to fundamentally alter the way they play for the first time. Instead of building their buildings around light, they would now be able to build light around their builds. This is because they'd no longer have to be concerned about fitting in lighting in certain areas like they do now to make a build safe. There would still be a cost to do that (the glowstone dust) but it opens up an entirely new avenue and way to thinking about building in Minecraft that I think is sorely needed.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I've made a video <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbuSkIbJ5I4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> about this exact topic.

It would definitely add to the witch theme of the hut! Although, there are problems with it. LDShadowLady demonstrates that in one of her videos, when she places down her bow due to a mod, fighting mobs. Just something I wanted to mention. This is very good for creative when you wanna make a house, and you’re into decorating. Same with survival. LOTS of players love decor, including myself. So I think this would be a very good update, but it’s the players fault if they place down their sword while fighting the wither because of this suggestion.</p>",

        "body": "<p>We need a whole update related to magic if you ask me. Minecraft needs a more broad stretch of fighting styles. It would be really cool if Minecraft had different “categories” that you could pick from and upgrade. So maybe instead of having regular armor, you could sacrifice wearing a chest plate for a cloak that allows you to slow fall on command or maybe you could wear a pair of boots that allow you to double jump without having the ability to use feather falling. There are so many great ideas that people have related to magic and the whole combat system in general. Fingers crossed that Mojang will make some awesome changes to the combat system.</p>",
