And yes, this would be beneficial to teach people color theory. I would also really appreciate a new shade of green between the dark olive green we get from cactuses and light lime green (which we get by adding white dye to olive green). It definitely would make creative builds in survival easier.</p>",

The vast player base plays on Multiplayer servers and realms, and having them punished for something so small on one server is ridiculous to have them banned from playing Multiplayer entirely. Just let server/realm staff members deal with the chat reports. It shouldn't be something for Microsoft to interfere with.</p>",

We still haven't had a return on ore settings and independent X/Z noise stretching, and some other things which I don't explicitly know about - because the new feature is really hard to research and compare with the old one - and this makes for an untold thousands of good Customized things that we still can't do in the most recent version of Minecraft. We can't be complacent, Custom 1.16 does not have everything it needs. It doesn't matter if a feature of 1.12 that hasn't come back looks small and unimportant, because for hundreds of people the chances are very high that the feature is an important one and had some really enthused plans riding on it. Saying it doesn't need to come back on the grounds that \"I don't care, I have no idea what I'd use it for\" would be a selfish reason to deprive somebody of it who has a good idea for what they want to use it for.</p>",
