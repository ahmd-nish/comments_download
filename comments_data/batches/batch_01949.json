Now It could be possible that they are working on it. But this forum seems a bit old. I highly agree that k&amp;m should be compatible on ps4 minecraft. I doubt that mojang is still working on it a whole year later from this forum. But I mean, come on already the people want k&amp;m compatibility for ps4 and the people who don't care about It can stay with controllers. Again, I hope they are still working on it or are starting to work on it. PLEASE make it compatible already you would get so many more people playing it and finding friends on these new mini games. Please just add it already. It's much needed and greatly valued.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>EDIT: so i read somewhere that mojang offered to release the compatability to Sony but Sony declined. Basically means that ps4 will never see keyboard and mouse function. So a strong suggestion for &nbsp;everyone who wants to play &nbsp;keyboard and mouse on ps4. You should leave a response on a Sony feedback page. It is there fault we can't play with keyboard and mouse. For some reason they want to be stingy like that :(</p>",

And another thing that although it is not very related to the achievements but in any case is a suggestion. My other suggestion is that depending on your outfit that you acquired in an achievement, you would get a bonus or boost when doing a certain action (Ex .: When you conquer an achievement of wearing 30 emeralds with a villager you get a green outfit and with that outfit on you have a slight \"Hero of the Village\" effect or you would get a bonus when making a trade with a villager).

And now it's properly ordered. I also like that I can see details of the achievement in an amplified way, and that is how you can have access to the rewards.</p>\n<p>There are things I would like to ask: You can still improve a little more. 1. I would like you to add a few more descriptive details on how to get achievements, especially on which specific biome will need to be explored to complete. 2. Could you add the possibility of using bumpers buttons to change category either all, locked, and completed? 3. Could you change the color of progress (either total progress potion and progress bar) blue to green? Because with that it looks more like you have experience (You know what I mean).</p>\n<p>More ideas will probably come to me later.</p>\n<p>And I think it would be all about my opinion.

The status affect is, in my opinion, not the best way to display this. As stated it is traditionally used to dislpay affects on the player. Yes I know, insomnia is a player specific affect. I think a great solution would be to have a phantom appear behind the player in your inventory GUI. The more visable the phantom is, the greater your insomnia. I also like the idea suggested for Coffee, we could really use this on a server and realm. Coffee could reduce your insomnia but not make it disapear completely. Also the Coffee would have limited affectiveness the more you consume until it become neccesary for you to sleep.</p>",

        "body": "<p>@alexboy1256, as you seem to be able to do it, can you please help me out? I am on console (Xbox) and have opened a command block and have entered a command. Now I want to select that command with ctrl+a, then copy it with ctrl+c, and then open another command block, go to the input field and paste it with ctrl+v. Is this what you are suggesting? I so want to be able to do that! This is how it went when I tried. The first problem I had was that I could not find the ctrl key on the virtual keyboard so I connected an Xbox One chatpad (from Microsoft) to my controller and tried to enter ctrl+a with that. I also couldn't find the ctrl key on the chatpad.😂 I then connected a normal wired USB keyboard to my Xbox. That keyboard has a ctrl-key. (So I can enter ctrl+a, but I would like to do that with my controller and the virtual keyboard or with the chatpad as a normal keyboard is less comfortable when playing on the couch). When I now press ctrl+a nothing gets selected. I tried entering text with the USB keyboard and that works but ctrl+a doesn't do anything.😢&nbsp; Am I missing something? What am I doing wrong? Or is that a bug? (I am not in the beta). If you (or anyone else) can help me out, thank you so much in advance!!! And otherwise I really hope an easy way to copy and paste text on Xbox will be added.😊</p>",
