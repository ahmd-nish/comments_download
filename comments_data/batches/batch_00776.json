People would set up huge energy storage facilities and power grids with lighting rods, maybe certain biomes like jungles could thunder storm more often, making so that if you want the most energy possible you have to set up massive amounts of infrastructure in these biomes. Maybe the longer energy engorging travels along a wire without going through something like a circuit it looses Charge, so you have to set up these long lines across your world with repeater things along it to get energy. </p>",

It’s not like batteries we put in remotes in the real world, it’s a block, that in my mind is made of copper, it has connection ports drumming out of it, along with 4 blue bars in the front indicating battery level. This next one is about the repeater, I don’t know if this would even be a thing but if it is, it wouldn’t have to be as close together as red stone repeaters, in my mind they were far apart, and kind of looked like power line poles with a repeater on top</p>",

Before the cave update, I think there was too much of it and I already wanted less dirt, because it's bizarre to find it close to the bedrock. But with the 21w06a snapshot, I was shocked to see big clusters of dirt in the new caves, especially in odd places like in the middle of pillars.</p>\n<p>About clay, I agree that it would be great to find it in caves because it's too rare in the game, and caves are a realistic place to find it. Let's agree, though, that it shouldn't <em>exactly</em> replace dirt, in the sense of generate in the former place of it. It should generate in more natural place, like at the bottom of pools in dripstone caves, as you say.</p>",
