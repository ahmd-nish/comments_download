Instead of the ender chest idea and linking them somehow, introduce a new hopper type that has fewer slots and works from nether to overworld but only if it is near a portal. You can already use portals to transfer items but its not always reliable. Alternativly a single block similar to the End gates that can transfer items wirelessly. But i do feel like this would all take alot of the need for all the transportation tihngs in minecraft already. it would need to be balanced and maybe an end game item like elaytra or the beacon.</p>",

I imagine the output direction to work similar to an observer block, but instead of a sudden observation triggering a short pulse in the defined direction a continuous response due to an incoming redstone signal is performed. The output signal strength should be the same as the input signal strength to be consistent with the rules of regular blocks.</p>\n<p>This block would help me to build storage indicators via redstone lamps: I have to space out each slice of storage to avoid powering the wrong redstone lamps. Having each slice right next to each other would require a complicated redstone wiring to ensure the circuit independency of each slice. With either the \"corner repeater\" or the above described directional output block available I would literally have to add only a single block to each slice to avoid the extra spacing.</p>",
