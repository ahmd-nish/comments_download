Let's celebrate this new era of Minecraft's history by adding the cape to both versions, so more people can enjoy the fun!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>In addition, almost every major cape introduced since the Migrator cape in 2021 has been added to both editions of the game. Adding the cape to java and bedrock too would only continue this trend and not be out of the ordinary. Dare I say, it may even be a bit odd and arbitrary for this cape to only be in one edition.<br><br>Thank you for listening to our feedback!</div>",
