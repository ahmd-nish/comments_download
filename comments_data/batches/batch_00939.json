The cycle of the sun and moon helps players track the time during day/night. It's a constant cycle that's a core part of the game. Having eclipses would require differentiating speeds of the sun and moon, and would completely remove the ability to track day and night (particularly night). Having a more unrealistic version of an eclipse, like a small random chance that the sun happens to be eclipsed when it rises would be more fitting. This would be the only way I would see it realistically possible without changing core elements of the game.</p>",

Imagine a Skywars game; a player on PC would be able to loot chests and organise their inventory so much faster than a console player. Currently mobile players can organise the fastest because they can just select the item they want to move and just tap the slot where they want it to go. However, this isn't unbalanced as mobile players are already at a significant disadvantage just by being on mobile. PC players already have the advantage over console players just by being able to hotkey.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I used to think it should be added because yes, it would be nice. Then I thought a little bit and realised that it would just make PvP more imbalanced. Maybe when more servers have input based matchmaking it would make more sense but currently, I am fully against it.</p>",

However, it does have its own version: Piercing. Piercing allows the arrow to travel through several mobs (up to 4 with Piercing 4) and still hit the ground, able to be picked back up, essentially making for unlimited arrows, unless you happen to shoot in the direction of 5 lined-up creepers for no prticular reason or just have a mob farm.</p>",

I wouldn’t mind if they were compatible again, I would enjoy it like all orders,&nbsp;or if they stay mutually exclusive. As of right now, I recommend enchanting your bow with mending rather than infinity as you will never lose it due to too many uses of the anvil, and collecting arrows may be found easy just by the use of a looting 3 sword on skeletons, especially in skeleton dungeons, I have done this many times and I gain more arrows than I lose.

(This is from personal experience with neighbor.) A way to balance this out is have up to 10 extra uses for arrows (Infinity 5 (or 2 with Infinity 1)). A side note is that with Mending it already uses EXP to repair but the same amount every time so if Mending+Infinity is still a no make a new block like a grindstone but allow another of the same item (not just the same materials) to be combined to fix the weapon/tool/armor with EXP but the amount varies on the enchantments. So if the bow has had a enchantment with Power 3 and Unbreaking 3 and then a book was added to put Infinity on it, the EXP to repair it with another bow would be (just a random but a balanced seeming number) 72% of the EXP required to change the name of the bow (so 28% off).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I don't know about anyone else but this seems balanced to me.</p>",

This leaves the infinity enchantment in the dust as it is no longer worth using. It is such a simple change that I don’t see why it isn’t worth it. The only real opposition to this is the comp side of the game. Comp servers have to use mods anyway, but for most players this isn’t as possible.

Mojang allows for mending on other weapons, including tridents that have loyalty on them which essentially is the same as infinity for tridents. The main reason I'm aware of that it was taken out was because of people in PvP tournaments and such spamming arrows across the map like a machinegun, but with the way bows are now that's not possible anyway. Also as mentioned all other weapons can have mending without any issue to their other enchants. This means that while someone may have an infinity bow once the durability runs out they can't attack while someone with a loyalty trident, or a sword or axe still can attack. if you think it's broken then just have it as a toggle in the options menu for the Admins that are hosting to switch on or off for the server, and have the same toggle for those of us in single player to make it so we aren't having to either make a LOT of infinity bows because they eventually break, or we have to carry around an ungodly number of arrows because we don't have infinity on our bow...till it's fixed I'm using mods to fix it sense Mojang seems to be refusing to budge because of people being silly in PvP.</p>",

Minecraft is all about customization, so more options to adjust gameplay would be ideal. A toggle system would allow players to enjoy \"Keep Inventory\" on higher difficulties like Normal and Hard, offering flexibility for those who want to focus more on creative exploration without the penalty of losing items.

This could include the hinted at idea that when dying, you loose all enchantment levels but keep your stuff, but also having a littler bit more difficult of an option where the player looses all items but their main tools and armor might be cool too, since loosing all of those important stuff is what really causes players to rage quit. Having all 3 of these versions of keep inventory will add more customizability to the vanilla game and let players shape their experience to what they are able to handle.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I also think it would help a lot if at least the harder versions of keep inventory were togglable for normal mode as well, as the players using those would likely still want a challenge defeating mobs in their world. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps this might lead to a progressive difficulty but that an entirely different thing that changes a lot of Minecraft's fundamentals so I'm not sure that would be in consideration.</p>",

For easy, all items drop, but XP decreases to three levels, rather than all of them as it is in the game right now. In addition, the items and XP despawn after 30 minutes, instead of five minutes by default. On Normal, it's also a little bit different. All the items drop, XP decreases to five levels, and everything despawns after 15 minutes. On Hard (and hardcore), all items drop, XP decreases to ten levels, and despawning happens after five minutes. This level of scaling would be better depending on which difficulty people choose. Incorporating this premise into the game would be good for Bedrock and Java.</p>",

This would allow players who need it to be able to use it effectively without a complete revamp to Compass items. It's not perfect considering that the Ancient City is still very difficult for players who need this mechanic, but I think it would be a very vanilla-friendly way to allow Keep Inventory in default Survival modes.</p>",

I think it should be in the same tier as show coordinates. I get creative mode breaking achievements, but a feature I’d consider an accessibility thing shouldn’t bar you from gaining progress. A like comparison is Celeste’s assist mode. I personally don’t feel any shame in not wanting to have to trudge 15 miles to pick up my stuff. What I do want is a penalty. EXP might be a good reason to keep yourself alive? Keepinventory hurts because you’re screwed either way. If you turn it on, you lose achievements and don’t have any penalty for death. If you turn it off, you can’t turn it back on without “cheating” and you have to fetch your stuff.</span></p>",

For example, advanced technical players find some aspects of the game easier on higher difficulties because of the changes to mob spawning and villager zombification and so on.</p>\n<p>In light of that I propose also adding a custom difficulty where things can be toggled on/off from the beginning. There a player could find some of the most used game rules plus a few others. For example, a option of disabling natural mob spawning while also being able to spawn mobs would be really cool.</p>\n<p>There is also the much proposed idea of a form of gravestone mechanism which could synergize really nicely with the recovery compass and might also make a better distinction between versions, but that is just one of those player dreams that are not really gonna happen any time soon.</p>",

And so, having it be accessible to all can feel like it diminishes the efforts of those who play without that safety net. But that’s what everyone understands about this.<br><br>While it might be more work, I believe the best way of handling this is to have an icon in the inventory that indicates keepinventory is active, similar to how hearts are labeled differently for hardcore. This ends up legitimizing both ways of playing.<br><br>Then, the toggle could be moved out of the ‘Cheats’ section, as the icon appearing in the inventory would handle much of the tension around the topic. <br><br>Could people still switch it on and off when it suits them after the world has been generated? That would have to be a design decision on Mojang’s end. But as long as this is properly handled, having the different difficulties have different base gamerules wouldn’t be too troublesome to manage after that.<br><br>Minecraft benefits greatly from having very modular settings. Freedom of play is a massive component, and so, if it’s possible, avoid locking some settings to others.</span></span></p>",

Personally, I find it really hard to enjoy playing survival without keep inventory because it really demotivating to lose all of my stuff after spending so much time collecting things. Maybe a middle ground could be randomly losing items or only losing things you've collected/added to your inventory since you last slept (similar to Subnautica). Overall, I don't think it's a bad idea, it should just be an option for people to decide for themselves to enjoy the game how they like! :)</span></div>",

        "body": "<p>TLDR: Add it as a setting to the main page of world creation, don’t make it a part of easy mode as it is different gameplay change then difficulty.</p>\n<p>As someone who went from playing with keep inventory on to with it off, it changes the gameplay a lot. Risks lose value, and preparation is unnecessary. In easy mode, defeating a nether fortress should be easier than hard mode (duh), but without the risk of losing stuff you can just head in carelessly over and over and not get punished. This trivializes the survival aspect. Running out of food? Just die, you keep your EXP! It goes against the core of a survival game, no matter what difficulty setting it is on. What about people who want to have an easy experience, but still want their actions to have consequences? Sometimes I put the game on easy, so the mobs aren’t as annoying. But when I mess around with my friends in that world, or they mess with me, I still want players to drop inventory so when they steal my stuff, I can get it back. With Keep inventory, all I can do is send them home faster, still with my diamonds. Inventory and difficulty change the game in different ways. They should NOT be tied to each other.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;Keep inventory is the best and probably the most fun and useful cheat. Especially for casual or younger players. But it is cheating. It should be easy to turn on and easy to find for those who want it, and not forced on those who simply want an easier experience but with the same challenge of repercussions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Turning on Keep Inventory resulted in younger players having a much better time, and older players liked not having to worry about grinding for rare gear (such as the mace) again if something happened to them.</p>\n<p>However, we have noticed that players sometimes use it as a free teleport home button - which is probably not in line with how you want players to interact with death. Having some consequence like losing your XP would solve this to a certain extent. We tried implementing this with command blocks but it was rather buggy so we stopped, but when it worked it was a good compromise.</p>\n<p>On the whole, I would like to see significantly more options around player death be surfaced by player / server settings. More granular settings for player death would be useful for getting community feedback as well.</p>",

Make so that if you enable easy or peaceful, you have the option to toggle keep inventory on or off. Number two and I think the better one, Make it so that if you die in peaceful or easy you only loose non valuable items, such as blocks. You don't loose items such as tools and armor. I found this from a mod, and if you want to see it, it's called Keep Equipment, which you can find on Curseforge if you want to check it out.</p>",

I don't love having to go to a higher difficulty to play without keepinv, or not being able to play harder difficulties if I want keepinv.

As an example, dying in Normal or Hard with Keep Inventory on will still cause you to drop items in your inventory but certain inventory slots, such as the armour slots and hotbar, are kept upon death, which will encourage players to engage with inventory management and still keep some form of punishment upon death. And as an extra, you could also have 'full' Keep Inventory for the classic Keep Inventory experience as it exists now for those who want it.</p>",

In the past I have had worlds where I turned on keepInventory and it usually resulted in death becoming a form of fast travel back to my respawn point with no drawbacks whatsoever. I believe that this would be a poor precedent to set for a newer player, and it would lead them to taking more risks than could be considered tactical since there would never be any punishment to taking said risks; this would eventually lead to increased frustration when trying out higher levels of difficulty.</p>\n<p>The three main dangers of losing items on death are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The player does not have the items anymore (obviously!)</li>\n<li>The items will despawn if the player is too slow in getting back to them (assuming they're in a loaded chunk)</li>\n<li>The player may not remember where they died</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have seen a proposal in these comments to allow players to keep only the items in their hotbar, and I believe this is an idea worth exploring.

If you die in Peaceful, you keep all of your items and xp. Die in Easy, and you lose half your xp, but still keep all your items.

If so, then why change how difficulties work when creating a world?<br><br>The reason people don't turn on \"keep inventory\" is because they, either, don't see it, or don't want their achievements to be disabled. People look at the \"cheat\" tab and say, \"I should probably avoid that because I'm not a cheater.\"<br><br>Basically, you're addressing the wrong issue. If you don't want people to feel penalized for using keep inventory, then move it out of the cheat tab and make it not count against achievements. If it'll continue to count against achievements, then all you're doing is setting younger Minecraft fans up for failure by disabling their achievements automatically.<br><br>Personally, I think the menu on Bedrock is fairly bad because of the layout. You updated 1 or 2 of the screens, then haven't touched it in the years since. Considering the style changes between the menus, it comes across as sloppy; It really shouldn't take years to change the menu style/format.<br><br>If you don't want \"keep inventory\" to penalize the player's ability to earn achievements, then take it out of that tab. If you still want it to penalize the player, but just want it to be more visible, then finish updating the menus and move the cheats into the open</p>",

The invisible 5 minute timer that only counts down while items are in render distance is incredibly unintuitive for items dropped by players on death, especially since it often takes more than 5 minutes to figure out where you died. The 5 minute timer is great for items dropped in the world, but not for players seeking to recover those items, especially if they don’t realize that they despawn after a certain amount of time. As new updates introduce items that are difficult to collect (like the mace), dying and losing your items becomes more punishing, so having the grace of time to be able to collect your items again makes the system feel a lot more fair.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Adding in my two cents - I'm generally in agreement that making Keep Inventory more accessible is a good thing, but that letting a player keep their full inventory by just changing the difficulty is the wrong way to go about it. Death, as a mechanic, is meant to be a punishment for poor gameplay. Without the threat of losing your inventory, it becomes at best a very minor nuisance (I wasn't done exploring that cave but whatever) and at worst an active benefit (I'll just jump off this cliff and get a free ticket to spawn).</p>\n<p>There are two options that make sense to me within Minecraft's framework:<br>1) Terraria-style difficulty. Keep peaceful, easy, medium, and hard as-is, and have a secondary difficulty option for Keep Inventory, no Keep Inventory, and Hardcore (permadeath). This allows players to easily choose their preferred mix of difficulty settings without having to dig through menus to find the right options. This also makes server management easier, as the choice of inventory management is <em>explicit </em>rather than implicit.<br>2) Keep Inventory \"lite.\" If we insist on tying Keep Inventory to world difficulty, it may be better to introduce an in-between \"mode\" that reduces the punishment of dying but allows it to remain an undesirable outcome. An example (though by no means the best) would be for the player to lose some portion of their ores or mob drops on death. This allows them to still make net progress while incentivizing them to avoid death as much as possible.</p>",

For example if it is currently on Normal but at one point it was on easy then at the top of the world settings it would say \"this world has been on easy.\" This would add satisfaction for players challenging themselves with harder difficulties, especially since peaceful is basically cheating as is.</p>",

Everyone who wants keep inventory can already figure out how to use it.

Want a tougher fight? up the difficulty! Enjoy the increased penalty on death by dropping items? There's your setting! Put on the pressure with only one life? We call that Hardcore.</p>\n<p>Different gaming styles give different experiences, and a game like minecraft thrives on customization!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I started by calling Keepinventory a cheat. Maybe it's time to look at what we class this setting (and others?) as, similar to if we want a superflat/terrained world, or how tough we want our monsters!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>- Theres the issue with achievements too, but I think that depends on how you see it. Is keepinventory a legit way to play the game and thus earn them? Is easy difficulty as much an acceptable way to earn a wither kill as someone playing hardcore and using a safe strat like end fountain? I struggle to see the difference in rights for the shiny, digital, gold star.</p>\n<p>Edit: Correct me, if this is wrong(Java player), but are the achievements not similar to the advancements? Which in the early part of the game, serves as guidance? Opening inventory and making a workbench. It makes little sense to turn those off simply because of a cheat setting, and you HAVE done the action!</p>",

At first it's gonna feel great cause he doesn't have to worry about anything. But then what? What motivating factor does the game have now? You can say it's a sandbox, but the core game has built-in motivators for a reason. Now for Little Timmy every cave expedition will be about as exciting as grocery shopping because it doesn't matter what happens, he's fine. Every time will be the same, he just gets ore and goes back, either on foot or via respawn. Wither, Ender Dragon, Warden, they all go from memorable cool moments to bland whatever because you can just keep respawning at no cost and eventually win. Why build cool landmarks in your world when you can just jump off a cliff and respawn for free whenever you get lost? Heck, now you only have to travel one way and you can instantly blink back via tactically dying. The game turns into mush.</p>\n<p>Worst of all, Timmy won't turn the difficulty back up. Once you've gained a certain convenience it's really hard to deprive yourself of it, even for an aware adult, let alone a kid who probably can't even identify the issue. From Timmy's perspective, after playing with KeepInventory on for a while, he'll conclude that this game is boring and stop playing.You'd be robbing Timmy of a game he might otherwise love. Please do not implement this.</p>",

Instead of mob damage being different, the spawn rate of mobs increases with the difficulty. Easy would be how they spawn now. Normal would have increased spawns and sight radius, and hard increases it further. I want hard mode to be like that one 1.16 snapshot where the Ghasts spawned more frequently than intended. That was one of my favorite moments in Minecraft. Any abilities restricted to hard mode would be given in any difficulty mode. As for the Keep Inventory for easy mode, as much as I love using it, I don't think it should be forced on players. If you're worried about item loss scaring off new players, just give an alert that it's there for them when they select \"Create New World.\" They should be able to have the alert not pop up for them in the future. This is a better solution, I think.</p>",

Considering it as more of an option than a cheat is a great change. Entirely removing the option to change it in some cases is weird and imposes a needless restriction on user experience. I feel like options (or 'cheats') that do not inherently bring players a lot closer to an achievement should not block achievements entirely. Keep inventory is just a play style option that saves time, reduces risk (not to be confused with difficulty), and can make the game less stressful for some players. It doesn't eliminate or bypass any of the meaningful work/gameplay that gets put towards most achievements.</p>",

Not to mention the impact this change will have on the speed running community which utilizes the differences between normal and easy to speed run the game. I could dive deep into the problems but I believe everyone else on this forum will have already done so.<br><br>Solutions:<br>Solution 1: (least effort) make it so easy mode keep inv is off and peaceful mode keep inv is on. This wont affect the SR community at all as a run is invalid if swapped to peaceful. It will still make easy more challenging for players. And it makes a lot of sense that peaceful mode the mode with 0 hostile mobs also has 0 consequences if a player dies.<br>Solution 2: Add an in-between for easy and normal where easy would still be keep inv but the in-between would have the current \"easy mode\" rules. Doing this would also open avenues for an Ultra hard mode or an in-between for Normal and Hard mode which could be exciting and add new extreme challenges to the game without moding (similar to terraria's for the worthy, ect.)<br>Solution 3: On easy instead of it being a fully fledged keep inv, instead replace that with a keep hotbar or keep XP. Something less powerful than literally 0 loss. I personally still don't love this solution but I could see how the community more broadly would still entertain this idea. The MCSR scene would definitely undergo some decent changes but nothing it can't handle.</p>",

        "body": "<p>It is a great concept and would be fun to have as an ability to toggle if you are considering keep inventory less as a \"Cheat\" and more as a feature to help new players in playing Minecraft, though, it may change the way we perceive the \"Authentic Survival Experience.\" Firstly, a conflict that may occur later on if you end up implementing it \"as is\" or similar to how it is in the previews right now would be <em>further increasing the difficulty spike </em>from <em>Peaceful </em>or <em>Easy</em> to <em>Normal</em> and eventually <em>Hard</em> and <em>Hardcore</em>. Also, it takes away an experience that feels fundamental to every player who experiences survival Minecraft for the first time, the impact of the \"You Died\" screen. The experience of losing all of your items is something that every player should experience at some point, it is a character builder. When you get blown up by a creeper as you were admiring the dirt hut you built and lose all of your stuff, its like getting knocked down and it teaches the player to grow, to get back up even in the face of hardship (losing all of your items) so that when something harder to deal with comes (Losing your Hardcore world) you aren't as severely affected. When it comes to getting achievements, it does not feel as rewarding getting them with keep inventory on in easier modes than having it off. For example, if you were learning how to ride a bike, it feels more rewarding to be able to learn without the need for training wheels though with will do all the same. Hope this Helps :)</p>",

But if I played on Hard mode, I would die constantly from how much damage the mobs are dealing.

Keep Inventory is a setting that removes any and all risk from any difficulty, so I personally don't think it should be something that is automatically turned on, rather if you wanted to make the beginner experience easier using Keep Inventory, it should be by moving the toggle to the main world creation page and increasing it's exposure. I also think keeping Keep Inventory as a \"cheat\" would be good, just instead of having a turn on the cheat toggle it gives a pop-up instead letting you know the turning this on disables achievements. This way it's more obvious for first time players or anyone wanting a easier playing experience that such a setting exists.</p>",

This lost inventory mecanic is only for people who play for the survival aspect of it. Personally I enjoy building and gathering/exploring. To me this is a chill game and the prospect of losing half of my progress to a bad fall makes things more stressful. Then if you're lucky you can spend five minutes racing an arbitrary timer to get your stuff back. I usually play in easy and activate keepInventory. I understand that this is not for everyone, but in my opinion most players who pick the easy difficulty do not really care about the survival aspect as much (or are making more mistakes / would get frustrated by losing their progress this often). IMO this makes perfect sense for an easy mode. It's not even the default difficulty so this does not impact anything about \"the minecraft experience\".</p>",

Preserving Challenge and Gameplay Integrity:</strong> Minecraft has always balanced challenge and reward. Losing items upon death adds tension and strategy, fostering a sense of accomplishment. If players retain inventory, it diminishes this feeling, making the game less engaging and trivializing risk.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Impact on Game Dynamics:</strong> Allowing players to keep items alters multiplayer experiences. In cooperative play, retaining inventory can lead to reckless behavior, undermining teamwork and respect for environmental challenges. This change could diminish the collaborative spirit that makes multiplayer enjoyable.</p>\n<p><strong>3. De-emphasizing Skill Development:</strong> Minecraft encourages skill growth through exploration and resource management. Retaining items reduces the incentive to improve. The current system motivates players to navigate danger thoughtfully, while less challenge may lead to stagnation in player development.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Nature of Survival Modes:</strong> As a survival game, Minecraft inherently involves risks and consequences. Altering rules in Easy and Peaceful modes undermines survival gameplay, which is about managing risks. Keeping the current system preserves the core mechanics that define the game.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Preserving Achievement Integrity:</strong> While not considering \"Keep Inventory\" a cheat may seem beneficial, it risks ruining the value of achievements.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

I wouldnt mind mobs hitting harder and healing being more difficult to deal with but ive never liked the world deletion idea. Maybe the world deletion could be moved to its own seperate option like keep inventory and could be enabled on lower difficulty worlds. Could be fun to have a peaceful world but if you die your world disappears. Likewise, it would be nice to seperate XP from keep inventory, allow death to take XP but not items, or vice versa.</p>",

Instead, it would make more sense just to make it so that more players, especially newer ones, would be aware of it when making a world, like maybe just putting it right next to the difficulty selector on the create world screen. Another idea that I have is that a third keepInventory option could be added where you only keep things like tools and armor but lose everything else like blocks, food, ores and xp. This would keep some level of risk in the game but if you do die then you will still be able to get it back pretty easily or at least won't lose everything. Also, if it is added automatically it should definitely still count as a cheat because it makes the gaming experience vastly easier and takes away almost all risk.&nbsp;</p>",

It happens so often in a game where I'll slowly grind better and better gear, die in an accident, recover some back-up loot, and find out after 20 minutes of traveling that all my hours of work has despawned. I really appreciate Minecraft's sense of urgency when I die, and using backup loot to get my stuff back is quite fun, but losing all my stuff to an unknown amount of time is what really causes me to lose interest in worlds I pour hours and hours into. I feel like, instead of making Keep Inventory on by default and practically eliminating the threat of dying, the items you drop from death shouldn't despawn, either as easily or at all. I don't know if this should apply to all difficulties, but at least on Easy and Medium, it would be way more engaging and reassuring if I either knew that my stuff wouldn't go away, or if there was some sort of timer or indication letting me know when they were about to go away. Another idea that I've seen tossed around is creating a rare item in normal play that would allow players to Keep Inventory once before being consumed, like a Totem of Retaining, probably in Ancient Cities or Ocean Monuments. For balance reasons, they would be exceedingly rare and not keep experience.</p>",

Then I started watching Minecraft videos and got interested in the game again, gave it a second chance, funny enough, even thought I found out that \"keep inventory\" can be turned on, and even started playing a world with this setting, I then switched to a server where it was turned off, I fell into the \"inventory loss ring\" again and lost interest again for a year. Then I also tried playing Bedrock, thinking I might like it better for it's core mechanics, and I did like it better, but not being able to get any achievements was really disappointing. I'm currently playing on my own Java server with the Create mod and keep inventory on and I'm happy with that</p>\n<p>I'm pretty sure that at the scale of Minecraft sales, tens of millions of players just left the game because they didn't even know about the existence of keep inventory setting, not every person will give a second chance to the game like me, plus I know people who by just hearing about such a mechanic, will not even try in first place</p>\n<p>Inventory loss is simply too strong a punishment to be on all difficulties, it just doesn't fit in a game like this, it should only be only hard, because even on normal it's way too &nbsp;much</p>",

The problem with this change is that keep inventory and world difficulty are two very different types of challenge that people are going to enjoy different amounts, and so linking those two options together means that players have less options. Trying to make the game more fun for them in one way may make it less fun in another; for example, a player who enjoys combat but dislikes the stress of losing all their stuff is forced to either stick with easy where fights aren't as challenging, or go to normal/hard where that stress of losing progress is far more prevalent.</p>\n<p>I do agree with the accessibility side of this change, as giving easier options to newer players who may not otherwise know that these opitons exist may help them get into the game, however there are more ways of doing this other than just easy=keep inv. A good solution to this could be to modify the ui; add keep inventory as an option under the difficulty options, and maybe give a pop-up saying that it's recommended for newer/more casual players. This enables anyone to have a more casual experience and for newcomers to have a better time while still giving veterans more of a challenge.</p>\n<p>A good reference point for this is Fire Emblem's casual vs classic modes, which works really well for it, but this post is getting too long anyway lol</p>",

On peaceful difficulty, I could see arguments supporting implementing this change, as many beginner players already know that peaceful is the easiest and safest way to play the game, so I believe this adds another element of convenience and improves quality of life. However, I do not feel the same way about the implementation in easy mode. Once hostile mobs are introduced, I believe that players should become familiar with the risks associated with encountering hostile mobs throughout the world. This change highlights Mojang's interest in catering towards every play style, but as it stands, currently exposes itself as solely catering towards beginner players. If the keep inventory option was moved to a more prominent page that a beginner is more likely to see, or another element/greater difficulty was introduced for the harder difficulties to balance out this change, an update to the difficulty system in Minecraft could successfully cater to all play styles without compromising one of the game's most integral components.</p>",

Keep Inventory still should disable achievements tho.<br>Another option would be a seperated gamemode, so that there is a savemode besides survival and hardcore where you keep your inventory and maybe even with disabled mob griefing.</p>",

Also when creating a world, put the keep inventory rule under the world name instead of a hidden menu. This way whoever wants it, will enable it.

If you're new, you don't have to care about achievements. But, in the event that they do add it, I highly suggest that there would be a way to turn it off if you want to play it on peaceful, but without keep inventory. Another point I have, would be to make it so you would lose your levels, not your items. Keep inventory completely removes the risk of the game, so it would be better to at least take something away after dying. Finally, there should at least be a way to turn it off, and, if not, take away levels after dying.</p>",

When a player makes certain achievements in the world there should be changes to increase the likelihood of mobs spawning with armor or just a general attribute buff.

Keepinventory should remain toggleable but remain not as a cheat but it should still disable achievements otherwise achievements won't be achievements anymore. the point of achievements is they're hard to earn (IE: \"when did we get here\", \"beaconater\", \"the beginning\", and \"the end\") so not everyone may have them.

I wasn't sure what perks would be useful, but I saw this post: <a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360072044411-Crystalite\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/community/posts/360072044411-Crystalite</a> and thought an upgrade that saves your armor and tools when you accidentally break them would be amazing.</p>\n<p>Imagine hearing your tools break, then the musical crystal jingle, and your tools are at now diamond and at ~5% durability instead of being destroyed. It would be an interesting decision between that and the lava protection and extra durability of netherite.</p>\n<p>It's important to keep in mind that potential upgrades shouldn't do what enchantments can do, but there are options.</p>",

If we wind up getting any more armor tiers in the future, we're not going to be able to have a linear progression system anymore, because it will simply be too long, and in my opinion, this is not sustainable.</p>\n<p>In a small armor tree, like in pre-1.16, each tier of equipment was meaningful because it represented a significant step forward in the game. But, for instance, if intermediate armor sets like Copper were inserted into the tree, it would turn into something like Final Fantasy: You buy a bunch of equipment for your party, only to sell it all 15 minutes later when you get to the next town and buy the next best thing. That would only incentivize players to skip entire tiers of equipment to avoid the hassle. I would be frustrated if I was suddenly forced to mine Copper before I was able to get Iron equipment, or make steel before I could mine diamonds. But if those equipment sets gave me an advantage that Iron or Diamond couldn't, I might pursue them despite their lower stats.</p>\n<p>If the game shifted to allowing side-grades of armor, with different pros and cons coming with each, it might make the player's choice of equipment in a vast sea of options more meaningful.</p>",

Because if that's not what you meant, I would prefer it that way better, and right now using a shield on the offhand you use crouch, and the rest of dual wielding for other items on touch shouldn't be that hard to do because when ever you mine blocks, you touch and hold, even if it's instant mine like a torch, and placing blocks you always tap. The only problem is with doing consumables in offhand and mining tool in main hand. But actually, all you need to do is add the offhand slot to Minecraft Bedrock and in those situations, even if you're close enough to mine something, to eat or drink instead you can press and hold the consumable in the offhand, (and you would still be able to look around at the same time if you drag your finger while it still is held down on the screen) and that is how you would do that instead of mining.</p>",

I ran for the tower and ran inside... the first time having no idea what to expect, but figuring it was a fun way to start. I found the door easily and took one hit on the run to get there. I ran up the stairs and no one was inside the tower waiting. Those giving chase were not close enough behind to get a shot off as I wound up the stairs. At the top, I turned and used the dirt to block the stairs. I then had all the time in the world to loot the chest as they grunted beneath me. I turned to go and had to drop from the tower, but probably should have just run through them.<br><br>The second time was even easier. I cased the place from a distance (they patrol and will attack if you are too close) and found the entrance in advance. I got a good line on the door and ran for it. No damage. Same deal, got the loot, and this time there's a pond beneath me, so I just run off the top of the tower. No damage at the bottom. One of them gave chase for a long time and got two hits, but I emerged unscathed and healed with the food I just stole from the tower chest along with the rest of the loot that included a crossbow and some other good starter stuff.<br><br>In other words... yes, I like your idea. No, I don't think it's much of a task to get the top of the tower if it can be done at the very beginning of a game.</p>",

I think that instead of pillagers randomly spawning around the terrain of the outpost, there should be a finite count of them associated with it. Perhaps 50 would be a good number? After they are defeated, the outpost is yours, to destroy or repurpose.</p>\n<p>Pillager outposts add something fun and challenging to the game. But I don't think the pillagers themselves should be randomly blinking on and off like the ghoulish nighttime mobs of skeletons and zombies. Somehow that feels wrong. It makes them seem less like human entities and more like, well, just random generated mobs. With a finite count of pillagers in the forts, we have a pathway to victory and closure.</p>\n<p>As fun as the pillagers are, it's actually pointless to engage with them. We need a reason to interact with pillager outposts. There needs to be a way to conquer them, even if it's really hard to do so. That would encourage the player to strategize the best way to topple the towers and even repurpose them, if desired. As it stands now, I just ignore the outposts, having learned what I did about them. After all, what's the point?</p>\n<p>This needs to change in Minecraft.</p>",

Right now there seems to be no point in attacking the Pillager Outposts- the pillagers just respawn, so you can't really 'beat' it, and for better players, the loot isn't that good. Granted, you might want to free the Iron Golems and just burn down the whole place- (Speaking of which, I am all for a little villager prison inside the outpost- that would provide more motivation to attack, and free them)- but honestly, it is just a big waste of time if they just keep respawning. Here's my general thoughts:</p>\n<p>1. Have a special banner or block in the center of the top story of the tower. When a player claims it, pillagers stop spawning. The pillagers prevously spawned do not despawn. This would make it so that a player still has to fight to take the outpost, not just be fast and grab the banner.</p>\n<p>2. I definitely agree with the raid idea. It can't be a true war if we can't fight for certain positions! That requires being able to conquer the outposts- and for the pillagers to be able to take it back. The raid would likely have to be different, since right now they are designed to slaughter innocents in wooden villages. I'm not sure if the Illagers should win if enough of them get into the tower or if they just drive the player(s) away. I like the getting into the tower idea pretty good, because then the player can't just hole up in the top story with their wheat farm and just wait out the raid; they would have to actively fight to keep the Illagers out of the main tower.</p>",

If they spawn within a certain distance of the outpost, they might try to send one of the illagers back to the tower to put the banner back, while the rest hold you off. This could trigger a mini-raid or some adverse event, if they succeed in replacing their banner. If you didn't want illagers to spawn, but don't mind the patrols, you could just destroy the Bannerhold.

On contrary, skins that were already made by other developers can stay on you like how it stays when you play minecraft Earth, Minecraft PE, and Minecraft Switch Edition. I kind of get bored with others skins, I like being creative and make my own skins, it get's annoying when my skin doesn't pop up on minecraft Earth or on the Switch, I would then have to scroll around for 30 min that has a skin that I like... I just like being different. I know you guys already added the minecraft design your player thing. But I miss using my own skin whenever I play on the switch. Thank you.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Add extremely rare small structures that can generate (Random 1x2 mines with torches, connected to nothing, small sand towers nearish to the coasts, etc.) Something that can spawn, but not so often that you maybe even see one every game. Have a chance for a non-legible name tag to momentarily spawn in an open space at least 20 blocks away from the player, and only momentarily. At the very edge of the render distance, set a minuscule chance for his player model to spawn, before vanishing. Don’t make him hostile, he never was to start. And don’t make it a regular occurrence. Make it super-rare. And most importantly, DO NOT NOTATE when you add him. Make it so the players can’t POSSIBLY know that he was added. Let it unnerve them as they play. Even if this was tested as a seasonal thing for October, to see reception by the community. Bring it back, but legit this time. </p>",

For example, a wand that can be charged using XP in order to cast offensive spells, or perhaps a single-use piece of paper similar to the spell scrolls from ES. Or maybe papers/other items, trinkets etc. could be used for utility spells.</p>\n<p>The other idea was a magic system entirely different from but somewhat similar to the enchanting table, being able to \"learn\" a spell for a limited number of casts. Either way I would expect offensive spellcasting to be a limited-use thing reliant on exp.</p>\n<p>I hadn't thought of it but I really like the idea of using some form of ritual as suggested earlier. For example, creating some sort of sigil on the ground and burning(?) it or something in order to charge a wand/staff or regain casting ability, etc. Maybe in addition to using exp at a table of sorts?</p>\n<p>Edit: Another idea, if implemented, maybe the damage or usefulness of spells could be inversely proportional to the quality of armor equipped? Just a thought.</p>",

We also know players can tap into the power of potions and enchanting. Souls are also used in Minecraft dungeons as magical energy. Imagine what sort of stories players could create if these mechanics were expanded on in the base game. Survival builders could make so many different designs for building around different systems. \n<br />What if lapis combine with soul sand and perhaps the potion ingredient could create throw able projectiles. Not necessarily potion effects, but what if soul sand + plus lapis + a fire charge or blaze powder gave you a flaming projectile the player can actually throw. Maybe a splash potion of healing plus some other ingredient could make a throw able instant health projectile with a farther throwing range.\n<br />I know some of these ideas may sound a little bit modded, but as long as it sticks with in the one action/one block at a time model, I don’t think it could be too busted or difficult for other players to follow what you’re doing.\n<br />Maybe there could also be more mobs with different magic resistances or sensitivities like we do now with witches and the undead.</p>",

I do believe that if we were to update this there would have to be a limit to where we stay in the realm of Minecraft and going into making a completely different game than what the core of this game is. But also going to Little with an update like this could make the game feel less customizable. Finding the right balance between those would be desirable. This would make the game more so whimsical</p>",
