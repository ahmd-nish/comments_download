But I think it could be done more believably if it was done via enchanting rather than by using different ores. In reality a gold bucket would melt much faster than an Iron bucket when holding lava and making them from different materials wouldn't increase their internal volume. But by having the ability to enchant buckets you could&nbsp;have more ways to balance the game regarding the use of buckets.&nbsp;For example enchantments could include:</p>\n<p>unmelting (which would mean you actually need this enchantment before you can carry&nbsp;any lava)</p>\n<p>unbreaking (this is needed to get your bucket back after being used to fuel a furnace with lava)</p>\n<p>capacity&nbsp;1,2,3 and 4 (which increases the buckets capacity to 8,16,32 and 64 respectively)</p>\n<p>bottomless (a rare enchantment only granted after combining many capacity 4 buckets but which gives you infinite source blocks. Gather one lava and you'll have infinite lava blocks (when combined with unmelting). Gather 1 water and you'll have infinite water source blocks. Gather 1 fish in a bucket and you'll have infinite fish to fill your aquarium. You'll also have the ability to empty large parts of the nether of lava by being able to gather infinite lava source blocks (when combined with unmelting) Note that lava obtained from/within this bucket would probably need a different ID so that it cannot be used to power a furnace, either by placing the bucket in a furnace or filling other buckets, but otherwise would be identical. Or perhaps maybe we should be able to fuel a furnace with it?</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Allow me to streamline your idea.\n<br />So, instead of unmelting we could just use fire resistance on buckets as well as armor.\n<br />I love capacity but it seems a bit too op so we will just lower those maximum source block numbers and that’s all good. And bottomless? I think that is just SO cool, but instead of that weird combining thing you mentioned it could just be found in buried treasure (although very rarely) \n<br />ALSO the fire resistance needed to pick up lava would be great because it could prevent players from getting that cheaty diamondless nether portal.\n</p>",

Having 32 would be similar to having 36 buckets in an inventory full of buckets. Or do you think it should be less than that? Of course what I really want is a bottomless bucket haha but I agree it would have to be hard to get. It's not really OP, you can get infinite water in the ocean an infinite lave from caves/the nether. It's just a massive time saver. I like the idea of finding it in buried treasure. It would be like finding some magical lost artifact that once belonged to the one that built the nether, but it now belongs to you! So much story possibilities from just a bucket lol!</p>",

When many players are on a server, sleep barely happens meaning phantoms are a big problem when it gets later on into their spawning patterns in big groups. Many players say they are more annoying than dangerous in this situation so creating a sleep potion is a balanced way of fixing this but I think there is an even better solution.</p>\n<p>Rather than removing or tweaking the way phantoms spawn a potion that resets the time until they come could be useful although a potion just for this problem doesn't fit into the generic themes of the other potions and seems a bit overkill for a problem like this. I think it would be better to implement a pause on the phantom timer with night vision potions. This would give night vision potions a boost of use as they don't seem to be used that much. Using night vision potions also would be easier to fit into the lore of the creatures as they are a phantom which feeds off of insomnia which night vision potions have a lot in common with.</p>",
