I tend to think of them (in Minecraft) as machines (the legend is matter animated). If you were to treat them as matter animated then it may make sense to use a \"Totem of Undying\" lapis lazuli and emeralds (I say lapis because if you watch game theory he tries to look into the illagers and the woodland mansion and the topic of lapis comes up).</p>\n<p>On the topic of protecting villages the snow golem can only be spawned by the player, this being one of two golems, I don't think it is fare to state that golems as a whole protect villages.</p>\n<p>And if more golems are added (I for one want a ranged golem that does damage) the an even larger group of them could be found outside of villages furthering my previous point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
