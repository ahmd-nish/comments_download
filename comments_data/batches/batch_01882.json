Is true that this might be balanced if players go to the pale gardens every time they want resin. But most players will go to the pale gardens once and grab just one heart of resin, then a bunch of wood and saplings. This is possible to do without even letting the sun set (assuming your lucky), then they go back to base and create a safe environment and place the heart there. Now you get infinite resin without any danger.</p>\n<p>I would suggest you make coating an item in resin a less powerful option, like perhaps instead of making your amor more durable it reduces knock back, but it breaks vary fast.
