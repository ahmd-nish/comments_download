It also allows for some interesting mechanics.<br><br>&nbsp;For example, slimes don't have a head, so it will be impossible to do criticals on them with bows/crossbows, therefore making them slightly resilient to them (which makes sense, their jelly body won't suffer much structural damage from pierce attacks, and is much more vulnerable to slicing). Magma cubes on the other hand, although don't have a head, have a nucleus that is exposed while it's jumping, so maybe you can shoot an arrow in it's nucleus while it's mid-air to cause critical damage.</p>",
