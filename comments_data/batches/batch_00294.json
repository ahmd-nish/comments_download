I own a Java based, building server, we specialize in true mega-builds and one of the most talked about thing on our server over the past 6 years from many players is that there is a need for vertical slabs to make more realistic window and door trim, that, and the ability to place two different types of half slabs on top or in this case next to each other to make these vertical half slabs useful. I am new here and don't want to be banned, but what is wrong with suggesting vertical slabs, even if they had to be turned with something like a stick piston type of machine. The slabs already exist, let us manipulate them? I thought this was a place for suggestions for upcoming versions of the game. Thank you for your time, from someone who wants new content, yet wants to keep the mega builds that have been built over the past 6 years. If I have overstepped my bounds, I am truly sorry.</p>",
