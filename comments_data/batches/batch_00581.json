Imagine setting up zip line access points all over a cliff base to zip up and down to higher or lower area in a flash. You can add a redstone powered pulley system to crank you up a zip line to a higher location, or use the grappling hook to create a new upward line. The grappling hook should have a limit to its distance, say 10-20 blocks, which would require you to build connection areas. Perhaps add anchors or a type of belay system that would be needed to set up the connection area to extend the zip lines over greater distances. This would be incredibly fun while exhilarating because of the fall chance. This idea is a must!</p>",
