The dog would automatically choose a bed when one is placed near him and that would be the \"anchor point\" for when he is ordered to patrol the area. I think this concept is similar to how currently Villager works with their beds, right?</p>\n<p>Plus, i think several of the fox behavior could be \"copied\" to either untamed and tamed dogs. Carrying a item in the mouth, for example, could also be a very interesting thing to implement on dogs's follow mode, to when we are carrying them on exploration and run out of space on inventory we could use then as a single-slot portable inventory. Also dogs could emulate the allay (and sniffers) feature of be ordered to search a specific item/block, and when found would grab the found items (over a full slot) to the owner. Althrough i mentioned Allays and Sniffers due to its similar behaviors, i wrote this idea more inspired by Fallout 3/NV's Dogmeat, that is able to get items for his owner as well.</p>",

For example, they can't be bred unless you have a dragon egg in your inventory. I am not sure. Mojang should then make it so you can get more dragon eggs legitimately.</p>",

I think they still have a vestigial barb on their tail, but it's not a threat to people. \n<br />That aside, a purpose to give a manta ray mob could be to befriend a manta and have it intimidate aquatic hostile mobs like the drowned and normal guardians. The manta won't actually attack these mobs, just keep them at bay solely with its large size. I don't know how you would befriend a manta, maybe add plankton as an item you can feed them with? \n<br />That aside, maybe there can be a very rare variant of mantas that's pink like the one that was found near Australia. Also just to give them some more flare, mantas sometimes jump out of the water in real life, so these manta mobs could do the same at random. </p>",
