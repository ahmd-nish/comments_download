One thing that I have been curious about is if we could include items that we could actually make nods to different cultures. I always have wondered if we would ever include rice as a possible crop in Minecraft. I feel like there are a lot of potential ideas for how to prepare these things with just the current list of food items that we have, and it could also include items that we add. I have been under the impression that rice is grown in the water of a paddy. (I do hope I am spelling that right.) Maybe we could use less space if the water in our farms could be used to grow the rice. With all the different rice dishes that exist in our world for real, we could definitely make a few dishes if the programming is added if rice were included. Using vegetables could make a pilaf, raw fish could actually be a possibility for sushi and with the beets we might make a spicy rice, but if it were a food and/or crop update we could make peppers of some kind for that. Interestingly enough, I think you could include that each pepper does a half a heart of damage since so many people seem to like it when it burns. (So weird to say, but true.) We already have milk in Minecraft and it might be cool to be able to make cheese or butter from it somehow.&nbsp; I don't know if it would be just cheese, but it may even produce a new tradesmen.</p>",

As a wolf/dog, anything other than meat fills less hunger than it would for other mobs.</p>\n<p>-As an Enderman, you can teleport a certain distance and, like horses, walk up blocks. Water hurts you unless you have Water Breathing.</p>\n<p>-If you turn on an option called \"Pure Chaos,\" you and others can choose a boss mob. As the Ender Dragon, you'll spawn in the End, and you'll have a \"Dimensional Rift\" ability that will let you enter other dimensions. The Dragon's block destruction could be kept, I think; that's why it's limited to Pure Chaos, though maybe it could just have the destruction removed if Pure Chaos is off.</p>\n<p>-As a flying mob (besides the Dragon and Ghast), maybe flying could drain your hunger faster.</p>\n<p>-You could even be a Vex.</p>\n<p>Also, maybe an item that lets you change your species could be added, but it'd be exclusive to these worlds and be very hard to obtain.</p>\n<p>That's all, I hope this sounds cool :)</p>",
