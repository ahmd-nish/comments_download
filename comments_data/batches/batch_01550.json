However, the warped forest is making this process way easier not only because of the increased spawnrate, but also because of the environment. Netherack is way to easy to break compared to stone and end stone, and endermen can't even pick them up. Not only that, there are not terrain destroying mobs like ghasts and creepers in this biome, no 1 or 2 block tall mobs that can reach wherever you can go, and no ranged mobs that can shoot you through tiny holes. All you have to do now is just quickly dig a hole on the wall for less than a second and scan across the forest to lure in the mobs that can't even fit in your hole. This is a major change in speedrunning strategies and should therefore, be changed. Maybe endermites would be the better alternative. Magma cubes could also be a good replacement since they don't have a designated spawn area yet.&nbsp;</p>",

Which means that the could come to your crops and make them grow faster. \n<br />Did you know that bats also eat bees? I’d love to see a bat attacking a hive at night. He will only kill one bee, but he’ll also stop by and pollinate the area. \n<br />At last, I’d love to have a mob that takes a grown crop and replants it, while leaving you the food it grown.
