What you've described is pretty different in design from the Warden, but the concept of listening for \"prey\" could definitely be inspiring and spark a lot of ideas, in this case how the Sculk and Warden work and appear adapted to their surroundings.

        "body": "<p>I love the idea of a skeleton wolf (partly because I loved dantdm’s skeletal dog Grimm so much). My suggestion is that they could be found in the nether soul sand valley biome prehaps (though I think I like your lightning strike idea better)</p>\n\n<p>I would love the skeletal wolf to take damage from healing potions and be healed by poison like other undead mobs. I also think that it would be cool if they behave like the skeleton horses (meaning they can both survive in sunlight and run around underwater and not drown because they don’t have lungs lol)</p>\n\n<p>I also love the idea of there being a “wither” skeleton wolf version. This version could be created by breeding two skeleton wolves at a nether fortress (making it cool, rare and something fun to collect for long term survival players like the rare blue and orange axolotl). I feel like the wither skeleton wolf should give the wither effect to anything it attacks (like how a wither skeleton does). Maybe the wither wolf could be immune to lava damage too because it’s a nether mob? Perhaps it also doesn’t take very much damage from the explosive wither skulls that the wither creates as well or have some other bonus that has something to do with the wither ie. confusing/distracting the wither for a few seconds, increasing the damage you do to any wither (or wither skeletons) you attack with it there or being immune from the wither entirely (but that might be way too overpowered).</p>",
