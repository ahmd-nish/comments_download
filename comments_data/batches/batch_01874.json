I agree that the pale oak trees looking the same as dark oak make sense in this case, like a yin and yang or white and black together vibe. However, I think the community would view the addition more favorably if the pale gardens were a completely separate and new biome. I agree with most people that the pale gardens needs more plant-life to be \"garden-like\" and preferably should be a new tree generation to go along with that. Willow trees could look very eerie and creepy with the right environment; either the biome should be completely separate and have a sparse version or it should generate surrounded by a dark oak forest rather than simply on the edge of one (though in both cases I think the tree generation / shape should be changed to be more \"willow-like\").&nbsp;</p>",

You can have a small / slim version that has branches split off similar to the acacia trees (except with more 'branches' that branch out 'wider') and similarly having a mega version of the willow tree with the thick trunks that end up growing taller and having thick branches that then split into thin ones. The mixing of mega thick willow trees with thin small (perhaps slightly curved) willow trees could produce a biome with both a large thick canopy and then also a thinner / sparser sub-canopy. I'd imagine it would feel more dense by having a mixture of tall thick trees with smaller thinner trees. I think you'd truly feel trapped if not only the biome became gray-scale but also there were so many trees that you'd have a hard time finding / seeing the sun.</p>",

It'll be titled 'Even Minecraft trees have lore now!' or something like that. To sum it up, in world generation, a pale garden will only generate adjacent to a dark oak forest (Where woodland mansions generate). Pale gardens are parts of dark oak forests dying and being corrupted from over-harvesting. For once, this doesn't have anything to do with the ancient builders. It was the Illagers! Vindicators, specifically, with their axes. They wanted the resin. The theory suggests that resin is what is used to make the totems of undying. Although it sounds farfetched, there are some things to back up the point.</p>\n<p>Check out the video. Anyway, pale gardens are a PART of the dark oak forests, not an entirely new biome.</p>",

        "body": "<p>We've touched on this before, this is a great idea for an update though there are a handful of ways to make it just that much better.</p>\n<p>1. Biome fog - e.g. that of the nether. A light/dark grey, would also have to be denser than other times fog is used to make the biome feel even more claustrophobic. (Also maybe disable night vision in this biome, it would look horrendous with brightened colours).</p>\n<p>2. Increase mob spawn rates for hostile mobs - Two reasons for this, A. Makes biome for dangerous and would make it stand out to other biomes and B. provide some utility to the biome, being a better place to build mob farms and the like.</p>\n<p>3. We need incentive - The wood is amazing, but frankly its not enough, maybe increased spawn rates of pillager outposts with increased loot (parallel to witch huts). Knowing that mansions spawn in dark oak forests and this is an sub-biome of that some pillager themed structures and loot would work quite well. I really don't know how you would incorporate this but I'm throwing ideas at the wall.</p>\n<p>4. Buff The Creaking - The team was likely going to do this anyway as what we were shown was just a dev build, but it isn't enough of a challenge to be interesting yet.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, loved the update, alonside smaller drops. Honestly, 15 years of updates and still free, you're treating us mojang :D&nbsp;</p>",

First it was Armored Paws, then it was 1.21, and soon we will be getting Bundles of Bravery. And, regarding the new Pale Garden biome, I think it looks really good. It provides an interesting atmosphere, and the new wood type is already my new personal favorite. I can't wait to use it. While this biome does look great so far, I do have some suggestions that could improve it even more:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Biome Fog:</strong> I think adding biome fog to the Pale Garden would help really sell the eerie atmosphere that is has. Making it harder to the player see around them with the help of fog adds some fine challenge to the task of dealing with the creaking.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>A Potential Rename:</strong> The name \"Pale Garden\" makes me picture more of a mystical, fantasy garden or grove. It doesn't really match with the actual look or feeling of the biome from what we've already seen. Maybe a name like \"Pale Forest\" or \"Pale Woods\" would suit it better.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>More Tree Variety:</strong> While I'm sure what we have seen in the Minecraft Live is still a work in progress, I think there should be more variety in the tree sizes and shapes. Right now, the new trees bear a striking resemblance to some other tree types in the game. Instead, what if the pale garden consisted of taller, densely packed trees that cover the skylight?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are just some basic ideas that I just wanted to suggest. And again, I just want to commend Mojang for their hard work. Unlike most of the community, I am really looking forward to this new drop, and I understand the difficulty of not only designing new mechanics, but also the task of implementing them in two different versions of the game.</p>",

The experience and atmosphere would be enhanced by introducing a small variety of native plant life to this area and provides an opportunity for the existing pale moss block to share a similar functionality to its lush counterpart- where introducing bonemeal causes a spontaneous spreading of various plants and overgrowth items. I've also seen a white or pale pumpkin variant as a common wish in the community and it seems like a very fitting addition for a \"spooky\" type of space in the world like this. The warped and crimson biomes in the nether come to mind, which are each overgrown with interesting, alien plants- something like this would help the pale garden further capture the eerie vibe implied.</p>\n<p>This contributes the the risk vs reward experience that seems intended here with a mob designed to introduce an eerie vibe to certain parts of the world, where there would now be more reasons to seek out or visit for items exclusive to an area where a novel danger also lurks.</p>\n<p>For a more imposing atmosphere, the trees could be taller with a more developed, gnarled growth similar to the willow trees that were looked at when conceptualizing the pale oak. This would create a strong distinction from the regular dark oak growth, and allow the biome to stand out from a distance if it were to be seen towering above a natural adjacent forest or swallowing the border of nearby plains.</p>",

I feel like it'd suit the biome wonderfully.<br>I've heard talks of white pumpkins, which would be a wonderful addition for decoration and food!<br>As for a mushroom, I feel like the Enoki or Death Cap mushroom would work well. The Death Cap could inflict poison on the player, maybe once grabbed?<br>I feel like these additions would make this biome feel much more like a garden.

I feel like the biome is a bit too small, at least the ones I found were. The foliage could use some changes as well, like the grass and moss, I feel like the difference in brightness between the two is a bit too noticeable. Could add some new plants/variants as well (perhaps all existing flowers but withered?). You could add some completely new things as well, like, for example, fireflies would fit in really well, not only for ambiance, but to also add more camo for the creaking (glowing eyes). Another cool thing would be to change some things based on the moon phases. For instance, when there is a full moon, make the creaking have a bigger range around their hearts, make them hit harder and make them faster, or something similar. Great features so far and can't wait to see how you improve them and what new features get added/changed. Ly Mojang &lt;3</p>",

I love the new wood set, and I'm sure I'll be putting it to good use in my builds.</p>\n<p>Now, I think we have a problem with naming trees \"pale oaks\". The trunk textures are different from plain oak, and I think this Pale Garden update/drop could be a good opportunity to rename both \"pale oak\" and \"dark oak\" to other types of trees.</p>\n<p>Just like I don't call the drowned \"zombie drowned\", just like the bogged has its own name, I think we should give those two types of wood a name to make them feel more unique. Just removing the \"oak\" part of the name would go a long way, since a \"pale wood tree\" would be pretty self-explanatory and effective.</p>\n<p>I wonder if it would be possible to change that small detail since if someone asks me for \"oak wood\" I will now have 3 valid options for their request and if we rename the ones that are not \"plain oak\" to other types of trees, I will be able to identify that the person who asks me for \"oak wood\" is asking me for a specific wood.</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading.</p>",

The heart needs to be renewable with the saplings.</p>\n<p><strong>There's a significant game design issue here. Why would I go here at night? Can't I just use a bed?</strong> There needs to be useful rewards at night other than blocks, not all of us are Hermitcraft builders. We need meaningful additions that integrates with existing content, like vines spawning at night, fused with copper on fletching tables to create hookshots, this also enhances the gameplay of exploration.</p>\n<p><strong>The heart is advertised as a redstone tool to guard bases, but it's pointless if it only functions at night.</strong> This could've been a cave biome instead, allowing the Creaking to spawn anytime. A cave forest would be more interesting and scary!</p>\n<p>I appreciate this update as horror content is essential for Minecraft youtubers. But I feel like as many others online have said, this update feels underwhelming. I hope for bigger updates next time like ender/aether/sculk dimension, as these will create youtube hype for years. This biome feels like it should've been part of an End update. Next year will be very competitive with sandbox games like GTA6, youtubers/streamers will gravitate there, but I hope Minecraft content can keep up with better updates!</p>",

        "body": "<p>Honestly, I’m not a fan of the new Minecraft update. To me, the Pale Garden and the Creaking feel like something out of modded Minecraft rather than a creation from Mojang. The Pale Garden comes across as a replica of the dark oak biome, but with a washed-out, pale aesthetic that doesn’t feel distinct enough. While the developers have mentioned that they took inspiration from the willow tree for its eerie vibe, I don’t think it captures that feeling well at all. And why call it a garden when there is nothing garden about it? It’s definitely more of a forest.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Creaking mob is a unique and interesting addition, and I can see its potential in the game. However, in its current form, it doesn’t feel dangerous enough to add any real challenge. The mob only deals about a heart of damage and moves too slowly to pose a real threat. I’d love to see it become a more menacing adversary.</p>\n<p>One positive aspect of the update is the addition of the new white wood type, though I do think it looks a bit too pink for my liking. I also wish there was more depth to the biome itself. Adding new flower types or some other unique elements could bring more character to the Pale Garden and make it stand out.</p>\n<p>Overall, I’m not overly impressed with this update. While there are some cool ideas, I think they could be refined further to feel more like authentic Minecraft additions.</p>",

These \"random\" sounds could distract the player, giving more opportunities for the creaking and making the experience more immersive.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A more characteristic mob: This idea revolves around the creaking. Here, more animations could be added, including static animations (like freezing in place to avoid alarming the player). Additionally, it could be interesting if the creaking doesn't react to its surroundings, for example, if an explosion doesn't change its position or if a water current doesn't affect it, making it more imposing. Lastly, the creaking could reach its goal with players (which is to get close to them). How? Simple: by climbing or scaling blocks to reach players in high places and crawling to find hidden players (this could also add more animations).&nbsp;</p>",

No other mobs OR frozen mobs: Whilst playing, the Creaking coming out of the tree was insanely creepy, and the terrible feeling of not being able to watch my own back - but that was ruined by zombies, creepers, and skeletons coming along. For those more experienced with the game, hostile mobs are more annoying than scary. It ruined the immersion. Something similar to the Ancient City would make the garden more quiet and give that sense of \"wrongness.\"&nbsp; OR, a creepier idea - make the mobs merely stand there and stare at you. There eyes follow, but they're almost ... dead... like the forest has taken them over.</p>\n<p>2. Buff The Creaking and make it even faster when you're looking away. The ambience and sound effects are amazing for both the biome and the mob.</p>\n<p>3. Make it impossible to sleep in this biome. You have to survive the night. <em>Stuck in your house</em><em>, forced to listen to the noises outside - pray you don't make eye contact through the window. Ignore the knocking. Don't let them in.</em></p>\n<p>4. Pale flowers, and other things people have mentioned, like the white pumpkins.</p>\n<p><strong>Things I love:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sound effects and the ambience.</li>\n<li>The eyes - the only differing color in the biome. If fireflies or firefly particles could be added, this would make it even creepier - are those eyes? Or bugs?</li>\n<li>Wearing a pumpkin head allows you to watch them move - Love it.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Possible bonus joke: Make it so you can strip them with an axe just like logs XD</p>",

There are a few things that I would love to see implemented.</p>\n<p>1. Biome Fog: It's been mentioned a lot in this thread already, but is definitely worth repeating: having a really dense biome fog would be so helpful in creating a dense forest where danger could be lurking at every turn</p>\n<p>2. Mob spawning: I feel like mob spawning needs to be limited to certain mobs. It was really fun walking through the pale garden at night, and I love that it feels completely different from any other biome, but the immersion broke whenever I saw a creeper or a zombie because that bright green stands out so much. Spawning should be limited to just the mobs that have a desaturated color palette, such as the skeleton or spider, as they blend in better with the biome.</p>\n<p>3. Azaela Trees: On a similar note to the above point, when an azalea tree spawns in the pale garden it really stands out as a very bright green. While I love that azaela leaves don't change color based on biome, I feel like they might have to in this one biome. To me, it would also give some deeper meaning behind the biome, like it's sucking all of the color out of the blocks</p>\n<p>Again, I really love this biome so far and how it gives a completely different feel to the game. I already have so many ideas of what I can build in my ongoing survival world when the update comes out!</p>",

This is great, play it up! De-saturate the dirt, introduced plants/trees, and lighting in the biome if possible. Lilly of the valley, white tulip, oxeye daisy would look nice here, maybe some mushrooms. Especially a new mushroom growing on the trees, like turkeytail mushrooms. Maybe shape the trees to more closely resemble the Creaking.<br>The Creaking should have different heights, like slimes. <br>A white flame as a light source would be neat, maybe through a new powder that is made from a new flower, mushroom, or white dye + glow ink.<br><br>I look forward to this update!</p>",

        "body": "<p>This is a possible issue I realized while looking at seeds with new biome. If I understand correctly the Pale Garden seems to spawn at the locations of the Dark Forest, exclusively. The Dark Forest is a kind of rare biome. Sometimes we need to travel thousands of blocks away from spawn to find any. And on top of that its Pale Garden variant doesn't spawn at every location of the Dark variant. So, it might be really rare and difficult, to even find a Pale Garden.</p>\n<p>So, my suggestion on how to fix this potential issue is to always have a part of any Dark Forest spawn as Pale one. This way you increase the chances of find it, and also, you will have a secure way to locate it using the woodland mansion maps. However, that fix might not be enough. So, I suggest having the Pale Garden spawn at more locations away the Dark Forest biome.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

I have a few suggestions that I think would really improve the pale garden and make it a more enjoyable/terrifying place for players to explore.</p>\n<p>I'd like the pale garden to feel a little more alien. I feel like it currently feels like a reskinned dark forest, and I think a few simple changes could fix that:</p>\n<p>1) Desaturate it even more. Make it actually gray, not gray green. Also, desaturate that dirt. The brown dirt messes with the faded effect, in my opinion.</p>\n<p>2) Make the trees taller and thinner, more \"willowy.\"</p>\n<p>I also feel like it doesn't quite fit the name Pale Garden. While some people say that it should simply be renamed to \"Pale Forest\" because of this, I think that leaning into the \"Garden\" idea could be really rewarding and create a very interesting atmosphere, creating a truly unique biome. Here are some of my thoughts on how to do that:</p>\n<p>1) Make the leaves of the trees lighter, like a white or light gray.</p>\n<p>2) Add some new plants! I've seen some people who have had ideas for plants that create mist, plants that imitate creaking noises, or white roses. I love all of these suggestions and would like to see at least two or three new plants.</p>\n<p>3) A new structure would be really cool. While some people think that a graveyard structure would be cool, I'd prefer a \"faded conservatory\" structure. It could be guarded by an absurd number of creaking, but have some interesting reward inside.</p>\n<p>No matter what the final outcome is, I'm so excited for this new game drop. Have a great day!</p>",

When you walk through them it should sound like a twig snapping.</p>\n<p><strong>- Pale Pumpkins.</strong> White pumpkins like the one from Minecraft: Story Mode, could be carved of course, and would fit the spooky theme... Could be crafted into soul fire jack-o-lanterns perhaps?).</p>\n<p><strong>- Pale Rose.</strong> A bleached white flower that resembles a rose... Kinda like a white wither rose. Could be crafted into white dye.</p>\n<p><strong>- White Mushrooms.</strong> If the biome is supposed to be a variant of the Dark Forest, then <em>commit to the bit.</em> It should have little button-cap mushrooms, and giant white mushrooms unique to the biome! :D</p>\n<p><strong>- Shelf Fungus.</strong> Could grow on the sides of the trees.</p>\n<p><strong>- Frog Blossom.</strong> Kinda like the Spore Blossom, but instead of spores it attracts orange Fireflies.</p>",

It would feel a lot less jarring to the landscape, and have it feel like a secluded sub-biome.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Atmospheric Fog </strong>Next, biome fog would give it a good atmosphere. It would make it feel dimmer and denser, even in the it the daytime due to that, and would really help the creaking mob to stand out. (Its eyes would really glow through the fog in a neat way).</li>\n<li>\n<strong>More Diversity </strong>It also needs some sort of something special to the biome. For a \"Pale Garden,\" it feels a lot like a \"Pale Graveyard,\" which I do like, however even at that, it still needs something more unique. It feels very flat with just trees and moss, as we already have them in plenty of other biomes.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Obstacles </strong>Some obstacles similar to sweet berries would make gameplay more interesting. This could be by dead bramble bushes, or cobweb-like undergrowth to make running traversing this particular biome more challenging.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Structures </strong>Some sort of unique structure. Finding an abandoned garden, statue, or even grave, (Perhaps a mausoleum, this could act as a mini dungeon?) would add plenty of atmosphere, and up the spook factor by quite a bit.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Atmosphere </strong>Last but not least, some sort of distraction/jump-scare to put you more on edge without relying only on the creaking, yet could also add some more \"false alarms,' hyping up the mob a bit more. This could be something that resembles the creaking's eyes, something that sound similar to the creaking, and of course a classic, some sort of snapping twigs. (The snapping twigs could also be repurposed by players as some sort of trap/alert system, giving a cool new mechanic, and reason to explore for the biome.)</li>\n</ul>",

Examples: tiny, transparent will-o-wisps or subtle, intermittent environmental noises like aeolian sounds or soft almost whispers.</p>\n<p>Maybe the mushroom block would have a custom noteblock sound, like the almost sigh you hear from soul sand.

Ruins: </strong>The \"Garden\" part of the biome name implies that this is a place that has been purposefully planted and tended, at least to some extent. Adding ruins throughout the Garden--crumbled walls, collapsed terraces, remains of paths that lead nowhere--could add a haunting feeling to the biome. Additionally, these ruins could be places to find suspicious gravel, adding incentive for players to stay a while and dig for treasure, such as new pottery sherds, armor trims, or banner patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Biome Variation: </strong>As other users have pointed out, adding fog to further obscure vision, making the trees taller/a different shape, and adding some flowers, mushrooms, or similar vegetation could add to the visual interest of the biome. (Sidenote, I absolutely love how the Pale Moss grows up the block faces around it, I think that is very cool and unique and I am so excited to use it)</p>\n<p><strong>3. Mob Encounters: </strong>I think the Creaking is so cool and unique, and right now it feels a little too easy to avoid. Making it impossible to sleep through the night in this biome could help force encounters with the Creaking, and add even more of a menacing feel to the biome as a whole.</p>\n<p>All in all, I love what I have seen of the Pale Garden so far, and I am so excited to see how it continues to develop!</p>",

        "body": "<p>Interesting biome and I like the idea. Here are some ideas I think would enhance the 'eerie' feeling:</p>\n<p>- No other mobs naturally spawning in it. Why? They distract from the feature you should focus on: the new creaking mob; and break the immersion of the biome's atmosphere. It goes from eerie and creepy to just annoying by the sheer amount of zombies/skeletons/creepers &amp; spiders chasing you. There's not even a bit of time to dedicate to the creaking because of this.</p>\n<p>- Higher creaking spawn rate. Either this or increase their radius from the heart. reasoning: more of them chasing you.</p>\n<p>- Creaking mobs avoiding making a line. The reasoning is simple for this one: make them try to avoid clumping into a blob/line, so they circle you more effectively. This makes it so you have to turn around to look at all of them, which in turn gives others chances to attack and move.</p>\n<p>- Make them teleport you short distances when hitting you, akin to a chorus fruit (but without the sound), to disorient you &amp; give other creaking a chance to move. It borrows a bit from Dr.Who and I feel it would fit neatly with how they work.</p>\n<p>- Make their animations pause the instant you look at them so you can't catch them moving by turning around quickly. Also make them pause their animations halfway if they're seen while executing them, so if they attack you, let them have their arm slightly raised until they have another chance to move. This also indicates that they were about to / just hit you.</p>",

One of my favorite items in the game is the spore blossoms (the big pink upside down flower) because it allows me to add a nice particle effect to any of my builds. This flower would be similar, it creates a sort of particle effect that resembles fog. Imagine being able to add fog to any build! Because it generates randomly and uncommonly, players will have to wander around the pale garden for some time trying to find a few, which is the goal of adding an incentive. But it won't be so rare that it takes forever to find just one.</p>\n<p>see my post <strong>Pale Blossom- Fog Emitting Plant</strong> for more details.</p>",

And it also give us things with a practical purpose, wind charges, emeralds, weapons, armor, and the new mace. It's a perfect balance.</p>\n<p>Mining provides you with visual building blocks like stone and deepslate, diorite, granite, and copper. And for a practical purpose it offers ores like coal, iron, gold, redstone, lapis lazuli, and diamond. Its a perfect balance.</p>\n<p>Then there's blocks and items that serve both, these ones are the best because it offers an even more complete balance. Wood is a good example, you need tons of wood for any common build, and you need tons of wood for weapons and all sorts of other practical crafts. Its a perfect balance.</p>\n<p>I could go on but that's of point, as of right now the Pale Gardens have lots of visual rew<em><strong>a</strong></em>rds; white wood, resin, pale moss, and eyeblossoms. But it carries no practical rew<em><strong>a</strong></em>rd other than wood. As a biome with more danger than others, it needs some practical gain.</p>",

Then I would recreate a safe environment where I can farm these materials without any danger whatsoever. I would place the eyeblossoms near my base, and place the Creaking heart in cleared out area. When night comes I get open eyeblossoms, and I can hit the Creaking over and over again, gaining infinite resin, and avoiding all danger. These new items are a step in the right direction, encouraging players too explore at night, but its still easily avoidable.</p>\n<p>I have a few suggestions. Every time you hit the Creaking its damage increases, encouraging you to leave one Creaking and move on to the next to avoid unexpected death. One Creaking heart can only produce a limited amount of resin (maybe 11). Artificial Creaking hearts (player placed Creaking hearts) can only produce 1-2 resin a night. This will encourage players to move from one Creaking to another instead of getting a good position and just standing there all night. The Artificial heart debuff would encourage players too hunt for resin IN THE PALE GARDENS, instead of in a factory.</p>",

I think this adds a nice incentive for players to interact with the creaking. Hopefully we see Resin receive more practical uses in the future either with redstone or something else in the game; while it makes for a good building block as a non-builder it isn't something I'd strive to farm or collect at the moment, but nonetheless I think Resin is a great addition.</p>\n<p>Eye Blossoms are likewise a much appreciated floral block for the biome. I love its closed state and how it almost resembles a white/pale rose. Of course the open state is fantastic at night to provide a bit of camouflage for the creaking. I still would have liked to see a new two-block-tall flower added in the biome, but I'd still be happy to just have the Eye Blossom since it fits in perfectly. Only change I'd make is for the player to permanently set them in either an open or closed state in some way.</p>\n<p>Personally, I'd still prefer for the biome to be it's own separate entity with its own atmosphere/vibes rather than a Dark Oak sub-variant, but I think if you made it resemble the Dark Oak forest more I'd be more accepting of it. Like others said it be great if there were pale variants of existing flora (pumpkins / mushrooms).</p>",

It isn't a bad concept, but the problem is that this is such a great biome at such a small scale; like if your unlucky you'll only find one or two pale oak trees inside a roofed forest, or at the best of times it'll be a smallish clump (~ 50 blocks in diameter) rather than a big rare biome to explore. You could run into a larger Pale Garden of ~100 blocks in diameter, but these are extremely rare (at least in Bedrock). Since a lot of the time you find them on the outskirts of Dark Oak / Roofed Forests the Pale Gardens seem to be underwhelming as a sub-variant.</p>\n<p>Please separate them as their own (similar to what you did with Mangrove Swamps) and develop their own eerie atmosphere/vibe. Like other's said, it'd be great if your visibility was hampered while in the biome (similar to what the bedrock void fog used to do) or if a new flower blossom variant produced fog throughout the biome. It'd also be a missed opportunity to not add pale/white pumpkins to this biome and it's a little unfortunate that the trees aren't more willow-like in their generation pattern. I like the idea of a canopy that resembles the Roofed Forest biome, but it'd be better if there were single sapling and mega sapling variants for the tree generation. Another idea could be a unique passive/tamable mob with a crow or raven bird.</p>",

Someone mentioned the idea of a \"mold\" effect, but that seems a bit too similar to the effect the wither gives. Perhaps it could make your armor weaker, and slow you down? As if you're turning into a wooden statue? (Making it so that players become petrified and leave behind little statues of themselves sounds really cool, actually.)</p>\n<p>Is it possible to make mobs run away from the forest if they accidentally wander in? This would, in my mind, include pets, monsters, and villagers. It's really annoying to have to deal with other nighttime mobs in addition to the Creaking. It takes one's attention away from the main point of the biome. Plus, seeing monsters and your pets start running away from the biome in fear would definitely add to the spook factor.</p>",

Outro recurso também interessante é ser adicionado é mais flores, para enriquecer o bioma e fazer sentido para o nome, já que se chama \"Jardim pálido\" algumas dessas flores poderiam ser de 2 blocos de altura, aumentando a variedade. Outra coisa muito legal também seria adicionar alguns cogumelos, já que o bioma de Carvalho escuro possui, esses cogumelos poderiam ser de coloração pálido e alguns com detalhes que imitam os olhos do creaking, eles poderiam ser na versão pequena e na versão gigante também. Corujas e corvos dariam um ar de mais assustador e macabro para o bioma, com sons autênticos e sons de bateção de asas. E para finalizar ter um sapo de coloração pálida (cinza) especifico desse bioma, ele pode comer o cubo de magma e dropar uma luz pálida cinza ou esbranquiçada.</p>",

        "body": "<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: small;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Though the Pale Garden’s grayed-out sky is atmospheric, it is the wrong feel for the Overworld. Instead of giving a feel that fits the Overworld, it instead feels as if I have stepped into another dimension. But because this biome is still in the Overworld, it doesn’t fit when I walk into the Pale Garden and instead feel like I walked into one of Minecraft’s already existing other dimensions. The Overworld is Minecraft’s hub world that is perfectly designed and balanced to feel like the ‘real’ world, and that is thrown out when I walk into a biome that changes the skybox in a way that makes me feel more like I’m in ‘The End’ dimension. This is not only a problem for balancing the atmospheres of all of the game’s three dimensions, all of which have their own design and purpose, but it can also affect the builds of the many players who enjoy making multi-biome builds. With the already existing biomes, it is possible to work around these things because the sky never changes. For example, if a build that started in a plains biome transitions into a desert biome, this is not a huge problem because the sand can be replaced with slightly different colored grass blocks. While it’s true that it will never rain there, the sky still looks the same, making it easier for a large build to transition between biomes. But a build smoothly transitioning to the Pale Garden is impossible with the grayed out skybox, inevitably making part of the build look like it doesn’t belong in the Overworld.</span></span></span></p>",

My suggestion is, in addition to the base damage, in its <em><strong>first attack it will cause half of the player's current life</strong></em>, ignoring armor like warden, but without being able to kill, as this depends on the current life, it will not always kill, but it will always give a scare.<br><br><strong>2- Climb and Cross Blocks</strong>: To correct the idea of ​​blocking the monster with blocks or digging underneath it, since it is similar to trees, it could <strong>have the gift of roots</strong>. Just <strong>like Spiders and Silver Fish, it could climb/cross,</strong> mainly blocks of land and trees. As a plus, perhaps leaving him hidden inside the blocks during the day would be interesting.<br><br><strong>3- Stalker Strategy: </strong>Possibly the most difficult mechanic, but more interesting. After he had carried out an attack on the player, he would hide for a random time, to finally carry out another powerful attack, and it was not easy for the character to keep looking back and tracking his safe position. To do this, after his first attack, the next time the player loses sight he would gain a<strong> random invisibility time (from 6 to 20 seconds for example) and would remain stil</strong>l, then return to his normal mode to carry out another attack. It changes the dynamics a little,<strong> leaving the player lost and paranoid.</strong></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I personally think that, especially with the recent previews/betas/snapshots, the Pale Gardens is one of the most immersive biomes in the Overworld, besides the Deep Dark. That being said, the Pale Gardens has what I call, an \"immersion problem.\"&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The main strength of the Pale Garden is that it immerses the player into the experience, as previously mentioned, however, at night, the constant spawning of \"basic mobs,\" like creepers, skeletons, zombies, etc. detract from that sense of atmospheric horror by interrupting the player's sense of dread.</p>\n<p>In order to fix this immersion problem, removing all the basic mobs, or at the very least, reducing the amount of them could help amend the problem. One might content that by doing so, the danger of the Pale Gardens is reduced- a notion with which I would agree with. This means that two fixes are in order: removing/reducing mob spawns, AND increasing the amount of, speed of, and damage output of Creaking in order to compensate for the lack of mob attacks.</p>\n<p>Improving the mob spawns and Creaking in this way heightens the immersion and gives the Pale Garden a truly unique experience to offer that is unlike any other in the Overworld.</p>\n<p>Thank you Mojang.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>TLDR: Remove/reduce mob spawns, increase speed, damage, and amount of Creaking in order to fix immersion detraction.</p>",

If you want it to be unsettlingly quiet, it's time to add ambience to all the other biomes in the game to underscore the silence in the pale garden. Adding a semi-frequent breeze, birds chirping, a stream babbling, the dawn song at sunrise, the white noise of a waterfall, waves on the beach, crickets and the like (I could go on) throughout the overworld would add a LOT of life and vibrancy to ALL of the game while distinguishing the garden as something different. Adding a gentle band pass filter to player and mob noise (footsteps, using a tool, a cow mooing) while IN the garden could also add to the disquieting and uneasy mood of the pale garden.</p>\n<p>Thank you for the consideration :-)</p>",

It's clear that one of its purposes outside of the Pale Garden is to allow the player to gamify it and do whatever they want with it. I think this is awesome and makes doing minigames like this a lot easier for the player. However, there is a bit to be desired in terms of what the player can control with The Creaking. As it stands, it looks like The Creaking doesn't do very much damage, which is fine for hunting for Creaking Heart Blocks, but not so much for making mini-games with it. Since the Creaking Heart Block requires wood to surround parts of it in order to spawn The Creaking, using other wood types besides the Pale Oak could lead to a lot of interesting differences with The Creaking. Here's a few ideas I had:<br><br>Birch Wood - The Weeping Angel behavior is inverted, attacks you when looked at and doesn't move otherwise</p>\n<p>Cherry Wood - Completely pacifies the mob</p>\n<p>Mangrove Wood - Mob will always try to attack the player</p>\n<p>Dark Oak Wood - The mob will do twice the regular damage</p>\n<p>Oak Wood - The mob moves faster</p>\n<p>Acacia Wood - The mob moves slower</p>\n<p>Spruce Wood - The mob's attacks ignores armor</p>\n<p>Jungle Wood - The mob can link to multiple Creaking Heart Blocks</p>\n<p>Crimson Hyphae - The mob's attacks inflicts fire damage</p>\n<p>Warped Hyphae - The mob's attacks inflict slowness</p>\n<p>I understand this would be a lot of work texturing and programming wise, but I feel like it could be a fun addition to the mob and be really fun to experiment with!</p>",

This \"challenge\" however can be easily stopped with a bed. Why would I go here at night? There's a massive game design issue that needs to be fixed here. Mojang wanted new features to integrate with existing ones, but this addition is somehow doing the opposite.</p>\n<p>Maybe at night, enchanted twigs can spawn for players to make a wand, hookshot, or jewelry? This creates a tangible reward that can help with exploration, building etc like extended range. Maybe it also require copper and amethyst, which makes new features coexist with old ones? This is how we create meaningful additions that integrate with existing content.</p>\n<p>I'm worried that with these small drops, end update will never happen.

Here are my thoughts:</p>\n<p>1.The Creaking is not camouflaged very well: Since the creaking will usually be turned towards you after it has walked towards you, I was always able to see its bright eyes. This made it trivial to see in most cases. For this it might help to have the mob have its eyes usually closed, and only open them occasionally.</p>\n<p>2.I always knew when a creaking had spawned due to their easily noticeable spawning sounds. Due to this I usually knew that one was close by and was never surprised by one.</p>\n<p>3.The main threat in the pale garden were still normal hostile mobs. The creaking is not a huge threat by itself. The creaking instead serves to make the other hostile mobs more difficult to deal with, as it restricts where you can look and aim. I quite like this, as it provides a more unique challenge. Despite that I do think the creaking should be more powerful. I was able to ignore the creaking in most cases, as it barely deals any damage. The only problem I had was the knockback when being attacked, while trying to mine the creaking heart. Otherwise it can be easily ignored.</p>\n<p>Overall I really enjoyed my time in the pale garden. Well done, Mojang!</p>\n<p>Slight nitpick: The creeper fells weirdly out of place in this biome, since its color is very different from the ground. Maybe add a creeper variant? It could make the same noises as the creaking to help alleviate the issue from point 2.</p>",

The Creaking is currently very weak, and I believe that increasing its damage would enhance the difficulty and fun of the game. Stronger attacks would not only make battles with it more challenging, but also amplify the sense of fear and tension that players should feel when encountering the Creaking. Increased damage would make the mob more threatening, creating an atmosphere of danger and anticipation, adding more immersion to the gameplay.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. I noticed the Pillager and other mobs from the raid are afraid of the Creaking. This can be used to defend the village. But at the same time, the golem itself tries to attack the Creaking. I think if this idea is developed further, the golem should not be distracted by the new mob. You can make it so that the artificially summoned Creaking will be a little different from the usual one. This can be done in various ways, such as a new craft from a \"Creaking Heart Block\" in order to create a defender Creaking. However, the craft should be complex and unique, bringing more interest and incentive to players before they explore the new biome.</span></p>",

All focus should go onto the creaking, as that's what the whole biome builds up towards. The sounds of the trees creaking are amazing and really build that tension and eeriness, then night falls and you get double teamed by a skeleton and a creeper.</p>\n<p><strong> Doesn't do enough damage</strong> <br>By the time you find a pale forest, chances are you've got a full set of iron armour. Even if you don't, the creaking is not really a threat whatsoever. It'll also help to punish the player for not playing by the new gameplay mechanic. You can just tank all the damage they do and break the heart.</p>\n<p><strong>Too easy to run away from</strong> <br>They're way too slow.

I think this feature could be implemented into the Creaking - my idea is that when you walk next to a Creaking Heart with Bad Omen, it becomes a blue Ominous Creaking Heart. This makes it spawn the Ominous Creaking at night. The Ominous Creaking deals more damage and can disguise itself more easily by closing its eyes. I think it could also be creepier than the regular Creaking mob, by making spookier ambient noises and having blue eyes. This would be a fun expansion of the Ominous Event system!</p>",

        "body": "<p>So here's my overall impressions, and reactions to existing suggestions.</p>\n<p>I think the creaking is reason enough to go to the biome, especially at night. Not every new feature has to change the game balance or be highly incentiveised. I also spent a while trying to locate hearts during the day and it is so much more annoying than just dealing with the creakings. However those who don't already know about the creaking seem unlikely to encounter them naturally, I think simply making the biomes bigger on average would definitely increase the odds of one stumbling on them at night, preferably taking some from nearby biomes and not just replacing more dark oak</p>\n<p>I do belive it should do slightly more damage and/or be faster than the player, even armorless with five of them chasing you they hardly pose a threat. Considering they're easier to avoid than zombies and take up the same mob cap, they should probably at least do similar dps.</p>\n<p>Now, i absolutely adore the \"different woods around the heart activate the creaking differently\" idea, it would satisfy all 3 sides of the player placed heart argument. Even just limiting it to the oaks; dark oak could be daytime spawn(since roofed forest used to spawn mobs during the daytime), classic oak making it attack hostiles, and pale oak makes hostile to player, of course, (maybe you could even mix and match), However I also understand that that could be difficult to do within the holiday deadline.</p>",

I would recommend that the creaking get converted into small particles and those particles either fall to the ground or mix with the Pale Oak logs in the surroundings.</li>\n</ul>\nThese suggestions would make the Creaking one of the most loved mobs in the game\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Here's some ideas to make it more unique.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>It is too easy to run from</strong> The mob should be far faster, so that you actually have to look at it. Right now, you can simply run, and it's too easy.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It is too much like a weeping angle</strong> It lacks some originality. This mob is supposed to be a tree, but it is fire resistant, which doesn't make much sense, and can't be harmed by anything. It would be neat if trying to burn it (Like burning wood) or using an axe on it (Like trying to cut down a tree) would enrage it, causing it to attack no matter what. Then players would have to be more careful, and it would be terrifying if this \"tree\" suddenly ran at you for trying to burn/cut it down. (It should also remain on fire while taking no damage from it if you do try to light it. Then it's attacks would be far worse- You would be chased by a flaming tree!)</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It needs to stay rooted</strong> Right now, if the player isn't looking, the creaking will swim. That should change so it can walk really quickly across the bottom of water. It would make it harder to see it coming and add a creep factor. It is also a bit too easy to move it around, considering that it is supposed to stay linked, water currents should not affect it. After all, water doesn't affect trees, it only submerges them.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>It knows&nbsp;</strong>If you look <em>directly</em> at the creaking, it should close its eyes, like it knows and is trying to blend it, like reverse enderman.</li>\n</ul>",

This could be chopped up by an axe and have some kind of loot, giving the mob some actual purpose.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Too easy to just stare at&nbsp;</strong>Apart from the fact that it is not nearly fast enough, it is also too easy to just stare at. If you stare at it too long, some sort of effect should happen, something along blindness. This would cause the creaking to be able to attack despite which direction the player is looking, so the player would have to be more strategic about it. Something along the line of \"Look and back up- then run- repeat,\" would then become effective as it if it were faster, it would catch up easier, but you can't stare at it for too long. This would provide a fair challenge, and if you wish to escape, your best bet is to come up with a creative approach or try to get out of range.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Again, too easy to escape</strong> Most importantly, the creaking is too easy to trap and escape from. If it finds its path to the player is obstructed (Like when trapped in a pit,) then it could have some sort of way around that. either it being able to \"Root\" to things, and crawl around, or tunneling down into the ground and traveling through its roots to resurface next to the player. This would be terrifying as there would be no easy way to trap and control it.</li>\n</ul>",

So here's a few ideas</p>\n<p>- When the player looks away from the creaking instead of always heading straight for the player to attack it instead has a small chance to hide behind a nearby tree out of sight so that when the player turns around the Creaking has vanished leaving the player in fear of where it vanished too.</p>\n<p>-When there are multiple Creakings in an area have them work together. So if there are two one would attempt to attack the player from the front while the other tries for behind creating predicaments for the player where they have to panic.</p>\n<p>-Have a stalk and a hunt mode, where the creaking sticks by trees and just watches the player not chasing after until the player gets close enough or looks away long enough in which the Creaking then enters its hunt mode and chases down the player.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One other thing I want to say is its far too easy for a player to just run straight by all the creakings and be perfectly fine because they cant catch up without ever having to worry about them, so perhaps add a momentum mechanic to the Creaking? Where the longer the player doesn't look at them the more speed they are able to build up allowing them to catch up a running player who is ignoring them and just running attempting past the Creaking?

I've always wanted a stealth/stalker type mob in the game. the thing is, the creaking in its current state doesn't fully sell that effect.</p>\n<p>there are two small tweaks that would make the creaking truly horrifying.</p>\n<p>1:&nbsp; <strong>closing eyes</strong>: while I do love the idea of turning around and seeing those bright orange eyes in the distance. the fact that they are <strong>so obvious</strong> can take away from the creepiness AND stealth of the creaking.&nbsp; An easy fix would be to<strong> have the creaking shut its eyes one by one when observed.</strong> this would still allow you to maybe catch a glimpse of its eyes, but allow it to blend in if you aren't paying good attention.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>2: <strong>stopping in place</strong>: right now <strong>when the creaking is observed, it returns to its idle stance.</strong> I can see how this makes sense because its trying to stand strait up like a tree would, BUT, the fact that it can be spotted doing this<strong>(along with sliding a bit)</strong> is the main reason the creaking is not as scary as it could be. an easy and Super effective fix, would be to<strong> make the creaking pause mid-walk animation</strong>. even if it still slides a bit, the fact that it just completely stops all movement would be MUCH more unsettling.</p>\n<p>these changes alone would make the creaking perfect as is, but a couple extra things you could change to give it just a bit more substance</p>\n<p>- A better spawning animation (a similar one to the warden would be nice)</p>\n<p>- more damage and speed (everyone agrees that this is needed)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

It could start by stalking you but some event makes it hunt and try to attack you.</li>\n<li>It definitely should be faster</li>\n<li>&nbsp;It would be cool if there was some thick fog in this biome to make it even harder to see the trees and really sell the effect.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;Adding fireflies that are the same color as the Creakings is <strong>GENIUS,&nbsp;</strong>it would make it even harder to see the Creaking!!!!!!</li>\n<li>One of the most important things that needs to be added is a reason to go there that could actually tie into the game somehow. A big problem with many of the new mob releases is that they don't effect how you beat the game, and even if they do affect the game, it's only in one part of it. I'm fine with the mobs that are there for a side quest, but it needs to tie in better. Otherwise all the newmobs and features being added over the years will really clog up the game.</li>\n<li>why cant i delete this bullet point lol Thanks for reading!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>\n</ol>",

It's also too easy to escape, the Warden is scary because escaping it is hard and requires a little luck, the slightest mistake could result certain death. So to make it harder to escape, the Creaking needs to be at least as fast as the player, preferably faster. It also needs to have some built in mechanism for avoiding traps, this is the most trappable mob in the game, I think it should be impossible to break the block directly below it, it needs to be able to scale two block tall walls, and if unable to pathfind to the player (i.e. the player sounded the Creaking in dirt) than it should disappear and respawn.</p>\n<p>Obviously the Creaking can't be as powerful as the Warden, because it often fights in groups of two or even three, but it needs to at least be threatening. Perhaps it should, as some other people have suggested, ignore armor so that its not to hard for beginners but not too easy for experienced players.</p>",

My suggestion is, in addition to the base damage, in its&nbsp;<em><strong>first attack it will cause half of the player's current life</strong></em>, ignoring armor like warden, but without being able to kill, as this depends on the current life, it will not always kill, but it will always give a scare.<br><br><strong>2- Climb and Cross Blocks</strong>: To correct the idea of ​​blocking the monster with blocks or digging underneath it, since it is similar to trees, it could&nbsp;<strong>have the gift of roots</strong>. Just&nbsp;<strong>like Spiders and Silver Fish, it could climb/cross,</strong>&nbsp;mainly blocks of land and trees. As a plus, perhaps leaving him hidden inside the blocks during the day would be interesting.<br><br><strong>3- Stalker Strategy:&nbsp;</strong>Possibly the most difficult mechanic, but more interesting. After he had carried out an attack on the player, he would hide for a random time, to finally carry out another powerful attack, and it was not easy for the character to keep looking back and tracking his safe position. To do this, after his first attack, the next time the player loses sight he would gain a<strong>&nbsp;random invisibility time (from 6 to 20 seconds for example) and would remain stil</strong>l, then return to his normal mode to carry out another attack. It changes the dynamics a little,<strong>&nbsp;leaving the player lost and paranoid.</strong></span></p>",

I get the feeling mojang wants the creaking to be more of an obstacle than a danger and this would increase the 'obstacle' which in turn adds the difficulty people want. Especially when there's other mobs around. It also means the difficulty setting has an impact on how you experience the creaking. Getting stunned when there's nothing around is annoying, getting stunned right as a creeper is walking up to you is a lot more stressful. Additionally I think a shadow-walker type of mechanic could work well, now you can keep track of where the creaking is and kind of lure it. That gets a lot harder when it can just disapear when you're not looking. Besides, having it jump from tree to tree feels a lot more natural for some reason. (also makes it harder to just run away from it)</p>",

I propose a rework of how you obtain the invisibility potion as it will involve the pale mushroom.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The current recipe of the invisibility potion doesn't make sense, the fermented spider eye creates negative potions with invisibility being an exception. In my opinion, night visions (Which makes you see better) negative and opposite potions should be something that makes you see worse. So invisibility will be made with the new pale mushroom. This mushroom will disappear during the day and reappear at night. This will incentivize entering the pale garden at night and facing the creaking. You may as well make it three blocks tall, with an unique decor plant.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in summary. The current recipe of invisibility will be reserved for another potion that makes sense and the invisibility potion will be brewed with the pale mushroom, a nocturnal plant.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I will also continue to add ideas below in the comments circling around this feature.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also please update your post to only focus on pale mushroom instead of several ideas like orange wood.</span></p>",

        "body": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also have other effects in the game that would definitely make a difference in PVP. For example, the glowing effect granted with spectral arrows (Java edition). But once again this effect doesn't have potions to make it easily accessible. This glowing effect potion, may as well call it spectral potion is brewed by using a fermented spider eye on an invisibility potion. Invisibility potion, where you can't be seen; turned into a potion where you are seen too much (By having a glowing outline around you). Again, imagine the effects this would have on PVP, your opponent is trying to run away or hide underground. Instead of ten seconds, which is what you get with a spectral arrow, you could get eight minutes. This seems unbalanced but remember it would still be able to be counteracted with milk, the trade off is that the person you are fighting would lose their own potion effects. The addition of this potion would give further reason to go to the pale garden and gather the invisibility mushroom at night and face the horrors of the creaking.</span></p>",
