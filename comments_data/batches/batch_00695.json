I understand that i am in a tiny minority of builders but i belive that there is a solution that makes everyone happy. <em><strong>My solution is that all bedrock blocks that are adjacent to an air liquid or translucent block should be kept as bedrock and all bedrock blocks that are not become deepslate.</strong></em> this way player builds aren't changed and they can still explore the new depths of the underground. Another similar scenario is that a player may have incorperated the void into a build, to stop this from being changed any holes in bedrock should have an area around them that goes down into the void.</p>",

The reason for this is because deepslate generates from Y = 0 slowly to Y = -8, and it would look ugly from a side view to see solid deepslate, and right under it, stone transitioning into it. Another thing: Since some people use the bedrock at Y = 5 to Y = 0 for wither cages, I would also reccomend making the conversion of the bedrock optional, giving us two options, the latter being the one in this Bedrock beta, and the former being what was in previous Bedrock betas (64 layers of bedrock under old chunks).&nbsp;</p>",

It is incredibly minor, I understand that. However, that is precisely why I think you should just nip that one in the bud real quick. As well as update Bedrock’s maps! Let us get waypoints and names on our maps like Java can. Also, I haven’t been able to see these new caves below bedrock on my Minecraft survival world that enables all experimental features.

The biomes are completely different and there is no resemblance at all. I came here because I was wondering if the seed are generating correctly, or maybe the changes are so great that seeds will just be different.

I'm glad that there's finally something powerful to be scared of, and I hope that the Warden will not go extinct in worlds. It's very unfortunate that challenging fun enemies like Elder Guardians and Piglin Brutes can go extinct, which makes combat a limited activity to do in Minecraft. I hope that Archaeology will be a repeatable activity in Minecraft as well, and can be done in other dimensions! It's not always possible to explore new chunks in mobiles/consoles due to file size limitations, renewability of items/mobs/activities is important.</p>\n\n<p>Java players should have this world upgrade option as well.

Corrupted worlds with constant crashes, that's a terrible experience.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also afraid of the world file size getting too big, Minecraft Bedrock starts to get unplayable once the file size is in the gigabytes. It gets laggy, and consoles have limited file sizes to begin with. I hope there's a way for Minecraft to automatically trim unnecessary files in worlds, hopefully without causing corruption or losing progress in the game. I heard that map items can bloat the file size, even if you discard the map. I hope even if the file size does get big, it's still playable on other platforms like mobile.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly is lag. Been playing the betas &amp; experimental features on a decent android phone. Slight framerate drop, but it's playable. Although, it'll probably get worse as you play the game more, exploring new chunks &amp; building. Things like storage chest rooms, redstone contraptions like hoppers &amp; flowing water, persistent mobs in caves like zombies holding items and trader llamas building up and colliding... glow signs, paintings, armor stands &amp; item frames, random ticks like plant growth &amp; snow/grass decay... perhaps they can be made less laggy?</p>",

This boss is often praised for being challenging and more interesting than the Java counterpart, and is unfortunately the only challenge left for enchanted netherite players. However, the devs need to make floating item entities less CPU-demanding. Perhaps an option to render floating items as simple 2D sprites instead of spinning 3D models? Perhaps item entities shouldn't check for so many things every tick?</p>\n\n<p>In the future, perhaps bosses shouldn't be so destructive to the environment, while still being a huge challenge to overcome, as floating item entities can cause extreme lag.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you so much for all the hard work, by the way. After 1.18, Minecraft can finally compete with mods, maybe even exceed them someday. Feel free to take inspiration from popular mods as they're often a culmination of what players want in the game. Bedrock doesn't have mods, so it'd be great if vanilla Minecraft can surpass mods someday!</p>",

Some I've found have been more hole than mountain, and some haven't been there at all, just a flat bit of stone or snow on the ground where the mountain should be.

I think the range is in a good spot but I feel like the range needs to be adjusted or have the option to be adjusted in the context of the deep dark since torches should be heard when placed but the fear of not knowing beyond the light is terrifying. maybe the option of range increase up to fifteen when placed on certain blocks like skulk blocks/growths and or blocks present in the deep dark</p>\n<p>2. Personally, i the current system is good but don't take my word on it</p>\n<p>3.I think it being waterlogged is awesome but it does affect Redstone. I think options are nice and I think carpets are a good way to silence the vibrations and I would like sculk vibrations to travel faster and be more audible when players are underwater.</p>\n<p>4.The sculk frequencies are amazing but a way to recognize certain sounds are needed. I think a way to do this is to have the option to power/lock the sensor. When an action is performed, it'll lock the sculk and it will only recognize that action. This isn't intended to replace frequencies since programmed sculks will only produce a signal strength of one to reduce it's potency. and to revert it just remove and place it. This way, we can fit more vibrations without affecting what's good about them right now.</p>",

Being able to prevent footstep detection would allow players to feel much safer when just simply walking through someone's base and would solve the problem of footsteps occluding other actions from being detected. However avoiding vibrations would still be a challenge, as all other types of vibrations would not be preventable.</p>\n<p>Another idea I had would for footstep vibrations (or all vibrations) was to have them \"dampen\" as they travel through different blocks. Dampening is figured out before a vibration is made, to determine if the sculk sensor will be able to sense the vibration or not (too much dampening = sculk doesn't sense vibration). The amount of dampening of a block is determined by the tool used to mine it. Pickaxe blocks dampen the least, then axe blocks, hoe blocks, and finally shovel blocks dampen the most. This is based on how sound is transmitted in real life: the harder and more compact the material, the better sound is transmitted. Pickaxe blocks are the hardest, and shovel blocks which are the softest and least compact. This would add some interesting mechanics for redstoners and cause players wary of traps to only have to sneak when near blocks that transmit vibrations well.</p>\n<p>Sorry for being so brief I ran out of characters</p>",

        "body": "<p>1- While the current frequency ranges feel comprehensive, they also feel slightly bloated. For example, the detection of a lightning strike does not need to be detected in this way, as you just implemented a different way of detecting them (lightning rods). I think the frequencies could be trimmed a bit from actions that can easily be detected another way. There is also a problem where the higher frequencies have way too many things on the same frequency, where it is much too easy to produce a false positive.</p>\n<p>2- Stated above.</p>\n<p>3- As for skulk sensors being waterlogged, I think that this feature is essential, as it provides a huge benefit for those who use them in their bases, ie. no annoyingly constant sounds, while also not too drastically effecting those who are the target of a trap. This is because, it is still possible to see the generated particles travelling to the skulk sensor.</p>\n<p>4- This is admittedly the part of the skulk sensor that I was the most concerned about after we got it. This part of the sensors design allows the sensor to easily miss a vibration, such as a player eating, if, for example, the player just walked into the area. The best way that I have thought of to fix this issue, is for when a comparator is facing into the sensor, whatever signal strength is coming out of the comparator, and thus powering the sensor, is the exclusive frequency in which the sensor will listen for.</p>",

Wool carpets come in 15 different colors, exclusing white. Each frequency could be given a carpet color (blues being high frquency, reds being low frequency). Vibrations would be occluded if they pass through a carpet that doesn't match their frequency.</p>\n\n<p>Then, the question becomes \"How can this be optimized?\" because this kind of filtering requires a lot of checks for a single game tick. Another solution could also then be to be able to \"refresh\" Sculk Sensors quickly, with bonemeal for example, so that if it got activated for the wrong frequency it could be refreshed to listen again quickly? That would require extra redstone to builds and might not be a perfect implementation though.</p>",

I'm not sure how that would really affect my use of the sensor, but it could be really op in the hands of a master redstone engineer. Being able to silence a sensor so players don't know they're being trapped is a very dangerous power if you know how to use it. I don't play enough PVP to bother prototyping such things, but I'm sure there will be plenty of PVP servers that will see SOMEONE utilizing the full capabilities of the sculk</p>\n<p>4. I actually might have a solution to this. If the sensor is outputting a low signal, like from walking, and a significantly higher noise occurs while the sensor is on cooldown like an explosion, it resets the cooldown with the new redstone level. It would have to be significantly louder for the sensor to go off again though- like at least 2 levels up.</p>",

Normally this would be negligible, or perhaps it would widen the uses of skulk sensors, but in some cases it causes it to become less effective, i.e. in traps.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one could silence the sensor by enchanting it via an anvil with Silk Touch, or concealing the particle waves by throwing a splash or lingering potion of invisibility on the sensor. I know that potions don't last long, so I came up with the idea (excuse) that skulk sensors retain the effects of a splash potion long after any other mob does (which really doesn't mean much if you were a sensor unless it meant you were more stealthy), say 1000 times longer, if it does not cause harm to the sensor. However, if you used a lingering potion on the sensor the effects would be permanent.</p>",

For example, when the Sculk Sensor detects Walking (frequency: 1) it ignores all walking vibrations for 40 ticks, but then Swimming (frequency: 3) can activate it again and restart 40 ticks cooldown. This allows us to filter out more frequent or low priority vibrations, but still remain sensitive to higher priority ones.</p>\n<p>So for example, if I open the iron door to my base (frequency: 11) nothing happens. But if someone tries to break in by breaking blocks (frequency: 13) this activates the intruder alarm.

This is just something to think about, skulk sensors are part machine (redstone components) and part living things (the skulk), we could express this idea through a recipe.<br>- Here comes the hardest part... how about them vibration types ? Well, one idea would be to give the skulk sensors a \"memory\" and a way to program them... like, how about powering the skulk sensors with a redstone signal, making a vibration, unpowering the skulk sensors and now the skulk sensor is programmed to only listen to that kind of vibration. This is an option. Another option would be to have a mechanic similar to note blocks. Depending on what kind of block we put under the sensor, it will \"resonate\" with different vibrations. I like this idea more and I want to expand on it a little bit. What if skulk sensors could \"hear\" noteblocks from up to 48 blocks away ? Specifically the note blocks with the same block under them. What if pitch would also be detectable with a comparator next to a skulk sensor ? This could be a wonderful feature.</p>",

A solution could be to make it so ancient cities or the deep dark biome could’t spawn under water and if it does that the water in the area at spawn would be overwritten with air blocks instead.</p>\n<p>Another thing is that frequencies and range should be allowed to be changed by a player on a crafting table for when they use it for red stone.

With the terrain being raised everywhere else, I feel like within each mountain range, there should be at least one of the peaks that reach y256+, even if the rest are a lot lower. On bedrock, mountain ranges typically have good jumps: y150 to y100 to y200 to y150 to y256 at its highest, then back down. It makes them stand out a lot more.</p>",

And i think it would be cool to still keep those flat areas (you increased them in this 2nd experimental snapshots) but it seems you may have overcompensated as theres still mountains but now theres tons of flat area, maybe find a good balance. Or maybe thats intended im not too sure. Finally i love the java AND bedrock mountains in there current state i think it would be cool to integrate bedrock mountains to have a RARE chance of spawning in java, for a good balance and bedrock has majestic mountains so they should be more rare whereas the common ones could be the current java mountains (as of the 2nd experimental snapshot) that may be a bit confusing but hopefully its good feedback!&nbsp;</p>",

Even though its still an experimental screenshot, I really like how everything is generated much more realistically. Caves are huge now and its not too difficult to find a very large hole here and there. There are some downsides though. For low end PC's, the generation is very slow and drops FPS (yes I do play on an Intel i3 laptop). I don't know if its just me or other laptop/low end pc users are having this problem but it I certainly do not like my FPS dropping to 10. Other than that, I think its a great step in the right direction making Minecraft generation much more realistic and unpredictable making your adventures even more enjoyable! My favorite part is probably how cave structures are much easier to find due to the generation making caves much bigger and wider! Good luck with the experimental snapshots, you're doing a great job.</p>",

Overall though, the changes to terrain generation from the current 1.17 release to the 1.18 snapshots is a huge improvement and I definitely like where the development is heading as far as terrain generation goes. There are some major issues, however:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extreme hills bordering with basically any biome does not work, especially with the warmer ones like deserts. This happens too often.</li>\n<li>The new peaks biomes are much too rare; the snowy tundra, birch woods, jungles and meadow biomes on the other hand, I feel, are too prominent.</li>\n<li>The change in cloud height greatly reduces the impact the taller terrain has, too. I loved how it felt to basically nearly reach cloud level on a mere plains biome, for example.</li>\n<li>Beaches are too wide and there is little variety in them. No beach is fully flat, for example - maybe add beach variant biomes (narrow, wide, mounds, flat etc.)</li>\n</ul>",

I have to say it's giving me strong nostalgic vibes for the b1.7.2and earlier terrain generation. I love it &lt;3 Obviously, the mountains are even taller than they were back then, but you get what I mean xD<br><br>My first world generated beautifully! This is the seed: 6817814977329480156<br>I spawned at -210 89 -293. The only slightly jarring thing was the random Azalea tree popping up nearby. In my opinion it makes the most sense for lush caves to be restricted to lower elevation and not generate trees in cold/hot biomes. In a plains, jungle, or forest biome, it seems completely reasonable for azaleas to grow on the surface and for lush caves to open up to the sky. I recommend heading east to the village and the following the valley north for a nice tour.</p>\n<p>The second world was just as pretty, but different biomes. The seed is: 2979522175651952302<br>I forget where I spawned, but I noticed some odd generation. I don't know the rules for snowy slopes, but the one at -555, 123, 205 seems out of place. I really think this mountain cap would have been better done was the sort of bluish-green grass and sparse trees that we had in mountains before with snow just at the top. The transition from oak forest and mesa plateau to a flat snow blanket devoid of vegetation seems really sharp! Just something about it seems too fast. I'm a fan of the blended biomes over random ones ^-^</p>",

To sum it up it feels like were putting so much new generation in, that the old generation is also being shoved out, and its important to have both of them be balanced and work together to make the world feel diverse and less hilly.</p>",

It would also make it much more rewarding and interesting to find them, than jump in the next big hole. <br>[In 1.17 and below there are the occasional giant holes (radius 10-25 or so) one can find, especially easy to find in the deserts - if they (the new carver) had the rarity of these, then it would be really interesting to explore.]</li>\n<li>the underground biomes are humongous. So my suggestion would be to decrease them in size, so they are dotted here and there. Also, another thing to be proud and exiting to find.</li>\n<li>the mountains I have seen were nice, although it would be nice to have maybe high singular peaks dotting out, being higher than the rest of the landscape - we have that to some extent, just maybe stretch them a bit more.</li>\n<li>beaches are back to beta values it seems, which is nice, but 3/4 of the current value could suffice.</li>\n<li>the biome layout is still a bit weird compared to 1.17 and below values.</li>\n<li>small bug: grass underwater in swamps.<br><br>Thanks!</li>\n</ul>",

However, it should be noted that my laptop has a quadcore processor, RTX 1060 graphics card and runs programs on a solid state drive so the lack of a performance drop doesn't say much.</li>\n<li>Local water levels aren't stable, it seems like caves are carving out the water source blocks making weird walls of water, I wonder if this is connected to the shoreline issues mentioned in the snapshot notes. I also stumbled upon magma blocks generated next to water but otherwise just on the dry floor of the cave. I suspect that the cave's floor dug through all the water leaving exposed magma blocks.</li>\n</ul>",

In summary, I would like to see the amount of ore in the world increased to previous levels but I am not sure what would be the best way to do that. Adding veins of the other most useful ore types (redstone, gold, and diamond) is another possible solution.</p>\n<p>The caves are certainly useful to players who only want to obtain ores in small quantities because players can find exposed ore, but I personally lament the reduction in ore quantity because I am one of those survival players who wants to collect lots of ores for projects without relying on farms like iron golem, zombified piglin, wither skeleton, and witch farms.</p>",

Also on the topic of mountain height, lofty peaks should naturally spawn higher mountain tops than snowcapped peaks. The name \"lofty peaks\" should translate into the generation, making truly the largest mountain tops in the game.</p>\n<p>I really like the cave changes, it definitely fixes the first problem I noticed which was that there's nothing stopping a survival player from immediately dropping to diamond level with a water stream. At the same time, caves aren't hard to find, and they still consistently lead to diamond level, just by having to look a little more.</p>\n<p>the micro biome changes are good, and the tree in the meadow is a nice addition. swamps seem to generate in places that make more sense, but woodland mansions seem to still generate half out of their biomes (but that could just be their size obviously)</p>",

We hope this change will make conquering a spawner a more exciting challenge!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But there's 2 problems with this. In it's current state, it seems like as long as the spawner block is light level 11 or higher nothing will spawn, in which case basically nothing changed, which is its own problem. But, if the intention was to make it so the spawner can check for nearby blocks that are below light level 11, then it's still not great. The only real change here is that we have to place 4-5 torches instead of 1, which really isn't any more of a challenge, since for experienced players, that should take&nbsp;<em>maybe</em> 2 seconds longer than just placing the one torch.</p>\n<p>To make vanilla dungeons a challenge, we could change the floor to be bottom half slabs so torches couldnt be placed on it. Also if the dungeon rooms were just a little bigger, it would really help a lot.</p>",

There's also less caves overall.</p>\n\n<p>I do agree that getting to deepslate level shouldn't be too easy. But I feel like this new snapshot's a downgrade compared to the last one. I hope that there will be more huge dripstone/lush caves in the future, they're beautiful. Some of the dripstone caves are flooded (great for variety!), and they could even have magma blocks, which is amazing to have.</p>\n\n<p>I noticed that people are having trouble finding lush caves, and especially dripstone caves. I hope they can be more common. Also, it seems that badlands and jungles are more common in these experimental snapshots, and I liked that. Dark oak mineshafts should be more common for variety!</p>\n\n<p>Amethyst geodes seem very rare lately, but I could be unlucky? It can be made just a little bit more common.</p>\n\n<p>Grass blocks decaying in water is something that might cause lag, and I've seen some.

I am an Italian concept artist and a huge fan of minecraft. I would like to give you my feedback even though my field of expertise is limited to the visual department and not to the design one. Personally, I really liked the eccentric generation of the first experimental snapshot but I realize that for the purposes of the gameplay it had several problems both for the excessive unevenness of the terrain that could create building problems and for the excessive number of deep caves that broke the game progression by giving access to advanced resources too directly. Speaking instead of the second snapshot it seems to me that there is an inverse problem, personally I believe that flat spaces are excessively present and I missed the particular mood that the previous generation offered, where every corner that was explored was unique and particular. I think a middle ground between the two could give an interesting result in this way the player would keep the feeling that by exploring he could find all kinds of weirdness and peculiarities while not being saturated with them. I realize that this is a trivial feedback and that you will have thousands of others to read, in case you read mine I hope that even in a small part it can help you find an optimal solution for all players! I am sure that in any case the result will be spectacular! Greetings from Italy!</span></pre>",

I do not like the micro biomes though and I think they should not be put into the game. The giant lava pools near bedrock are a cool feature to the new caves and I like how they interfere less with the surface. I am a fan of the lush caves cause they will be a good source of clay instead of having to have aqua-affinity to mine clay from rivers and swamps. I do not like how monster spawners can work in high light levels this makes making monster xp farms a lot more annoying. I am also concerned about how monsters spawning in complete darkness will affect mob farms that work because of a certain light level.</p>",

And if this Idea gets added in Minecraft Than we can name the sheep as jeb_ And It will be freaking awesome to see a colorful glowing sheep or even an RGB sheep. I Think that would be a nice tribute to the decade year old Easter Egg. And I'am Pretty Sure That jeb would be also happy about that.

I really like the new biome and cave shapes; the breathtaking, massive mountains and caves; and how each formation is unique. Large lush caves and groups of large mountains in particular are amazing, and its so cool to see biomes form to the terrain. I also found a nice meadow cutting a path through a dark oak forest.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Meadows &amp; Passive Spawns: </strong>The meadows in game break up the other mountain biomes well, and I like how they have unique spawning of sheep, rabbits, and donkeys. It would be great to have more biomes spawn specific animals more often than others or not at all, to encourage exploration and strategic passive farms. Also, it would be nice if animals spawned more often in general, especially on servers, where passives become incredibly hard to find after a while.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Darkness:&nbsp;</strong>The lush caves have cool illumination, but a lot of the other caves are too dark to appreciate the formations without night vision. Perhaps more lichen could be added (but nerfed so that it doesn't stop all monster spawning), or the brightness slider could be expanded to 200%.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Strange Biome Combinations:&nbsp;</strong>I did notice strange-looking biome mixes. Ice spikes generating right next to plains without a river or other biome between looks a bit out of place. The ice spikes were on a mountain, but perhaps start too low for it to seem plausible.<br><br>Thank you Mojang for releasing these snapshots for us, and making these awesome updates :)</li>\n</ul>",

First off, I'd like to say that world generation wise, it looked amazing. I'm loving the new heights and depths that mountains, hills, and caves can reach.</p>\n<p>2. Although there were definitely less small biomes, I did find a few . At -847, 74, -1507 there was a wooded badlands surrounded by a bamboo jungle, and at -1528, 95, -1288 there was an ice spikes biome in the middle of a bunch of plains. I have no doubt that you guys are fixing this, and overall there were definitely fewer microbiomes, so keep up the good work!</p>\n<p>3. Compared to the Plains biomes, there were very few forest biomes. Often times, you might be able to walk through a forest in less than 30 seconds while a plains could stretch on for ever. Maybe make forests a little more common/larger?</p>\n<p>4. There was a wooded badlands stretching up across a mountain directly next to a lofty peak at around 789, 151, -1874. The snow next to the terracotta didn't look too great.</p>\n<p>5. Minor thing, I was teleported inside a few mountain after using /locatebiome to find them. It was easy for me to get out of them, but it was a little annoying.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you so much for working on this update, I really enjoy playing Minecraft and appreciate everything you've done to improve the game.&nbsp;</p>",

Personally I'd say the mix of higher mountainy areas and flatter land is pretty spot-on. You have to walk a bit to find some things, but that's part of what makes Minecraft fun in my mind. I also really like the way tall birch biomes occur more often. Not a fan of the smaller trees.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>After spawning in, I promptly died by falling into powder snow, which happened to be covering a pit of lava. I feel that lava should not generate if powder snow is going to be the only block covering it, for one because that's a terrible way to lose all of your items, and two, it seems illogical, like the snow should have melted.</p>\n<p>Other bug mentions that may or may not be useful:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Saw some pandas that had spawned about 60-70 blocks away from the nearest bamboo jungle biome</li>\n<li>Saw some vines floating in midair in a different jungle biome</li>\n<li>I don't recall there being grass in mushroom field biomes</li>\n<li>Found an igloo about 40 blocks from its tundra biome, but the \"structures in the wrong biome\" thing is pretty well documented from the last snapshot.

Though, I think it would be good if you still had to mine above y=0 if you needed coal.</p>\n<p>P.S Currently I think Redstone is a smidge too common. also making coal being able to rarely generate at y=0 would be a good thing, so it is possible to get deepslate coal ore as a \"collectors item\" to perhaps show off in your world.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Ever since&nbsp; (I think) 1.7, world generation has been a bit too formulaic, but I think microbiomes and separating height maps from biomes has led to a bit of the chaos that existed before then to return, which I think is positive. I like how not every cave leads to deepslate now, but some still do. Keep in mind that a lot of people testing do so in creative, which offers a different experience than survival (ores are easier to find in creative) so I think more ores is positive. overall very nicely done.

Snapshot 2 seems to have decreased the frequency of truly cool, game changing generation, while increasing the apparent impact of wonky generation. In snapshot 1, everything \"worked\" because the generation was so striking, and varied - weird generation seemed interesting. Snapshot 2 feels loads more milquetoast (much more like pre-experimental generation) and the small glitches stick out more like a sore thumb.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I wish I could offer more detailed feedback but this is all I really have, other than badlands and jungles seeming to generate all the time which others are picking up on.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Lush caves looking awesome.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Couple of other things:</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">- Savannas seem too common, but I've had this complaint in previous versions too. Seems like when I find one, I hardly find another biome.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">- I wish that this update could truly push the envelope on what's considered \"normal\" terrain gen and focus on introducing mobility items to make the game more playable, rather than trying to retrofit new terrain generation to a game with honestly fairly unsatisfying movement mechanics (I think that's one of the weak points of Minecraft).</p>",

It'd be nice if the caves didn't connect to the surface as much.</p>\n<p>Aquifers are cool, but they always generate as a pool of water bordered by a flat layer of solid blocks. More variation would be good, like intentional waterfalls, borders that go up and down as they run along the edge of the aquifer, thicker and thinner borders.</p>",

The peaks are really small compared to the whole mountain, so it won’t be a challenge for a computer. Remove this limit, in my opinion there’s no point to intentionally cut the mountains at 256, moreover, such a high peaks are super rare, they would almost certainly not cause that much lags.

I've noticed that the mountain biomes are also significantly rarer now, since when I typed in a locatebiome command in previous versions, I could find all kinds of mountains. But now in the 2nd snapshot, I can only find wooded mountains and meadows with locatebiome, which don't go very high. And this was after creating several worlds with random seeds. So I couldn't really check out the mountains very well, but the few mountains I could actually find weren't very imposing figures. Maybe my luck is just bad. The caves however are absolutely magnificent, I haven't found any problems with them.<br>Edit: The snowier biomes such as Lofty Peaks and Snowcapped Peaks look great, and I have been able to actually find them. However the other biomes such as taiga mountains, extreme hills and etc, basically the grassier mountains, are still super rare or look like their old plateauish versions. I think these need a little tweaking, maybe to make them a bit more common as well as make them look better.</p>",

I like the look of the new update, but I agree with many others that there need to be more tall mountains.&nbsp; If you're going to keep iron more concentrated at higher elevations, you need to have those higher elevations available.&nbsp;Iron ore seems extremely rare. In 1.16 and 1.17, I could find plenty of iron while mining down to the lower levels to find diamonds. Now that doesn't happen, and mining tuff and deepslate with stone picks is not fun. So instead I have to spend time trying to find a tall mountain, and most of them seem to barely reach 150. And some of the taller ones I have found are very thin and spindly with little room to explore.</p>\n<p>I also had one world which seemed to have no large mammals due to some glitch. I saw lots of bees and a few squid; but the only rabbits I saw were in the desert, and I saw no cows, pigs, sheep, foxes or wolves.</p>\n<p>As I said, I like the way things are looking! With some tweaks to iron distribution and mountain formation you'll definitely have a winner.</p>\n<p>Peace,</p>\n<p>Mike</p>",

However, I am a big fan of the new cave distribution that allows for cave dwelling alongside strip mining. Any change I haven’t mentioned I think is a positive. Thanks for reading!</p>\n<p>p.s.: mobs also spawn in too light of areas in my opinion, requires a ridiculous amount of torches</p>",

The caves went from apparently going down to diamond level too often and having too big entrances to being almost invisible.</p>\n<p>I get the occasional swiss cheese cave and very rare massive ones but the small ones are so rare you can barely tell they're part of the game, and the big ones may be rarer still but they can't be missed.

It's supposed to be more common now than it was in the last snapshot. While I didn't play the last snapshot, I don't think I've found less iron ore in my first hour of playing a world than any other. Ores may be less rare in this snapshot but they're still too rare compared to previous releases.</p>\n<p>In short, too sparse cheese caves, too few ores, too many aquifers (especially lava, seems almost as common as water, should be twice as rare compared to water, or rarer.

Minecraft needs something scary and tough lurking in the deeper oceans. It'll also make Axolotl armies more useful! A hostile arthropod mob is preferable to make Bane of Arthropods enchant useful.</p>\n\n<p>I disagree on keeping the old caves and making megacaves/mountains rarer, and reverting it back to 1.17 generation, just to have the \"Minecraft feel\". A lot of people in the community are already hyped with the new generation from experimental snapshot 1, and it'll greatly disappoint them if 1.18 looks just like 1.17. People are bored of old Minecraft generation. Minecraft should continue to evolve to a better game that remains relevant for decades. I'm against the idea of sticking to a strict \"Minecraft feel\". Instead, they should continue making daring updates that keep the community alive!</p>\n\n<p>I think lush cave rarity is fine as it is. It's a beautiful, useful biome that should be common! However, they really need to make dripstone caves more common and longer/larger. There's too many normal caves, surely there's room to put more dripstone biomes here and there?</p>",

The terrain is wide, but life is scarce!</strong></em><br><em>- The terrain is very wide and satisfactory. However, there seems to be a lack of biological population and diversity. For example.. Fish, wild beasts, etc.. It's hard to find animals that seem to live in the mountains.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>2. Mountain terrain is generated too often!</strong></em><br><em>- We usually live at an average of 500 meters, but Minecraft seems to have too many overwhelmingly large mountains. A lot of majestic mountains like the Himalayas are even nicer, but there are too many to interfere with gameplay and make it hard to find flat terrain.</em></p>\n<p><em><strong>3. The mountainous terrain is so empty!</strong></em><br><em>- In our real world, civilizations have developed even in high places like alpine cities. Of course, Minecraft isn't the real world, but I think it's a bit plain.

Yet, they still play a part in how the terrain in each biome generates. (Eroded badlands still generates thin plateaus, etc.)</li>\n<li>I think you've struck a nice balance on the rate of giant caves.</li>\n<li>I love that the size of biomes is more variable again. Small biomes can lead to more interesting terrain spawning if a small, hilly biome is placed in the middle of a larger biome that would normally have flatter terrain.</li>\n<li>I think the balance between sharp cliffs and blending elevation changes is spot on. I love that biomes don't need a specific \"hills\" variant to generate interesting terrain now.</li>\n<li>This is something else that I'm not sure is intentional, but ocean biomes seem to generally line up better with the temperature of the land they're placed next to. (Warm ocean is placed next to desert, etc.)</li>\n<li>I like the larger beaches. This change helps to create some nice coastlines, but I do think that they need to be generally flatter.</li>\n<li>Rivers could still use some work and should wider in most cases.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall I think this terrain just needs a bit of tweaking and fine-tuning, but is an extremely solid foundation for this update and really brings the organic feel back to Minecraft terrain.

I really like the steep hills and narrow valleys that can now generate; they give the world a lot more variety. Obviously, there's still some tweaking to do there - microbiomes and very odd generations still exist - but in general, I like it. Especially the broader, more defined rivers.</p>\n<p>However, I really feel like the mega caves are just&nbsp;<em>way&nbsp;</em>too common. Like, WAY too common. I understand that not everyone wants to explore a long way to find the massive caverns, but in my exploration, about 3 of every 4 caves I set foot in led to an unbelievably massive system. It's not just unrealistic; it also reduces the awe of finding such caves, since after seeing the first five awe-inspiring caverns, the rest feel commonplace. Small caves are good for a lot of reasons, but most importantly for this update, they put the large ones in perspective. So please, reduce the number of awe-inspiring caverns. I love the cave generation - the dripstone is awesome, the lush caves are beautiful, and the aquafiers give a whole new sense of adventure to caving - but too much of the same kind of&nbsp;<em>awesome!!!&nbsp;</em>in one place&nbsp;becomes bland very quickly.</p>\n<p>One more note about water. Now that the world depth is much lower, I think it would be really neat if the oceans were deeper. It just doesn't make sense that you can dive to the bottom of the deepest sea in one breath. Just my opinion. It's not a huge problem though.</p>",

Not big gradients but at least maybe 10 or 20 blocks of transition between dramatic biome changes. Another extreme example being desert to jungle or lofty peaks to plains.

Add functionality to these so that they work just like stone (such as usability with new bricks, in crafting, etc). This would make areas (especially areas with exposed stone) even more unique! (I'd also suggest a warm, tan colored stone).</p>\n<p>-whatever you do, do not make biomes of a type too samey. Keep it wild.</p>\n<p>-oceans could be deeper in some places. I found several \"almost islands\" where the land was juuust under the water and that was cool, though it'd also be really cool to see sections of ocean that go DOWN.</p>\n<p>-I'd suggest some kind of arid/desert peaks, where the mountain could rise out of a desert/badlands/savanna.

Earlier, you would find enough iron for a full set of armour within a single good cave or 2-3 medium ones. Now, iron takes forever to find. If you skim the surface, you can only find 1-2 pieces at a time. That's fine so you don't get too OP too quickly, but none of the caves go really deep (at least when I was searching around) or they have water in them. The water gets a little annoying, because you have to mine a lot of wood to make doors so that you can breathe and don't drown. But since you can't go deep, you don't get a good amount of iron, which makes you prone to dying to a mob. Strip mining is fine for diamond but for iron, caving is better and I still think it should be that way, especially since you're trying to get it at the beginning of the game and that's supposed to be fun, while strip mining is really boring. I also faced the problem with iron being too rare with the datapack earlier, and I thought it would be fixed but it's still a problem.</p>",

It's a decorative block that doesn't serve any useful purpose. How about adding some tin so we can smelt bronze? It would make up for the scarcity of iron. Usable ores in general are scarce as teeth on a hen, which makes the prevalence of copper all the more infuriating. Every piece of copper I mine is going straight into the nearest magma pit.</li>\n<li>Reduced air exposure and reduced clump size of diamond means finding more than a few will require extremely tedious and methodical mining of chunks.</li>\n<li>Surface caves are very shallow.

So digging down or mountain tops were the only viable options for iron anyway.&nbsp; <br><br>Then I explored the top of the mountain.&nbsp; Mountain tops were at 160-175, and I looked at all accessible surfaces, plus did a fair bit of mining into the taller points.&nbsp; Only found 21 iron (vs. 8 stacks of cobblestone mined with stone pickaxes.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some iron might have been obscured by all the snow.&nbsp; I don't feel iron mining with this height mountain is viable in this beta.<br><br>Also, ended up with a ton of coal and cobblestone but no other building blocks. This will make for a pretty boring starter house.&nbsp; Would it make sense to adjust frequency of some of the other blocks based on distance below the surface rather than absolute Y level?&nbsp; (i.e. 10 blocks below mountain surface is andesite / granite / etc.)&nbsp; Maybe iron, etc. too.&nbsp; Tunneling into the mountain would then be useful.<br><br>Also, there's almost no water, despite nearby snow.&nbsp;&nbsp; Building a crop farm is going to require a long hike with a bucket.&nbsp; How about some mountain streams?&nbsp; (Preferably a line of water sources with fish!)</p>",

Where I spawned I was in the middle of a giant lava pool and every biome that was around never touched the ground. There were no flat surfaces to really explore and survive the nether basically. The caves were a 10/10 for me, I loved them they were great. Never really saw any high mountain areas in the overworld.

        "body": "<p>The mountains are absolutely breath-taking and the new terrain generation around them is just stunning. Kuddos to the developers for creating this masterpiece. Maybe we could do with slightly increased chances of generation though? Also, I do wonder, if players want to casually explore the mountains, maybe there should be a simpler method to make either jumping higher or gliding a little easier? Pogo sticks, grappling hooks or hang-gliders, perhaps? Ender pearls are an option but these cannot easily be obtained in large quantities in peaceful, rabbits' feet are rare and elytra is difficult to acquire. It would also make more sense if azalea trees had unique bark rather than just reusing oak. The reduction of mega caves is a little sad. Exploring those in previous snapshots was just something else and their increased rarity somehow makes it feel like something is missing after having experienced them prior to April. And as for when mega caves intercepted the surface... that's a feature that's just too good to remove or reduce. It really adds to terrain variation and makes Minecraft so much more interesting and the underground much more inviting for exploration. Finally, probably a bit of a long shot, but maybe one day we might see glowing crystal caves even if they are extremely rare? Geodes are lovely in their own right, but many people, including myself, have always hoped crystal caves would one day be added. Good luck to the devs, and thank you for all their hard work!</p>",

Another way of putting it is that only 0.00152587890625% percent of seeds remain.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>From finding interesting spawn points with the coolest terrain generation to share with your friends, to complex searches using the top 16 bits of the long type getting the fastest possible seeds; the community relies on the long type (support up to 2^64), the relationship between the 48 lower and 16 upper bits that makes a seed. Unfortunately, in the 1.18 Experimental Snapshots, this has been reduced to only using Java random, which only uses 48 bits from the seed. This loses the ability to change the spawn point or biomes while leaving the structures, terrain, loot, Nether, and End the same. The seed finding community heavily relies on the full use of 2^64 seeds and the additional relation between the lower 48 bits (the \"structure seed\") and the upper 16 bits that determine biomes. In the current latest experimental snapshots, every seed you load will have 65535 other exact copies, so over 99.99% of seeds are redundant.</p>\n<p>The community is unsure if this was an intentional change by Mojang because A) it hasn't been fixed yet or B) it wasn’t listed as a known issue. We are deeply concerned over this and hope this message brings some attention to the issue and clarification over if this is intentional.</p>",

I had a much easier time getting diamonds and enchanted iron than I did with the bundle. Had to kill 10 rabbits to get the 6 hide required, and that was because I was lucky enough to find a desert which had enough rabbits in it. If Bundles are intended to be a midgame item then this makes sense, but if the intention is to make bundles early game then it doesn't really pan out since I wasn't able to get them until later in the playthrough.</p>",

Most of current features are in my honest perfect, but there are some changes I would love to see in incoming snapshots:</p>\n\n<p>-Add snowy versions of Mega taiga and Giant spruce taiga. I Noticed these biomes generate now very commonly next to mountains, snowy taigas ans tundras, so snow-covered, giant trees would fit perfectly to the landscape\n<br />-Improve generation of tops of the big mountains. I often see a perfectly- flat, like cut with a knife, tops of these Giant, above 200 blocks Mountains. In my opinion more steeper, rocky and jagged peaks would look much better. Maybe even a new biome, generating only on tops of highest mountains?\n<br />-Giant mountains should be more common. I had a hard time finding a mountain reaching above clouds in creative, so in survival that would be almost impossible to find!\n<br />-Decrease amount of exposed diamond ores. These are wayyy too common, making diamond easy to find, contradicting their premise.\n</p>",

I think you should add silver ore so we can have copper silver and gold. You could add in lead ore it would be or around the same tier as iron. There could also be steel added by combining iron and diamonds i think it would be the same mining and combat tier as iron but more durable than diamonds. There could also be aluminum as a later game ore as it can only be smelted with a special smelter that's a hotter than a normal smelter like you should have to make it with a furnace iron and a fire charge. I think there needs to be more mining tiers. And i think there should be more ores to mine in the nether. Add in cobalt to the nether that can only be mined with a netherite pickaxe. Add titanium to the nether as well and make it so that only a cobalt pickaxe can mine it. Then the last tier in the nether should be a special Hellstone ore that can only be mined with a titanium pickaxe. Then there should be a fine diamond tier which would be the best but it can only be mined with a Hellstone pickaxe and it comes from normal diamond ore blocks as well as normal diamonds. And then the fine diamonds could only have a 20 percent of dropping from being mined with a Hellstone pickaxe. There should also be an ore in the end that can be mined with a Hellstone pickaxe or a fine diamond pickaxe </p>",

Their current \"ceiling\" seems to be no more than y80. This could be increased well over 100 blocks! Optionally, introduce a sub-biome that generates in the center of the island called \"Mushroom_peak\" that has a terrain ceiling of over 150!</p>\n<p>• Some are too small, some are too large. If the sizes are going to vary so much, why not make them slightly more common? It's no fun finding a mushroom biome that's entirely submerged due to it's tiny size!</p>\n<p>• Allow Ocean structures (Shipwrecks, Ocean Ruins) to spawn *on* the mushrooom islands. Possibly at an even more commonly than the rest of the ocean! It would thematically improve the biome, giving it that er of mystery it had when it was first introduced. You could populate the currently missing Mushroom_field_shore biome with them as to insinuate thematically that people have crashed on the mysterious island!</p>\n<p>• Populate large caves under Mushroom biomes with Mycelium pockets, and allow mushrooms and giant mushrooms to spawn within those caves in greater-than-default quantity. You could even increase the lichen spawn count substantially to help illuminate the mushrooms just like how Shroomlights do in the nether!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I know this was long, but I hope you see the passion behind my suggestions :)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

I'm having a hard time finding much flat terrain, especially in places like jungles, my favorite biome. Plus, again, the biomes are all way too small. Even with my pathetically low render distance, I can usually see other biomes in the distance. I explored a savanna-jungle thing, too. The biomes kept breaking up into each other. I'd suggest splitting biomes into large \"blobs\" that don't intersect each other very much, so you can still get unbroken views of whatever biome you're visiting, even with a high render distance. Plus, having more plateaus would be nice, all of the mountains seem impossible to build on!</p>",

They have always felt strangely small since the 1.7 \"Update that Changed the World.\"</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The reasons for making oceans small are GONE. They used to be empty and boring, wasted space. Now they are anything but.</li>\n<li>It used to be hard to mine under oceans. Now we have a whole underground world under every ocean.</li>\n<li>More oceans give us more space to enjoy the better beaches and possible really cool shores with the new terrain.</li>\n<li>We can move around the map faster on water, exploring the coast. This is more important nowadays with the wonderful variety of biomes and features there are to look for.</li>\n<li>It's not as easy as it should be to find enough space for an undersea city without any visible shores nearby - oceans are tiny!</li>\n<li>I love the idea of mapping an entire continent and putting that map on the wall. I can't do that if the whole world is one continent!</li>\n<li>The world feels slightly more \"real\" if it matches our expectations from our real lives, and we live on a planet that's mostly covered by water. A map that's less than 30% water is weird. I'd like my map to be 60%+ water, with large, distinct land masses surrounded by oceans of various widths.</li>\n<li>You're already making big changes to the overworld.

I went looking around the world for a bit by boat, I found a very spectacular, laggy Mountain which was great. I enjoyed the size of some of the biomes and liked how flat and suitable some of them where. Some places looked great and idealic. The biome blending was great as well. Now while I did go sightseeing the real reason I traveled 5000 blocks was to find a village. Which I did, I set up base there and terrarforming was/is a big task. Performance was great after I turned my render distance down. Sidenote; going to the nether made my game very unstable IDK if that's imporant.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>With my base set up; I decided to start making stuff. My villagers dissapeared for some reason; I think they froze in powered snow or something. But I set up a breeder so it didn't matter.&nbsp; While mining I found the new caves looked great but they made mining more tedious; glad there weren't many mobs to make it impossible; I also like the way the cave system keeps going if you follow the flooded caves. But I still haven't found diamonds for some reason. There was terrian generation in some caves near the surface, but I found it cool when I mined some gravel that it connected to a surface lake. One thing I didn't like were some of the standing water ponds in the caves. Looked like someone had just walled them off. Overalll I have found the new generation thouroughly enjoyable and enjoyed the new challenges. Hope this helps :)</p>",

But if you do consider this idea don't do it too much as you still want that awesome view just do it a bit! Finally i think there should be areas with higher terrain MORE COMMONLY, for more variation but still some flatter areas.

In my opinion this offers a nice break, and I think it is fitting that the cave biome made to feel alive isn't crawling with hoards of the undead. I have found both dripleaf plants and glowberry vines useful for traversing lush caves, and this is fantastic. The biggest gameplay issue I have is the regular vines generating in the lush caves. In narrow passages these vines have pretty much unlimited growth potential and can easily take over caves and ruin the aesthetic. I would recommend removing these vines from lush cave generation between jungles and swamps we have enough places to find these vines already and they're a bit redundant with glowberry vines already there.</p>\n<p>In terms of appearance I think there is too much clay generating on the cave walls and ceilings, it looks really out of place there. Lush caves also feel too dry, there's clay all over the floor with no water and I don't think this works aesthetically. This might also be why I can't seem to find any axolotls, which were a pretty big selling point for the biome as a whole.&nbsp;</p>",

The addition of stony peaks also works really well to accompany the notion that \"in real life\" not all high mountains are snowy all the time.</p>\n<p>2. Mobs now requiring absolute darkness to spawn is fantastic. It reduces the ugliness of torch spamming and makes lighting up the new larger cavern systems possible (I've placed over 4k torches in a cave system in a world I started with the 2nd experimental snapshot and I still see plenty of mobs in there as I explore). In no way has requiring block light 0 kept me from having mobs be a part of my minecraft experience.</p>\n<p>3. Making iron slightly more accessible does not, in my mind, eliminate early game. Previously in a new world, I would immediately start farming trees to dig a branch mine to get iron and other resources, taking great pains to avoid mobs until I was established with iron (at least) tools, shield, etc. Now, with the ability to (usually) find a piece of iron relatively quickly, I've taken to crafting a shield early on and then exploring the world more. This is much more fun than mob avoidance branch mining.</p>\n<p>4. As I'm sure you know, performance is sketchy at times.</p>\n<p>5. Keep up the good work. 1.18 is _well_ on its way to becoming my favorite Minecraft release since the Update Aquatic™ (and probably my favorite ever).</p>",

The caves underneath are 'old Minecraft but 200% cooler and more amazing', and the surface is now 'old Minecraft but 30% more amazing'.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">Now, if there is a really cool feature or mountain, it's ONE of them, surrounded by flat, or stuff that's barely more interesting than what we currently have. So, if you build on it, your entire view is bland flatness. Or, you have to build in the bland flatness to have one amazing thing to look at.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">And, what the heck happened to Bryce Canyon-style badlands? All I see are lumps that look like sand castles after your big brother poured water on them.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I think the feedback process has pushed the landscape into the lowest common denominator in a big way. I'm just going to make peace with that, and start learning how to mess with custom worlds in order to get something remotely approaching the awesomeness of Amplified.</p>",

Actually any mobs spawn.&nbsp; It is very strange.&nbsp; The world Gen is absolutely beautiful although there seems to be quiet a few suspended islands defying the laws of physics!&nbsp; All in all the second snapshot really has begun to redefine Minecraft.&nbsp; I really enjoy traveling for 3000 blocks and seeing rare biomes pop up over the horizon looking cooler than ever.&nbsp; Even common biomes seem to have a new mystique to them that really set the mood and tone, really driving the lore home.&nbsp; I have several notes with the seed number and coords I will be reporting in a couple days of a few things I noticed.&nbsp; Improper temp, spawners&nbsp; that seem wall spawn suffocating every entity it spawns, an invisible barrier at y=127 that I have checked and rechecked 30 times and it is always there.&nbsp; I have changed resource and texture packs trying to identify what is to no avail.&nbsp; I have no clue what is there but it kills me every time I elytra into it.&nbsp; I will be reporting complete data soon.

If there was an option for \"continent\" generation, as well as customizing the size of biomes via slider that would be nice, alongside a \"Legacy\" option for older worlds on the main menu when generating new worlds. I am a big fan of the older continent generation that was available in versions 1.6 and below, with much more ocean. Much easier to manage worlds as well since one could just make the world border on the oceans instead of on land. Hopefully this helps.</p>",

Also would love to see gold get massive veins like iron and copper, perhaps in the Mesa with Quartz? It’s an under appreciated/ under discussed new addition imo and think at the very least massive mesa gold mines would be an amazing use of that new feature.

I know the benefits of being able to wear both. 1) you'll look a lot cooler in full armor AND elytra. 2) it would feel much more rewarding and progressive to wear both. 3) it is less annoying to just wear them both than to have to switch between them. 4) You free up exactly 1 inventory slot.</p>",

The cave update is supposed to bring reason to mine underground, not just to build another farm to get it that easily. That ruins the whole point of the cave update. What we need is to continue to make caves more exciting, and also to start making strip mining exciting, and more reasonable, especially to make strip mining an actual good idea.<br>And If you are going to make it be farmable, at least make it so the drowneds also have to spawn holding it in its off-hand, so it can still spawn with tridents too.<br>Another way to make copper easier to get but still underground is by frequently getting it in mineshaft chests.</p>",

A lot of people think this is realistic, but it actually isn't. Hoppers in real life, for instance, are made out of steel, and pistons are made out of tungsten, which resembles iron more than copper. Redstone components don't always necessarily transmit or produce power; they might just use redstone power to cause an action, and sometimes these actions can be detected by other redstone components that do produce power. Redstone is not necessarilly electricity, either. Redstone is its own form of power transmition and production, and acts a lot like electricity. It might use copper for power, but it doesn't need to rely fully on it. Besides, changing the crafting recipe and ID's of an item can really mess a lot of things up.</p>",

For two, it allows for full Blocks of Copper to be rarer than Cut Copper, and maybe then you could allow them to power Beacons bases.</p>\n<p>Feature-wise, Copper doesn't have enough to compete with Iron nor Gold, and I can't see myself really seeking it out. Sure, the building blocks are great, but there's no Copper item that makes you continously want to stock up on it (like it's the case for Hoppers or Golden Apples). Copper could have more Rails and Minecart related uses, especially to make Minecarts a better transportation option (it's expensive and fun to build rail networks, but it's never actually worth it).</p>\n<p>Finally, some small additions; it'd be cool for Husks to drop Copper Ingots rather than Iron. It'd be also really practical if smelting time was faster, like 150t/75t rather than 200t/100t.</p>",

Copper tools and armor wouldn't add anything to the game. A dedicated nugget should only exist if we need crafting recipies for it, or add the previously stated tools and armor. There are also a few holes in what you're saying. There is not a rail type for each metal: there are four rail types, and one of them just happens to use gold. There is no reason why we should add these or how they would improve the game. And, if we were to do this, wouldn't we have to add Cut Iron and Cut Gold and slabs/stairs of them? How about we add Gold Bars and Copper Apples while we're at it? Each metal should have it's unique features, and we shouldn't just add a ton of random stuff for \"consistency\"</p>\n<p>Edit: <x-zendesk-user data-user-name=\"Tabarnaque8507\">398099918792</x-zendesk-user> Thanks for clarifying about what you meant about a lot of the stuff you suggested, but Copper Armor still feels like a mod thing that shouldn't be in the game. That might be just me though, but having an alloy like Bronze becoming an armor would fit in the game a lot more than copper. I do think the copper pressure plate has a place in the game, but I think the devs don't want to add any more copper blocks because then they'd have to make 4 weathered versions of it xD</p>",

If you modified any zombie spawners that occur in desert biomes to be husk spawners, it would encourage exploration further to search for that specific way to reliably farm for copper. Of course it might also be a unique challenge to develop a way to farm husks specifically without a spawner as well.</p>",

Due to character limit, this post will only summarize my idea and explain what I didn't cover in my other post.<br><br>I think if pipes were added, they would make the most sense as an item transportation block. I've seen a few people suggest fluid transportation, but to me that doesn't make sense since an infinite source of water can be created anywhere with 2 buckets of water and shulkers make carrying lava pretty efficient. Item transportation right now mainly includes water streams and hopper chains, and to me, it feels like hopper chains should be replaced by copper pipes.<br><br>To implement another item transportation block without replacing hoppers, pipes wouldn't be able to pick up dropped items, couldn't be locked, and would have only one inventory slot. With these (or even vaguely similar) conditions, I believe they could coexist and complement hoppers. Pipes would do the work of moving items omnidirectionally through spaces, and hoppers would pick up, filter, and control the flow of the items going in and out.&nbsp;<br><br>Copper pipes would be a great way to encourage gathering large amounts of copper besides for copper blocks and would act as a cheaper and more efficient version of hopper chains. Not only would they look good in industrial builds, but they would provide an efficient way to transport items.</p>",

I agree with Yagosski in that it would be helpful to have wrench item that could rotate blocks. I would also REALLY want to see a piston-ish version that rotates blocks around the piston-ish block when powered, and can be connected with slime or honey. (It would be great for unfolding contraptions and flying machines) This should be separate from a wrench in a dispenser, which would rotate blocks around themselves, as the wrench would.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">2. I believe that I saw somewhere a suggestion for having lava buckets or cauldrons gain a use for dewaxing copper, which makes sense.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. I am on the 9 ingot side for copper block crafting, in fact I have always felt that all \"block\" of something recipes should take 9, and while I know how difficult this can be for builds (I have made survival quartz bases) I agree with the spacial consistency on this one point.</span></li>\n</ul>",

Copper likely shouldn't have an armor set, as having armor for every metal would clog up the armors and tiers, though I do argue for more armors that lean towards specific attributes and such (I’d like to see a bone armor that stops skeletons from attacking you). This said, I wouldn't mind a bronze armor set if we get tin, as there probably could be things done with it, and it would be in the right direction for other things. It is historically consistent, it goes along with not having everything get an armor, and maybe combining metals into alloys which can. (Big fan of alloys).</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. As to the issue of gold vs. copper for drown drops, I like the gold for the treasure aspect and relation to sea monuments, but also copper's color scheme and submarine affiliation. Personally, I am currently leaning back towards gold, but I don't have particularly strong feelings either way on this.</span></li>\n</ul>",

I would prefer if a metal cutter block was made, and cut copper got more variants, as well as iron and gold cut variants (so useful for builds). Along with this maybe a sawmill block for wood variants. One thought on this that I had is to change the smithing table block to a sort of metal cutter, and reassign the smithing table's function to an alloy furnace. As an alternative, the stonecutter could have its name changed to be more general, and would work with stones, metals, and wood blocks. (we could even get diorite, andesite, and granite block variants, as well as variants for maybe the new tuff, calcite, and slate???)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">7. DarkstalkerMoon, while I have found myself to often disagree with some of your opinions on the feedback site, I definitely do like the idea of lightning striking copper blocks magnetizing them, or other ferromagnetic blocks. It has just the sort of scientific (or at other times historical) accuracy that I enjoy, and would be great fun, especially for some of my parkour courses. As unlikely as this is, as a result of this probably being quite complicated for movement and such, I would LOVE to see this added, and if not this specifically then something similar.</span></li>\n</ul>",

For instance, and I'm just throwing this out here, you could create a tool like \"steel wool\" (made using wool and iron ingot or nuggets) to clean up the oxidation on the copper to revert it back a stage. Like shears this tool would have limited use, so every time you right click on weathered copper it uses the tool up. The tool/item doesn't have to be \"steel wool\" per se, but something to that effect. Plus, in real life, you can clean &amp; de-oxidize copper by scrubbing it (and with some chemicals), so why not in the game? Anyways I'm excited for all the potential uses of copper!</p>",

I see some people on the internet suggesting more decorative copper features, such as copper bars, chains, etc. I would like this. Although, if it does come to pass, I'd like to request gold also receive the same treatment soon after.</p>\n<p>3. This may seem a strange suggestion, but it may be nice to have the option of \"un-weathering\" copper blocks in the world. Something like Sandpaper comes to mind immediately.</p>\n<p>4. Copper's weathering properties are cool, but slow. I understand that you can force it to happen in the real world by using eggs. My idea is this: a recipe of 8 eggs surrounding a copper ingot creates \"Copper Patina.\" This could either be a durability item, allowing you to click on copper blocks to send them to the next step of weathering, or it could be an ingredient to make the solution that exists irl, which would do the same in-game.</p>\n<p>5. I'm disappointed that Drowned no longer drop gold. Netherless skyblock has been badly hurt this day. I appreciate the attempt to make copper renewable/more available, but given how much of it we'll need, is there a better way to make it work? Maybe in addition to iron ingots, Zombies could also drop copper as part of their loot table.</p>",

With 15 sounds and 4 blocks, there is a total of over 15000 combinations. This covers all the items in the game, and even gives room to distinguish between items that are currently not sortable (f.ex. a diamond chestplate gives a different range of sounds than an iron chestplate). The enterprising redstoner could probably use this to create a multitude of novel sorters for unstackable items that would still be a lot harder and slower than current sorters.

As for the dagger idea yeah copper isn’t the best metal to make a dagger from but you still can, sadly there’s nothing else to use copper for. lastly the hatchet some ideas for it would be it could be fast, throwable, maybe damage through shields. perhaps a cross between sheers and a axe? im just trynna find uses for this copper stuff that isn’t redstone ideas.</p>",

In real-life, Bronze was the go- to metal for making weapons, armor, and tools before discovering iron. Also, Bronze is a alloy, made of up of copper and tin. Similarly, Bronze armor &amp; tools in the game could be made up of something like copper &amp; gold or copper &amp; iron. Basically, you could take a golden (or iron chest plate) and combine it with a copper ingot in the Smithing Table to create a Bronze chest plate, (just as you would upgrade your diamond tier set to Netherite). This would be beneficial for the following reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps Bronze tier tools &amp; armor could have the durability of iron, but the effectiveness of gold. For instance, a bronze axe would cut down trees as fast as a gold axe but be much more durable than a gold axe.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Being inferior to diamonds, it wouldn’t impact the eventual need to upgrade to diamond tier mid-late game.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>This would give copper ore more practicality and importance in the game, other than being a decoration block</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I.M.O., Ores are supposed to be essential in crafting recipes and have specific functionality- making tools &amp; armor, cooking, redstone, trading, and enchanting, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<li>It would give players a chance to learn how to use the Smithing Table in the Overworld before crafting their first Netherite set</li>\n<li>It bridges the gap between gold &amp; iron and iron &amp; diamond.</li>\n</ul>",

I would rather like to see it being between iron and diamond tools/armour and be considered a mid-game item. This could be achieved by making the copper armour as durable as diamond but be as tough as iron or vice versa. For the tools, they could be as durable as diamond with the same mining speed as iron or vice versa, and have the sword be as durable as diamond, dealing only as much as an iron sword or yet again, vice versa.</p>\n<p>All of these copper-related tools and armour would keep the same enchanting abilites as gold armour and tools already have to make them more unique, or possibly make the chance of getting a higher enchantment even greater. To make up for this, wearing a copper helmet (or any copper armour at all) could increase the risk of getting struck by lighting during a thunderstorm or rainstorm.</p>\n<p>These ideas would make up for a great mid-game item with unique quirks and abilites, giving copper its own armour and tools which many players (including myself) has been excited about, then disappointed finding out that will not happen. This would also give the smithing table more uses.</p>",

Perhaps sculk could slowly spread throughout caves, corrupting them and making them more dangerous by opening new spawn points for wardens. A realistic way to stop this threat while still preserving the deep dark would be copper shielding. In real life, copper has antimicrobial properties, meaning it kills bacteria and fungi that come into contact with it. Perhaps copper blocks could be immune to sculk growing over them. This adds a new use to copper, while also introducing a dangerous mechanic which encourages players to delve into the depths and fight back against infection.</p>",

Just like the bucket, as the shears get worn down it turns to aged copper. Add copper pipes so that you can move water and lava. For example if you have a lava lake you can put the pipes in it then the pipes will drain the lava into a furnace as a source of fuel. Make sure you put a bucket with lava into the furnace to start the draining process. Another idea is to use copper and turn it into a hammer. By using the hammer you can add cracks to stones materials. Unless you dye the hammer the cracks will be a random color. The cracks would be similar to how ore looks. My last idea is copper cages. Using copper and glass plane you can make a copper cage. This will allow you to capture mobs. Unless the mob is passive then you will get the effects of the mob if you hold it to long.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>I think it's a bit counterintuitive that all other smeltable metal ores can be made into armor, but Copper can't. For a new player, all of these new metals (Not to mention all of the stone variants) could be confusing if they aren't thought out. Granted, Copper isn't a great material for armor, not compared to Iron at least, but perhaps Copper armor could have other uses - Maybe it can be enchanted to be more powerful, like Gold. But adding Copper armor also necessitates extra balancing, and a place in the growing tree of armor types. I think that in order to make adding more metals make sense, they need equipment trees, and in order to make the equipment make sense in the grander scheme, the tier system needs to be overhauled, first.<br><br>My suggestion would be to sort armor into types, and sort them into tiers within those types: For instance, Hard Metals like Iron or Netherite might have the best durability and protection, Soft Metals like Gold and Copper might get better enchantments, and Stone armors like Diamond could have better blast resistance and armor toughness. Then, any new armors that get added will have a natural place in the tree.</p>\n<p>Also, I think that giving the Drowned copper could be a fun - Maybe they're the Sea Peoples who purportedly caused the Bronze Age Collapse, ha ha!</p>",

This would give Redstones the possibility to have vertical \"lines\" for example. Of course anything that can be powered with them will, so they may not the best for compact redstone contraptions but it would be a cool block to use if you need to be somewhere with your redstone line that is more difficult to do with normal Redstone dust + you cant or dont want to use redstone torches to get up.<br><br>Im not a Redstone expert though, but I figured ever since the announcement of Copper, that this form of conductor is ideal to be used with Copper (and btw should only apply to the normal full blocks of copper).<br><br>Potential idea to use the other weathered Copper blocks as less redstone power to travel through.</p>",

(In fact, one of the reasons that people shifted to the Iron Age, despite Bronze's superior hardness, was because the global tin trade was disrupted. Nobody could make Bronze anymore, so they moved to the next best thing.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To effectively implement Copper, I think that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Copper should get its own armor set. Since it is soft and conductive like Gold, it could be an early-game Gold substitute, having greater potential for enchantments.</li>\n<li>In order to make Bronze, we need Tin ore (Cassiterite.) But I think that it would be too much to add yet another block to our already long list of ores, crystals and stone. However, in the real world, Cassiterite can often be found in Granite. So, I think that you should be able to get tin ore from mining Granite, maybe like how you get flint from gravel. Either that, or Tin Ingots could generate in chests as loot.</li>\n<li>To balance Bronze, I propose that it be a \"secret\" side-branch tool/armor set, having the same (or a little more power) than Iron, but more durability, to reward players for bringing the lackluster Copper to its full potential.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The actual Bronze Ingot-making could be done on a crafting table, or, even better, on a smithing table.</p>",

Tbh I basically did everything, found everything in the new update except go to the end. However, that took me like 2 weeks an average of 4 hours a day to accomplish and yet I only had maybe 5 stacks of copper blocks by then. What if I wanted to make a Greek temple but I had to spend a month (no matter my fortune 3) just to find and tap every copper resource I could find. It's pretty rare tbh unless you find a cave, so then the question becomes how much will copper ores spawn in the new caves? Based on 21w14a I'm not seeing much at all. Please, for the sake of survival increase the spawn rate for copper ores. While I've got your attention, please add blue and green lava please and thank you (blue lava under oceans and green lava in foggy swamp biomes).</p>",

I'll try anyways.</p>\n<p>Like others have said before me, copper just really seems to take up more inventory space than it's actually worth as of this moment. I don't think we need any copper tiers of tools/weapons/armor as the tier system in place is already fine, however I would like to see more uses for copper than just a building material.</p>\n<p>For example, like <em>DarkStalkerMoon</em> mentioned, adding in copper pipes could be an incredible addition for the game. My idea is, rather than use them for decoration, maybe use them in tangent with maybe some sort of water pump block to slowly pump water out of a given water source into another area (except in cases like the ocean or in sources bigger than a 32x32 area). Copper pipes can also be used on hoppers to carry items across long distances or even vertically upwards (something that I was a little upset about with normal hoppers).</p>\n<p>It can also be extremely useful in adding copper wires (2 redstone dusts and a copper ingot aligned vertically on the crafting bench to make 4) for redstone. These could travel vertically, able to fit at least 3-4 wires within a given block, and can attach themselves directly from a side of a block and bend 90 degrees to any 4 directions (up, down, sideways). It'd basically be like redstone dust, but 3-Dimensional.</p>\n<p>I have no idea if that has already been suggested, but it's worth a shot.</p>",

Vanilla lock for chests:\n<br />We already have locked chests in minecraft, they are just inaccessible in vanilla minecraft. So a copper lock item could be renamed and if right clicked on a chest, would lock it with the name of that lock (and it will be consumed).\n<br />Nothing happens if the lock isn't named, and any item with the name the lock had will work to open the chest.\n<br />To accompany this, locked chests should prevent hoppers from pulling out items, but would drop its items upon breaking.</p>\n\n<p>2. Lock &amp; Key items:\n<br />We cannot craft locks, but instead craft \"lock and key\", which would lock a chest when right clicked, giving the user a key item back that is linked to that chest.\n<br />These locked chests are an entirely different mechanic from the locked chests already in the game and will only open to the key with which it was originally locked (it can be renamed without changing this functionality).</p>\n\n<p>I thought about letting locked chests drop themselves when broken, but this would make them work too much like Shulker boxes... Another possibility is for them to drop nothing at all, but that might be even worse than dropping everything on the ground. </p>",

As it's hard to come up with something completely new that is useful and that people will want to mine copper for.\n<br />I personally think I'll completely avoid mining copper, as I don't want to build my house out of it. And I probably am not the only one. \n<br />If this is the way copper should be, then don't add more crafting recipes. But if you want copper to be an interesting item for users, consider changing some of the current iron (and gold) recipes to use copper instead.\n<br />This is to nerf iron and gold farms a bit, but also will balance the game more, as iron is currently the most important resource to get a hold on when you start the game, so you are lacking behind if you don't build an iron farm.. \n<br />Changing some iron recipes to copper may not always make sense, but it will help the balance of the game. </p>",

Lightning rods and spyglasses are wonderful, balanced, and great additions to the game. However it is a little disappointing that they those are the only non decorative purposes for copper. This is made extra clear because of how absurdly common copper ore is, and that it always drops at least 2 raw copper.</p>\n<p>I know that it's too late now to suggest major features for 1.18, however if possible, it would be nice if there were something that players might constantly need copper for. Every other ore in the game has the possibility for constant use. Coal as fuel, emeralds for trading, iron for so many useful things, lapis for enchanting, redstone for contraptions, diamonds for armor and tools, and of course netherite as the strongest material for upgrading and repairing things (Of course it's so rare that almost no one has a lot of excess netherite). Copper, however, doesn't get this. Spyglasses have no durability, and you only need so many lightning rods to protect a house, not to mention non wooden houses don't need lightning rods anyways. Armor and tools would be unnecessary, and I dont think that copper should replace iron for any existing recipes. Im sure that if it's going to be done, in 1.18, the devs would already be working on it, but if nothing comes out with the update, it'd be great to add some kind of use so that you dont only need 5 ingots before it becomes decoration only.</p>",

Copper should charge copper blocks using lighning rods. These charged copper blocks, when walked onto by mobs, electrocute them and deal 8 points of damage. But if walked on by creepers, they get charged. And if they are walked on by skeletons, they summon skeletons on horses with a different color.</p>\n\n<p>2. Copper armour and weapons.\n<br />Now this armour would be made more powerful if dropped on charged copper blocks. But without electricity, they do not give the player any shock attack, nor give the player speed that is limited. Also, charged copper tipped arrows, swords and possibly a new weapon, a hammer, could deliver a new shockwave attack.</p>\n\n<p>3. Batteries.\n<br />Yes, Batteries. What if you just wnat to store electricity into batteries from lightning strikes? You could use these batteries to charge your armour, either through a battery powered armour machine or just by upgrading the armour onto a smithing table using a battery.</p>\n\n<p>Batteries could also be used to craft new blocks, like radio transmitters with use of sculk sensors, teleportation paltforms using eyes of ender, batteries, redstone and certain blocks to craft teleportation platforms.</p>",

So far, I've actually avoided mining copper for the most part, because it just takes up inventory space - Which is really disappointing.</p>\n<p>I kind of see parallels between it and gold, and not just because the two are both soft, conductive metals - Gold didn't used to have much of a role in a standard playthrough either, aside from decoration and better enchantments. But after 1.16, gold became extremely useful, being necessary to interact with Piglins in the Nether and to craft Netherite.</p>\n<p>Adding a copper tool tier would be a hassle. It would mean tons of re-balancing, re-ordering the sequence of the game for the longer, and for little gameplay value in return. But without some kind of special use, copper risks becoming an inventory freeloader. The Drowned could help copper the way Piglins helped gold. I think that associating the two was a good idea, and that the devs should run with it! For instance, tridents already have the appearance of oxidized copper. Copper be part of a new trident crafting recipe. Maybe copper could be traded with fisherman villagers, or copper tools, if they're added, could be faster in water (like having aqua affinity)!</p>",

Froglights are yet another cool lighting block players can only get in the Nether.There are still very few nice decorative lighting blocks for the early stages of the game, which is frustrating when you're trying to decorate builds or make fitting houses for villages. Copper lanterns would make a great complement to iron ones, especially now iron is rarer so already-expensive iron lanterns become even more of a waste of resources early game.</p>",

It's a shame because I like that copper, iron, and gold are in the same game. Copper should be an electricity and heat conductor like in real life, while redstone becomes alternative fuel to coal. If copper stays in the game, it has to offer something great to the game. If possible, it can be used to craft cauldrons, brewing stands, and anything that's a must have in the game.</p>",

It would be kind of annoying for them to be not stackable, people probably wouldn't use it much. But I like the snow bucket mechanic so much that maybe there could be another type of \"snowier snow,\" a flowing snow like water &amp; lava. It would bring similar cold effects and would have the same bucket mechanics. Maybe it could flow faster than water, and be able to freeze more lava, or at least also turn lava into obsidian. Plus it would be cool for a new fluid to finally be introduced.</p>",

It would be nice if there was some sort of visual indicator that a mob is freezing, maybe have entities turn blue, or have ice particles appear around them?&nbsp; Second, I feel that it would be fitting if, along with the slowness effect, strays would have a chance to freeze you temporarily which leads to my last thing. Similarly to fire aspect or flame, there could maybe be ice aspected enchantments that could temporarily freeze the target, incompatible with the fire ones. It could be a treasure enchantment, maybe found rarely in igloos. Just a few ideas, though I find the first one most important.</p>",

Additionally I think the freezing effect should last longer after you get out of the snow. Other possibilities to make the effect more unique may possibly include the freezing effect preventing regeneration when it is on. Additionally I still think Frost Walker should be what allows you to walk on the snow instead of leather boots, and I think leather armor should be what prevents the freezing effect. It doesn't make sense for leather boots to allow you to walk on powdered snow since their surface area should be the equivalent of all other boots in the game. However I do believe it makes sense for frostwalker since its main function is freezing the water beneath you to walk upon it, in other words in would freeze the powdered snow more to make it more solid so you can walk on it. Additionally at the current moment frostwalker isn't that practical due to you being able to simply navigate faster in a boat, and frost walker its literally in the name. Of course one may have to under these circumstances make it so one of the enchantments mobs can spawn with in snowy biomes is frostwalker.</p>",

This would be weaker in just a cold biome, slightly stronger during snowfall and super strong if in powdered snow. It would also be nice if a campfire could get rid of this effect in a small area around it. Also, it would be interesting if a hot effect were applied if you use this armor in the nether or other hot biomes.&nbsp;</p>",

I think in a cold biome, if you aren't near a light source for a long enough time, the frosty edges should begin to creep onto the screen and if you don't put down a torch or campfire soon you'll start to freeze. Similar to powder snow, leather armor would increase the amount of time it takes to freeze, with full leather armor fully protecting you from freezing. During the daytime freezing wouldn't happen nearly as quickly, if at all. During a snowstorm, freezing would happen more quickly. </p>\n<p>Mainly, I think this would provide ambience to cold biomes more than anything. It wouldn't be too hard for a player to wear a bit of leather or to put down a torch for a bit when they get cold, and even if they do start to freeze, freezing damage is really slow. But the effect of a dark night with snow rushing in front of your face and the frost appearing on the edges of your screen indicating imminent danger I think would be amazing.</p>",

As it stands, frostbite is something that could easily just be replaced with suffocation damage, and having to wear any amount of leather armor is just such an incredible burden that no one is going to actually bother to do so, especially when the only benefit is to not take an amount of damage that is so slow that you can easily survive indefinitely just off of saturation from food alone if you are trapped in the powdered snow.</p>\n<p>In addition, I seems as though it can't be picked up and removed through normal methods like a shovel or fists right now, so this makes it an incredibly toxic mechanic for trolling if it stays this way. If you trap a new player in powdered snow that has nothing on them, if the snow is two blocks deep they have no possible way to free themselves. They just have to sit there for 2 minutes and wait for the frostbite to kill them. And if someone goes so far as to give them full leather armor with curse of binding on it through dispensers, they will be stuck there forever with no way to die. (except hunger, maybe.)</p>\n<p>As of right now the enire concept of this item is somehow both overpowered and underpowered at the same time, and without change it will be one of the worst items in the game made so far imo.</p>",

Magma Cubes have the innate power to remain superheated in any climate, <br>so they would melt back into a semisolid after leaving the powder snow, allowing it to <br>continue moving again.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Snow Golems should have unique functionality with powder snow, being able to stand on the block, and would be unable to melt in hot biomes while in contact with the block</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Snow Golems are really only useful for obtaining snow layers, as they can only harm <br>Blazes. Neither of which it can do in hot biomes like deserts and the Nether. At <br>least being able to obtain snowballs from them if your house is in a desert would be a <br>nice addition, and if they had a way to survive in a nether fortress using it, it would give <br>players new creative ways to tackle it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Water should not destroy powder snow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>From a realistic perspective, it makes sense that water destroys powder snow, but <br>from a gameplay perspective, it may limit the creativity of some players.

Early game mining for resources such as diamonds will be more difficult and will take lot more effort and could be demotivating. Going from above ground to under ground could be challenging as well(Early game). Lighting up caves also could be a challenge. Also reaching for ores generated in the ceiling could be annoying after a while. Early game mining without good gear and enchantments will make caving something players might avoid, to get good gear we have to do caving early game. Bedrock at y =0 is perfect -64 is way too deep. When I first saw the new caves I was so amazed and blown away, I was so happy. The developers have done an amazing job but after a while I started releasing small things like I mentioned above. Hope this was helpful in any way.</p>",

Just want to put that out there because I want larger caves I do but sometimes I think this is a little bit overkill tbh also I could barely find any surface caves where I could starting mining in a survival snapshot world and it took me like 2 days to get iron because I had to dig down also diamond placement needs to be fixed because down below with so much open blocks it's so easy finding diamonds. Furthermore, there is literally no lava pools underground, I can't find one piece of obsidian because of that</p>",

I think we should keep iron as-is, because currently it is too easy to get as the start of the game. I think this would be a great time to rethink the spawn placement of the overworld ores as you'll have to change it anyway :)</p>\n<p><x-zendesk-user data-user-name=\"WillyWonka9763\">410903178892</x-zendesk-user>&nbsp;I think that these \"problems\" were intended and are important to have. Early-Game cave Mining is way too easy right now, the only problems being a couple of skeletons and the occasional lava stream you can bridge over. With huge Caverns, mining is more scary and adventurous, which is something i think almost everyone wants :)</p>\n<p>I would LOVE to see glow squids generate in underground lakes, as well as much larger patches of lichen that generate more closer to water.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The only thing I'm skeptical about in this update are the aquifiers. I think that underground lakes and rivers would be a much cooler thing to add than the flooded caves, but that's just me. I also think that the underground rivers/lakes can come with a new plant (or maybe just generate with one of the lush caves plants) and also have more dirt, moss, and glow lichen.</p>\n<p>All in all, this was a much better snapshot than 21w05a, and I hope you continue with work like this!</p>",

I think I can give some feedback after playing with them for awhile, I've found a few issues with them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Here's what I hope changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aquifers or water bodies have strange delimitations to them and seem to be able to carve into each other. It looks unnatural, you end up with unfinished or floating walls of stone on top of lakes. I'd expect the delimiations to go all the way down.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Caves are so gosh darn big that you can&nbsp;sometimes see the fog from daylight/sunset/nighttime with a low enough render distance. You can tell the time of day. Maybe caves should have black fog, especially if they end up becoming their own biome!</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Neighboring caves take up a lot more of the mob cap, it'd be worth considering shortening the spawn range from 128 blocks to 96 blocks. Especially for technical players. I think that would help a lot to reduce how much players will have to spawn-proof or light up and could even serve to increase difficulty a bit.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Geodes really look out of place, and maybe shouldn't surface and be rarer. They should be reserved for upcoming new diamond level.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I miss Ocean Ravines, man! They were pretty cool, especially with the magma floors.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here's what I loved or hopes stays the same!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aquifers are awesome! Really fun to play around in. I almost drowned a few times while getting greedy. It improves the early game, everything feels fresh.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Deeper caves!!! And the size is awesome.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If iron spawned lower down, it could make progression a lot more interesting! Same with lapis.</li>\n</ul>",

Exploring a large series of small caves is fun, and would help take advantage of the new world depth.</li>\n<li>Make the transition between caves and aquifers more smooth: Aquifers and caves are only separated by about 1 block, making them look very floaty and unnatural. The wall between caves and aquifers should be at least 5 blocks thick. Also, transitions between different local water levels should be less common and more significant; it can be annoying when you're rafting in a cave and you're stopped by a single bar of stone because the local water level changed by 1 block.</li>\n</ul>",

Setting the Y value of sea level to be 0 would mimic this and be a great way for the player base to know their relative positions.</p>\n<p>With this change the total height of the world would not change but give the player base a nicer way to read and understand their position.</p>\n<p><strong>y&nbsp;&nbsp; 256&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sky height (max height)</strong></p>\n<p><strong>y &nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sea level</strong></p>\n<p><strong>y&nbsp;&nbsp; -127&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bedrock (max depth)</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you, and keep up the great work dev team!!</p>",

The lichen some-what helps but honestly the caves are really in need of a some-what natural or significant light source to add to the over-all experience when in the caves that isnt a block that the player can use, but helps with the experience when inside caves, like a glowing mushroom.</p>\n<p>-Theres alot of statements on twitter about lowering the level in which diamonds spawn due to how overpowering the rate at which they are obtained has become. I fully agree diamonds should be somewhat lowered in level and perhaps spawn less often in general.</p>\n<p>-in the water caves there isn't any underwater vegetation such as seagrass, kelp, sea pickles and etc. Atleast not that i have seen, i think that underwater vegetation needs to be added along with an increased rate of which sea pickles spawn underwater in order to help with the light source issues players will now be experiencing when inside the caves.</p>\n<p>-personally i would now love to find \"underground villages\" or an \"abandoned village\" type of structure in the caves, i think new structures being introduced underground can greatly benefit from all the space thats been added into the caves and it would help with the experience.</p>",

Another thing that might be cool is glow worms or another glow block to go along side of the glow lichen,&nbsp;because the caves are so big(which I really like), glow lichen and possibly these *new* blocks/mobs could generate in larger clumps. I also think that the new cabes are generating too frequently, I think that the new cave biomes should generate specifically to the size of the caves. The dripstone caves should generate in the largest caves, the lush caves should generate in the medium/small caves, as well as the deep dark. Thanks Devs!!! Keep it up!</p>",

As far as I understood it looks like that the generation system as problems with seamless cave intersection but instead cuts them and block the intersection, i think you should have a look.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the rest given it is the first cave snapshot i think the new generation is a amazing and with a few tweaks here and there it will be just perfect!!!</p>",

Some other options might be some kind of enhanced version of the spyglass that effectively uses night vision, however I doubt people would love feeling the need to scan over an enormous cave slowly and methodically with a spyglass.

The world feels awesome and filled with wonder in the way it first felt when first playing it as a kid. There are a few little thoughts however I would love to add as part of my excitement for whats to come.</p>\n\n<p>I would love to see some of the sea grass in the Aquifers, maybe in diminishing amounts at deeper levels.\n<br />I would love to see the water biome color tints independent to what aquifer they’re in, instead of which biome is above.\n<br />I think the glow lichen should be much more abundant in or around the watery areas because they would likely thrive on the moisture, plus it come on, wouldn’t that look cool. \n<br />Lastly I would love the see there be a few less mine shafts, and have them focus on connecting large caves or having some sort of path to lead you to something cool like a geode or a large ore vein or maybe some of that wacky archeology business you guys have coming; instead of just snaking around like caves themselves. \n<br />That’s all I have to add. I cannot wait to see what you all are working on! This game has been my favorite game for half of my life. I do not even under stand how it hasn’t gotten old, it must be magic or something. Thank you guys for always putting your all into amazing new features!\n<br />- long time fan</p>",

Especially the dripstone patches. There should be more blend between the stone types. Perhaps the blotches could be significantly bigger, or even small \"micro-biomes\" of the stone types</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- The stone \"dams\" separating local water levels don't look natural enough. IMO they need to be more cylindrical, and more importantly have a couple layers of stone penetrate the water instead of the water \"slicing\" off the bottom.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;- Amethyst geodes should be significantly more rare. And amethyst needs more uses, maybe something like a new powerful late-game light source to properly light up these massive caverns</p>\n<p>- The mob spawning algorithm really needs some reworking due to all the new space these caves are creating. Getting to the lower levels was not as challenging as I would've liked. De-spawning rules should be more aggressive</p>\n<p>- Glow Lichen should come in small patches, and be reserved for the deep aquifers and caverns, not regular caves</p>\n<p>- The progression to iron is&nbsp;<em>wayyy too quick&nbsp;</em>IMO. It's really easy to have full iron tools and armor by the end of the first day. Iron ore's distribution should be pushed down a few Y levels, and a bit rarer near the surface, to incentivize caving and making stone tools not completely irrelevant by the second day.</p>",

I think the intense blue water doesn't go well with the stone around it. I'd love to see a new color for water while in caves, like a more murky and desaturated hue for caves to make it blend in more. Maybe different cave biomes can have their own watercolor? Like the dripstone caves are a more grey-pink color to match the dripstone blocks? I understand this can affect underground buildings, but I strongly believe that if the water matches, it can look amazing.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you for your hard work. &lt;3</p>",

So the larger caves should be like finding a jungle biome or a mesa, not nearly as rare as that, but a reward for exploring and not the norm of the landscape.</p>\n<p>Another thing- I find the transition between aquifers of the same level jarring, there are no waterfalls between them, making them hard to boat down in one go. The walls between them floating and not going all the way down breaks the semi realism and makes them seem detached from reality.</p>\n<p>Something else- There should be vegetation spawning in the aquifers, such as sea grass, lily pads, Sea pickles(to help with lighting) or even kelp. Vines could go from the ceilings and sprawl down to the floor. I also think Fish spawning in the aquifers and ice forming at mid Y levels before the lava would be neat, just to give a sense of vertical progression (ice, then lava, then deep dark).

This could make actual caving rather tedious as one would just go from vein to vein, pillaring up, mining 4 ores. Pillaring down, Repeat</p>\n<p>My suggestion is, the deeper you go, make ores a lot rarer but also let them spawn in groups of veins . An ideal situation would be to having to explore the noise caves to than find a huge wall with some iron ores exposed to the outside, mining into this wall and around it will uncover more iron ore veins. If these vein groups are large enough it could even be worth setting up a mining outpost</p>\n<p><strong>Mobs: </strong></p>\n<p>It was already so that large caves could easily be very dangerous because of many mobs being in them. I fear that the Noise caves could be so dangerous that many players in survival would rather avoid them.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I think this might be the right update to introduce some new mechanics to deal with mobs in less violent way. Maybe something like a bright flair could halt spawning in a big radius or some other ways to repel or stay hidden from mobs.</p>\n<p><strong>Navigation:</strong></p>\n<p>Noise Caves are dark, difficult to light up, laddering up works well but down not so much, Scaffolding is nice but proper cave navigation shouldn't depend on having found bamboo.</p>\n<p>flair, height sensor, rope.

You could have a creek that has carved out its little path down into the surrounding landscape slightly (as it would naturally). This would be at the level of the local water table, and if it were to go towards an area of raised land, it would carve its way down into the side, and be the entrance to a cave system. The lakes could be somewhat similar. Other than these two types of cave entrances, the two that could be kept from before would be sinkholes and ravines, being formed by natural tectonic processes. If you wanted to improve the realism of oceans further, you could have something like a mid-ocean ridge, with its own little biome with heat vents and a set of blocks or mobs that live in the hot environment (worms?). the counterpart to this (already in the game) is the oceanic trenches, where plates are subducted. I have to admit, it wouldn't be terribly hard to do this if you just chose these biomes for an ocean at random, but it could be considerably harder if you actually made accurate tectonics. I seem to have gotten off on a tangent, but an accurate cave entrance would be cool, and it looks like you guys have made some crucial steps in that direction.</p>",

        "body": "<p>Problem I've encountered with the new cave system: Because they are so large now, I find it harder to explore them when first digging down from the surface. It seems to me that in order to get into the caves without taking falling damage, or dying from falling to high, you need to have gravel, sand, or scaffolding. These only work by placing blocks until they stack up to your height, but then you have to dig down again to lower yourself. That's why I think a new item/block is needed to help us safely lower ourselves in the new caves like a rope. In real life, spelunkers &amp; cave explorers uses ropes to safely repel themselves down into the depths of the cave. Ropes would be useful in this case because we are coming in from the top down, not the bottom up. By placing a rope on the side of a block in front of us and the rope auto-extending to the bottom, we could have a much easier way to get down into the new caves. In a sense, it is like the opposite of a ladder, which can only be placed climbing upwards: we need something that can be placed upwards to help us get down. It functions basically like a water bucket, which is right now the only thing we have to lower ourselves from great heights without taking damage, but something like a rope would seem more purposeful and definitely help us adjust to exploring this new type of cave system. Keep up the good work guys!</p>",

I suggest that either the massive aquifers are rarer, or we get a new way to clear out water in the coming update.<br><br>Another thing I'm concerned about is farm optimization, because in the new caves, lighting everything up could take ages. I think this could be a good time to add a suggestion I've seen before a few times: a beacon effect that prevents mob spawns in its radius. This way it's still a lot of work to attain, but would be very rewarding for farm optimization. This could also open up a lot of opportunities for players to make dark bases without having to worry about mob spawns.</p>",

But I mostly use night vision for it, as in my opinion, the caves are still too dark. Lichen definetly help, but if you enter a big cave you will only see the few illuminated spots, while you won't be able to admire the rest of it without going through the trouble of lighting the whole thing up. I think this can be solved by making blocks at a distance appear brighter than those closeby. That way, the small caves will remain pretty much the same, as will the night on the surface, since even at moody lighting, everything is farely visible. And to be clear, I'm not suggesting increasing the light level at a distance, just making it appear slightly brighter to the player. I think it really would make caves much more enjoyable in early survival.</p>",

Before it was easy enough to find really long cave networks of many caves connecting, eventually leading you to the bottom of the world without breaking a single block. To make this happen in the new caves as well, eighter the old caves should spawn bellow y 0 or the new caves need to be longer to have more intersections.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In summary, Big caves are now too rare/not big enough and the new caves don't connect enough.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>P.S.

The andesite/granite/diorite as well as ores should certainly spawn in a more vein like or layer like fashion. In regard to diamond spawn rate, it should still be much rarer. Even in 1.16.5 I feel that diamonds are two easy to acquire, as just a quick staircase down and you can have diamonds in five minutes, with more to come through some strip mining. Diamonds should be far rarer, also allowing for new more common things or tiers, maybe. Glow lichen should spawn in larger patches for lighting and aesthetic appeal. The transition between aquifers and the wall thickness between caves need to be improved from what I have seen flying around in spectator. It would make more sense if we just put 0 as sea level. Finally, I am worried that the underground is still to small. To truly make caves and cave biomes feel right, we need to have enough space for&nbsp;<strong>3</strong> cave biomes to be layered on top of each other. Finally, a light filled mushroom biome to top off the update.</p>",

Maybe you can't light up the whole caves to prevent all mob spawning, and that is a good thing.</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">More Choices early game : Save coal for smelting ores or use coal for more torches? We have become used to light up all areas of the caves but, maybe mining got too comfortable, and I like the idea of the caves being so big there almost impossible to light up every area ( unless you are very dedicated).</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">I also like the idea of Potions like Invisibility and Night vision being used for mining.

I've generated many worlds for testing, and could only find a handful of decently large caves, and only 1 or 2 of them came even close to matching the previous cave's sizes. So maybe, their rarity could be toned down just a little, or at the very least have the ones we find be bigger more often. But, IMO, a more important issue came up with the removal of a lot of the large caves. It's caused much of the new underground to be pretty much empty, especially compared to the old cave systems above. I'm sure it's probably in the pipeline, but the old cave generation appearing below y=0 would go a long way in filling the large gaps that exist currently.</p>\n<p>As a matter of fact, having more blending of the old and new cave generation in general would go a long way to make the underground a better place for exploring. As it stands, you mainly have the new cave generation closer to the surface, and all the new cave types down in the grim stone, with the only caves intersecting the two parts being deep diving spaghetti caves. I'd like to be able to use the older caves to have more paths to travel between larger caves deep underground, or have a surprise cheese cavern that is exposed to the surface, making essentially a large crater in the ground, etc.</p>",

Why have a cave update and change the world depth if the underground is just going to be about as empty as 1.16? Sure the noise caves can still get huge, but most of them are just large tunnels. It also doesn't help that smaller caves generate exactly the same way they do in 1.16, leaving the underground very empty.

It would have a unique function too, allowing boats to flow over it as if it were water. Basically, if a boat was on water and was on the same height as the top block of flowstone, the boat would pass over the flowstone, unlike other solid blocks. This would only work going downwards however, as the flowstone block would have to have an exposed top for boats to pass over (therefore acting almost like a sort of stone waterfall).</p>\n<p>I think this should be added as it would give more purpose and use to the boat aside from just going across oceans.

I do not know much of how it forms but I assume it occurs in static bodies of water, which is likely a common occurrence in caves that are not exposed to the weather. It occurs where brine water sits below freshwater, and creates the illusion that there is air above the brine water due to their different refractive properties.</p>\n<p>If this post is in the wrong topic, please do not delete it, just move to the right one.</p>\n<p>Thanks.</p>",

In the current state there are very few of them generating but what I think should address a lot of generation weirdness and cave gen being unbalanced is the following: the old cave type should generate more than now (like being 30-35 per cent of caves) and in let's say in 30 per cent of cases they should create the \"old\" caves and in the other 70 they could be used to create a \"network\". The old caves in \"network\" use case could go up or down a bit inand mostly be horizontal (with the up and down component like bringing you 10-15 blocks lower if you go across it) and they should interesect into bigger caves \"the new ones\"... continuing on page 2</li>\n</ol>",

No big caves like in the first cave snapshot (Mr. Kniberg said he will add them back in next snapshot so I will wait to see how it goes).</p>\n<p>4. The grimstone caves do not use the full limit downwards in a lot of generation, many stop at around -20 height and do not go down to -64, but of course also this piece of feedback needs to correlete with how and where deep dark will generate, so no further ideas or options about grimstone caves now.</p>\n<p>5. Not so many caves with stalagmites and stalactites?</p>\n<p>6. The geodes containing amethists could be tweaken in the way they generate with the opening: a lot of them spawn with a part in open areas but a lot of time that part is not the opening but is the closed part of the shell: you could make more likely for geodes who spawn inside a cave to have the opening in the exposed area, and perhaps have them be a full sphere when genereta fully buried.</p>\n<p>7.

        "body": "<p>A few changes that should be made to the cave generation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Having deepslate is great, and it is already slightly harder to mine, but it should be even more difficult. In normal stone, I generally mine with a large quantity of stone and one ore two iron picks for ores. It would work well, provide more progression, and make mining lower down more difficult. I would like to see mining time increased to 1.5-1.75 times that of normal stone.</li>\n<li>One feature that I have felt should change for a while is silverfish. Infested stone currently only generates under mountain biomes, but with the separation of the underground from the above ground, as well as the fact that it is an interesting and engaging feature that could provide challenge in more areas and get widespread use, it should be able to generate anywhere. This would also come with an infested deepslate variant.</li>\n<li>While the current ore distribution is okay, it could be much better. It seems very similar to how it used to be, and this is a time to make ore rarity better, not just to conform it to fit the new caves. First of all, I would decrease iron rarity by a third to half of its current rarity. Copper should remain the same, and gold should go down by about 1/4. Redstone could be slightly rarer, coal is fine for now. Diamond should be cut to half its current rarity. It is far too easy to acquire for the highest tier (excluding netherite, which it directly bridges to).</li>\n</ul>",

For an optimal experience that feels like cave biomes, the caves must be large enough to hold 3 cave biomes stacked on top of each other. With each cave biome area holding its own multiple caves stacked on top of each other, a decent estimate would be 64 blocks of vertical space for a cave biome, plus some. By this, the underground would need an additional 64 blocks of space, which the sky would likely get too, bringing it to a 512 block height limit.</li>\n<li>Finally, cave biomes. We currently have three confirmed cave biomes, as well as mesh caves, which sounds more like generation than a biome. With the deep dark predominantly generating at the bottom of the world, it might not feel like much of a biome, and more a part of the world. If some sort of lava/magma oriented biome was added, it would keep the challenge of the deep dark, though in its own way, and would together with the plain biome, add some variety to that layer. For middle biomes, a giant mushroom grotto like biome, which many have requested, would work excellently, with a nice magical feel.</li>\n<li>I recognize that this would be a lot of work to do, but I am sure the developers would be able to pull it off. I would be easily willingly to wait longer for it, even pushing the release date up into late August or September if necessary, if we could get two more cave biomes.</li>\n</ul>",

I'm okay with the cave sizes in 21w08a, but I do feel like large caves are just, everywhere, and maybe that's okay! But perhaps, if more small variants of caves were added, we could have slightly less large caves.</p>\n<p>The crack carvers are great! One thing I'm a little disappointed in, though, is that they usually generate from the surface level down to about y=0. They seem to never generate at negative y levels. Also, I was really hoping for crack carvers to be able to generate sideways and diagonally. They should generate upright most of the time, but it'd be great to get horizontal ones.</p>\n<p>Finally, it's really nice that we have a lava level now. However, it is disappointingly low down. Lava is very rarely found in some of the larger caves, as they usually don't go low enough. If the lava level were raised by 10, or even 5 blocks, that would be a massive improvement in my eyes.</p>",

Not only would this make deeper mining more difficult and match up with the ore versions, but it would also incentivize using mainly iron pickaxes for mining further down, and add a better sense of progression. In fact, I feel that to truly pull it off, it might be best to make it 3 layers, with a 1x layer of normal stone, then a 1.5x layer of something else where deepslate currently is, and then a 2x layer which deepslate would moved to, for both base stone and ores. This would really add a nice sense of progression, and yes, it would require the underground to be deeper. In any case, even if it still remains 2 layers, deepslate should have higher mining time.</p>",

How this would work would be that in some large areas of chunks that generate deepslate lower than -1, so some bigger caves can be made more out of regular stones. There's nothing wrong with deepstate, but I just want to see a swiss cheese cave made out of stone for once.</p>",

It would be rather unexciting because I would meet very few mobs. And hour of strip mining would give me the same amount, if not maybe a little more, diamonds.</p>\n\n<p>Now, as I mentioned, I spend an hour killing hundreds of mobs, nearly dying several times, all for 1 diamond. I love that it's difficult! I just want to actually get something from all my near death experiences. Seriously, strip mining is way safer, and yields more ores for your time.</p>\n\n<p>I shouldn't have to trade fun for resources. When I need ores, I shouldn't have to decide \"should I do it the fun way, risk the high chances of death, and get barely any ores at all? Or should I just get way more ores without risking death?\". Easy choice.</p>\n\n<p>People think that many ores being exposed in caves means it's extremely easy to get ores in caves. There's still the same amount of ores! Except now, when you see an ore, you have to walk to the other end of the cave (because there's so few, they're usually far away), and build up 30 blocks to the ceiling.</p>",

In one I found more iron in a village and desert temple then I did in a series of caves I had explored. In another I managed to find gold and redstone in a cave before I found a single piece of iron ore. This makes it really difficult to actually play the game, as iron is such an important item to have in the game, especially early on (not to mention that you need iron to actually get gold and diamond). The one or two times I have found iron, it was in groups of one to five, which is barely enough to do anything with.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Copper and coal, on the other hand, are plentiful. In fact, finding stacks of copper without doing much mining, whilst finding basically no iron seems quite odd. I'm not saying that copper should be more rare, seeing as it has a use as a building block, but iron should be at least half as common as copper, if not just as common. I don't have any comments to make about the other ores, as I found most of them before iron, so they're probably fine.&nbsp;</p>",

Water caves tend to refuse to connect to other caves or surfaces, even when they are right next to each other (non-water caves do this too, but to a much lesser extent). This is most evident in Ocean biomes, where the ocean floor is extremely broken up and almost no cave entrances form, due to the caves rarely ever connecting to the sea floor. From what I can gather just from my observations, I think the main issue comes from the fact that non-water caves try to form a barrier whenever they come in contact with water.</p>\n<p>One way that I can see this being fixed is flooding any cave that comes in contact with a body of water/water cave. While this might cause too many caves to be filled with water, I don't think it will, as water caves tend to be very rare, and as for oceans, I don't think having all the caves that are near an ocean being full of water is really an issue, as it just make sense and helps players who are looking specifically for water caves.</p>",
