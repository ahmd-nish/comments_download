Both leads had broke simultaneously. But I managed to find only one. After one game day I lost Mule too, because of same reason.</p>\n<p>This bug (or feature?) totally kills Horses and Lamas part of the game. You can use horses and Laman on your continent, but you should not take them with you overseas.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>To solve this I suggest:</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1) Leads must play warning sound when it about to break.</p>\n<p>2) When you have mob on the Lead, you should see status effect icon, showing which mob currently on the Lead, and how many mobs of that type.</p>\n<p>If you have one lama and two mules, two icons are shown: Lama icon with number 1, and Horse icon with number 2.</p>\n<p>3) Larger boats which can carry big mobs, such as Horses, Lamas, Mules (no Leads need at all)</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But I would prefer if Leads never break.</p>",
