Unfortunately the current durability penalty can consume the lower tier spears in just few uses, making the setup useless in survival gameplay. Removing or Altering how the durability penalty is handled would remedy the issue and make the lunge enchantment the explorer's new best friend.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For the alternative ways of handling thee durability i propose:</p>\n<p>the durability penalty scaling with the weapon tier instead of enchantment tier as it is now, the heavier the spear the more durability lunge consumes with wood consuming almost none and ntherite consuming the most, maybe even more than the current penalty. (logically consistent as all the spear tiers share the same handle material so it makes sense that heavier tips would put more strain on the humble stick)</p>\n<p>Durability being consumed on dealing damage and hitting a block (rather intuitive as it would be consistent with the way other tools handle, and also \"why would it be damaged from literally poking the air?\")</p>",
