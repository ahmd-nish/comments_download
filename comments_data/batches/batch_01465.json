Perhaps the horse can become exhausted if ridden for more than <em>x</em> minutes, where <em>x</em> is the horse's max health or stamina value.</li>\n<li>\n<em>Giving horses their own hunger bar</em>&nbsp;is an alternative to stamina, and might give purpose to the useless feeding animation now that they have a reason to eat grass. If their hunger is low, the horse cannot move at full speed, similar to players' sprint.</li>\n<li>If a horse is dying from hunger, there must be a unique damage sound or animation. It shouldn't be confused with other effects like Wither or Poison.</li>\n<li>Adding a hunger bar for horses might demand consistency to add this feature to every other animal, but from a lore perspective this merely demonstrates the bond between player and horse.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Horses&nbsp;<em>shouldn't</em> be able to do sharp turns without losing momentum</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Yaw turns should be done in a manner similar to boats.</li>\n</ul>",

Imagine riding across the savanna on horseback while being able to look around and enjoy the view. I should be able to tilt my head to the side and do drive by attacking without losing momentum with a horse just like on boats. The only downside of riding horseback would then be the inability to strafe (and water). The devs could copy/paste the boat controls into horse controls.</p>\n<p>I think it would make horse riding more enjoyable. Riding along the plains. Circling mobs while attacking. Falling into holes because we were looking at that mountain in the distance.</p>",

It may summon souls as well; living straightline projectiles, that bypass all physical barriers, countered by sniping them during chargeup. Also, projectile spamming the boss quickly causes a reaction move, which has him race towards the player and hook the blade around them, requiring a trickily timed blind jump to avoid.</p>\n<p>Phase 2 causes the boss to flare up with soulfire and incorporate the blue flames into most moves: the sweep trails embers, acting like a lingering potion of fire, which can only be avoided by a well timed jump opposite to the swing's direction, and the upwards slash gains extra, flaming reach, punishing backsteps. Summoning souls simply summons more, disrupting the player longer. A sort of super move exists, a two-sided, vertical flourish setting up harmless ember walls and a spin into a sweep turns the air above the blade into the only safe zone.</p>\n<p>Worth noting is, that the Soul Reaper's scythe breaks blocks it slices through and disables shields like an axe.</p>",

The themeing of the boss and just the whole idea of a scythe as a weapon requires a design, that would instantly feel over the top in a player's hands. Not to mention, that Minecraft is primarily meant to be a sandbox, meaning boss loot needs to have worthwhile sandbox implications, like the wither's nether star beacon and the enderdragon's outer end access and all the goodies that can be found there. So instead, let's make something more utility focussed, but still soul related. A soul crystal, for example.</p>\n<p>This item would be somehow incorporated into the Soul Reaper's design and in the player's hands, it may prove surprisingly versatile. For starters, it could be a portable xp bank with an incredible capacity, allowing players to trade xp back and forth through it. That functionality would take up its right-click functions. On left click, then, it saps xp aka souls from anything it hits, one xp at a time, killing any entity with 0 xp remaining. Against players, it instead saps whole levels. Shift + left-click, meanwhile would spend a banked number of xp to send out a soul projectile, much like the one described in the other comments, which forcibly infuses souls at range, turning undead into temporary allies, passifying neutral mobs, healing passive mobs and dealing irresistable damage to players, but giving them the xp of the soul bolt.</p>\n<p>Some sculk synergy too?</p>",
