Having the cauldron over a heat source block (lava, campfire, magma block) would \"heat\" the cauldron, after that adding ingredients, could make potions, however, less power than a brewstand with a \"drawback\". For example, you have Haste for 3min you'll have Slowness afterward for 3mins, making a brew stand the \"refined\" option but allowing players to use potions in survival early on. One way to make the cauldron method appealing in later game would be that you could mix up to 3 potions worth of ingredients (Water breathing, haste, strength), but also you'd get all three drawbacks related to each. This could be trumped by potion sacks/holders/bundle upgrades that would allow potions to be stacked naturally as long as all the components are the same. Having several potions that won't give you drawbacks or one potion that will give you a boost but leave you vulnerable some way afterward makes a player strategize for sure.&nbsp;</p>",

Instead, this minor update would include multiple new potions. This is similar to how 1.20 included a minor desert update. Even though this is a minor update, there would be a lot of new potions. There should be at least ten new potions, but I want a lot of potions to be added. This update will have super creative and unique potions.

Many people playing in survival mode probably won't be able to get a single totem of undying, much less have enough to share between themselves and all their pets. </p>\n\n<p>The dog or cat could curl up inside a small bed similar to how the fox mob curls up in a little ball. \n<br />The bed could look like a 1 by 1 by 1/2  boat/slab, except the texture of the item would have a colored exterior with white in the inside, almost like a puffy dog bed in real life.  It could be crafted with white and colored wool and maybe even feathers. (And the color of the colored wool determines the outside of the bed, but the inside is always white.) </p>\n\n<p>Here are some ideas for the  crafting table grid:\n<br />Three colored wool on the bottom row of the crafting grid, with two more colored wool on the outer two spaces on the middle row. In the center of the middle row can have either a single piece of white wool or a feather. \n<br />Or you could have it be made from 2 colored wool on the outer spaces of the bottom row, with a white wool or a feather in between them.</p>\n\n<p>Having a bed for your pets makes it so that your pets can still die if you don't have a pet bed (or enough pet beds), but that it is reasonably easy to prevent a pet from fatally dying. </p>",

I feel something like that would be a little more within the range of Minecraft's capabilities when it comes to quality of life upgrades. Another idea I have is the option to feed your pets golden apples and enchanted golden apples. Right now, there's already one pet-like mob that can eat either of those and get their status effects (fox), and any mob can already get potion effects through splash potions. There's even a function for undead mobs to get the opposite of a certain status effect if splashed (potions of healing harm undeads). With all of that in mind, I feel like a function like that would be both convenient and plausible.</p>",
