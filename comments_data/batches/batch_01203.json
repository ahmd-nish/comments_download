I don't have Bedrock, but I imagine that has a different launcher anyway, so why not use Java for the Java Edition's launcher?</p>\n<p>There are probably 3rd party launchers available, but to my knowledge those don't support the MS account and I suspect there are fees and security reviews to do that (probably going to need to pay for 3rd party launchers now... they just got even more sketchy) because suddenly the login is now used across your entire computer ecosystem rather than for a harmless game with its own login.</p>\n<p>A further complaint is that the new launcher still has ads and options for all the new Minecraft-themed stuff like Dungeons, but I can't actually run those on Linux in the first place. So there is no reason for an integrated launcher. Why not skip the integration for stuff (that promptly says you can't use it) and not bother maintaining all the compile flags in the Windows launcher to bring back a \"for everyone else\" Java launcher? That was what it was for in the first place!</p>\n<p>Please, either keep maintaining some variant of the Java launcher or drop the push toward the MS account logins. I'm not going to be changing my username regardless, so why not use gamertags for if someone happens to claim mine in the future if you want to go for name reuse, and just handle usernames without a hashtag on the end (my own, since it's original) like you always have?</p>",
