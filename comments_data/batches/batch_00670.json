The ghastmallow would be good for the game as it has a lot of potential use cases. Also they add a new use for the ghast tear which is one of the least used items in the game. Most importantly I think they help alleviate the issue with the hunger system in the game at the moment, and that is almost every food is overshadowed by more efficient and effective options? Ever had a stack of pumpkin pie in your inventory? Me neither. Food with unique uses are needed and older foods (especially pork chops) need a bit of a rework.</p>\n<p>Also its not showing the pictures on my end so if that's an issue here's an album! <a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/D4FHQwM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://imgur.com/a/D4FHQwM</a></p>",

(plus a movable light source just would be really nice , it could be balanced out by how faint of light fireflies would give off kinda like a glow</p>\n\n<p>maybe it could even be a continuous faint light source even when you have darkness affect? or imagine being able to open up the bottle/jar and let the fireflies fly out , i hope the fireflies are actual entities cuz it will add alot of new possibilities!</p>",
