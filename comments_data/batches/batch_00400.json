Chainmail armor can also probably be upgraded via smithing table with sculk upgrade templates (only available in the new dimension and/or rarely found in the end) and echo shards making threaded sculk armor. Threaded sculk armor not only can bypass the same effects but eliminates the binding that regular sculk armor would give, doesn’t spread sculk and leaves player hunger intact, also allowing for quicker movement in or on slime related blocks. Its weakness is lava reverting any armor pieces &nbsp;back to chainmail when touched clearing any enchantment it’s possessed.

Make the sculk armor useful, maybe not so much in the overworld but in a new one where most wouldn’t dare to go. Maybe the warden wasn’t enough to ward you off or failed at keeping you from a terrible mistake. You are now bound to sculk and only the brave can have a heart beat as brave as the wardens. A new seal has opened a gate to a new dimension a new world completely different from what is known. Players start in a series of tunnel dwellings covered in sculk inhabited by various hostile creatures and ancient ruins. But the twist here is you start the world from the bottom dwellings and it only gets more dangerous as you trying exploring your way up to an unpromised surface with deadly radiation, fewer mobs and seeping pools of acids only suitable for those built to withstand its harsh effects(sculk armor could be resistant to acid and radiation). Sculk armor can also temporarily get rid of hunger bar since it feeds on xp essentially turning the player as barbaric as the warden in this dimension. Adding a new rare items like a totem of decay and sculk totem could slow and even stop xp drainage to allow the player to adapt to the new environment. Could be useful for mega xp farms when slaying ancient foes. Souls, echo shards and bed can be used to craft shreikers spawn points. Wardens heart can also be used to instantly remove armor and activate sculk transformation</p>",

Introducing to us the sculk remote(sends &nbsp;remote echo signals to nearby sculk sensors and can be paired to calibrated sensors remotely activating it allowing players to pulse(tap) or hold a redstone signal. Regular sculk sensors, amethyst blocks, and wool can be used to channel signals and manipulate radius for redstone and potion effect time replenishment) amethyst compass( points player towards nearest amethyst crystals and/ or calibrator), and clock block a block that can receive and display a numerical input with three switches for a stopwatch, timer, and calendar. Uses pluse mode(like the button when it releases a pulse signal when time goals are met) and standby mode(like the lever it allows for continuous signal once time goal is met)or clock mode(resets after goal is met). And maybe something that repels sculk like music cds and/or glowstone can be added. Not to limit the function of collectable cds, maybe have it add to the function of redstone different ones for different frequencies of repulsion. Or to be a little more ancient different frequencies could turn sculk into different types of typically unattainable natural blocks like sand, diorite, anisidite, deepslate, endstone, etc with rare occasions to spawn ores within sculk conversion. Stack a sculk sensor on a note block to boost its range. Use in combination with calibrated sculk sensor for unique creations and effects. I’ve previously suggested an idea to use variations of amethyst crystals to replinish potion &amp; status effects of any nearby entities. The title for that idea is “Use amethyst to replenish potion effects” for those that want deeper insight and how it could be a smoother connection to this idea here. And I do want to say now mojang these ideas are yours to share.</p>\n</blockquote>",

        "body": "<p>Lapiz, Quartz, and Resin can also have new uses that fit right in. Starting with lapis, other than enchanting it could be used heighten the water blocks surface level and purify it. Both variants can be used to do so, thus allowing for natural waves in ocean if lapis is on sea floor. Placing one lapis block underwater pushes or places the height of water source blocks above it by one vertically. Removing or breaking underwater lapis sets water level flat again. Stacking and connecting more lapis can result in higher and wider waves or spouts. Variants of quartz can be used to do the exact same thing when under lava enabling lava eruptions. Resin reacts to previously mentioned acid in the same fashion but dissolves/destroys it over time (bricked resin having the second shortest decay in time) besides the chiseled version and a new toxic version. Adding toxic resin to water just like lapis can make its state change, but into acid. Acid placed in water makes murky swamp like water thats able to be colored with dye and darkened by adding even more like a cauldron(lapis can rid water toxicity). If toxicity is gone but water is still colored, adding more buckets of water to it can revert it back to its original texture. Acid can also be placed in lava to generate nether quartz ore.</p>",
