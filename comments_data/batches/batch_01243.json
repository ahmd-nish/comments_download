However in Blockbench, there is a PC-specific plugin for an editor for the mod (cpm_plugin from tom5454 in GitHub) made by the same creator of that mod (Not Alphs), however that needs editable versions of models as having one that's usable in game usually cannot be edited. And with the editable version of the file, it gives a way to be cross-edited on Blockbench and the CPM editor (import from / export to CPM editor and Blockbench) (I tried, importing works), and that way it makes porting from a model for Java Edition mod into one for Bedrock Addon easier, but as the repository said, animations may break while cross-editing, Should Alphs import it may need to take some time re-animating characters. Also I prefer that to be uploaded to MCPEDL as it would be usually free.</p>",
