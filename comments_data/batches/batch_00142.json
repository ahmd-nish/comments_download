I definitely think that the obsidian pillars in the end should be made a lot taller, and all of the crystals should be caged, that way, when you enter the end, you need to search for end cities that have ships and find the elytra and use that to destroy the end crystals. Another thing I think they should do is make the dragon land and melee attack you instead of awkwardly flying over the portal and hitting you, this would mean that it would be able to attack you just as easily as you can attack it at what’s currently it’s most vulnerable moment. This would also incentivize you to take to the skies and chase it to shoot it with a bow or even melee attack it. You would also probably want to bring an enchanted book such as unbreaking or mending so that your elytra doesn’t break mid fight. I think that this as well as a new combat update would make for an amazing update as well as just a new experience in the game.</p>",
