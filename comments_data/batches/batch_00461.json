The problem with the ability of a charge being on the weapon already is it also ruins the point of the trident. No One will want to get a trident if a spear has one of its major functions without the required enchantment (Riptide). The Crossbow is an upgraded bow, but it shows some pros and cons to choosing the bow. If the Spear is early game, it defeats the purpose of getting a sword AND getting a bow.<br><br>So while I like your idea, but it would ruin the purpose of all the other weapons in the game.</p>",

It becomes increasingly difficult for anyone else to obtain their own, especially for players who don't yet have one. Players with elytra can hand them out, but that would seem to deprive others of the same quest the first player got to experience.</p>\n<p>If a player can craft elytras once they've obtained one from an end city, there's no longer an incentive to fly around the end dimension grabbing them up. If people just want to receive one from another player, that still works. If they want to quest for their own and obtain the recipe, that's hopefully a better experience now!</p>",
