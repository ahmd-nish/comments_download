Also, it would be interesting if the player could pick the sarcophagus and use it as a bed</p>\n\n<p>The mummies should be killable only by a specific item that is hidden somewhere inside the pyramid. If the mummy is hit by any other item/weapon it only falls on the ground for a few moments and then come to life again. When killed, they drop bandages, which could be used to introduce a new mechanics to the game, they could be used by the player to imobilize some mobs and other players for a short amount of time, but can be used only once and then break</p>\n\n<p>Some of the items looted could have a chance of being cursed in a way that the player can't perceive and after a random time inside the player's inventory it starts giving damage to the player at a rate of 1 heart each 2 seconds</p>\n\n<p>Also there could be rooms with mummy spawners</p>",

Even revisiting requires a lengthy trip to your stronghold. After you get your loot the only reason to return is either for replacements or dragons breath.

Sorry for the bluntness, but your ideas for the dimension aren't anything New, Original, or Creative.</p>\n<p>And on top of this, a New Dimension needs to be far down the line. The rest of the game needs to be fully fleshed out and complete before a New Dimension is added. At the BARE MINIMUM, it would need to wait until 1.20.</p>",
