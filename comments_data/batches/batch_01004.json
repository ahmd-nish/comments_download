(so they aren't ruining the game by being annoying)</p>\n<p>#3-make it so that a Emotes are removed from servers unless the Host says so. like Mineplex would be ruined if some guy is Dabbing right next to you&nbsp; when you are trying to hide.</p>\n<p>#4-Lastly (if you do add Emotes) try not to make them at all like \"Fortnite\" and also don't make them to cringe.</p>\n<p>I and a lot of people think these Emotes are going to ruin the game. and they probably are, but I, and probably a lot of other people think that if you follow these rules they you could help.
