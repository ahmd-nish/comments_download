Sure, new content is cool and all, but I think that we should ask ourselves before we ask to add something: Will the addition <em>expand</em> the game, or crowd it?</p>\n<p>I think that many of the new additions in the past few updates have crowded the game more than they've grown it. For instance, the stone variants, while handy as decoration, don't do anything mechanically that regular stone can't, and can't be used to craft tools.</p>\n<p>It's the same thing with copper. You can use it to make a few cool things, but otherwise, its use is pretty limited in comparison to how much inventory space it takes up. Who needs more than one spyglass? Or a hundred lightning rods? And not everyone will want to build using copper at all times. I usually just avoid mining it altogether to avoid the hassle, which kills me. I want to interact with the whole game, not cut off the parts that don't engage me. Even the newer animals, like axolotls or pandas, can run into this problem.</p>\n<p>In contrast, even though the Nether update added a bunch of new mobs and blocks, including two whole wood variants, they weren't just taking up space - They were a part of an expanded Nether gameplay experience. The game became more fun because there was more places to explore and things to do. But frankly, simply adding new stones and mobs and things without new mechanics, places to explore, or activities to pursue can sometimes make the game feel hollow, materialistic and crowded.</p>",
