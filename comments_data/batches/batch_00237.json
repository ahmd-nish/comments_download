Also changing its charged attack to the ice block attack, just combining it with the white dragon-breath particle attack (to resemble snow). Anyone in the particle effect gains frostbite, but when the user gets frostbite, they get regeneration &amp; absorption. Entities hit directly will have their animation suspended for a while, depending on how long it was charged. Attack does more damage (but caps off) and snow effect grows wider (no cap) the more it’s charged.\n<br />Fire Spell book: the higher the charge, the higher the knockback &amp; initial damage, the projectile is same size but deeper red, the explosion afterwards is what increases (can one-shot several mobs+be used for strong rocket jumping).\n<br />*Player can only equip 1 book at a time.
