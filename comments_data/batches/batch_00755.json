Dynamic lighting is where the light level of blocks continuously change as an entity moves. I'm only saying that we don't have actual dynamic lighting \"right now,\" meaning that a part of me just hopes that in the far future, most devices would be good enough to support it, because I love dynamic lighting. I'm saying that for the hopes for maybe 3+ years from now, if Minecraft is still a popular thing at that time, which I hope it is. Sorry if I had confused you.</p>",
