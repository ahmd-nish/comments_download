However, the idea of having a long-range weapon underwater is cool. That’s why tridents exist. Also, let me remind you that trindents have more attack power than diamond swords. I understand your enthusiasm, so, keep thinking to make better!</p>",

Also, since when has Minecraft been a \"realistic\" game?<br><br>Since the idea is tagged as \"needs info,\" I'll expand on it.<br><br>I feel a Prismarine Arrow would be crafted with a Feather, Stick, and Prismarine Shard. It would yield 4 arrows, like the normal arrow crafting recipe does and deals the same damage as regular arrows do. Their only difference would be they could travel underwater.<br><br>This gives Prismarine Shards a greater use and more of a reason to hunt for Guardians. And hey, you could use the shards you get from the Guardians to craft more arrows to get more shards to get more arrows. XD</p>",

It makes sense then to spin 8 carpet from one wool block which you can spin a pattern onto 8 carpet sections at a time. </p>\n\n<p>Another similar use would be to customize the blankets and pillows on beds by using a solid color bed as the default item like a plain banner, then  customizing the blanket &amp; possibly the pillow in a limited way.

Scrolls are difficult to get, though far more applicable than most potions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scrolls are used for casting spells, and each one has 50 uses, along with an experience cost. Scrolls would be made with a Scroll Table, a new crafting system. The table has four slots, one for a spell tome - determines effect, one for 1-3 amethysts - determines scroll power, one for paper - base item, one for scroll - resulting item. Spell tomes would be obtained rarely from enchanting books, or as loot in End chests. Effects would include fireballs, damaging and slowing snowballs, armor reducing, health drain, and summoning spells, like a friendly vex equivalent. Amethysts would be found on the underside of end islands, in small veins. This would make amethysts and therefore scrolls difficult to get, but the utility of scrolls would make them well worth the effort of obtaining. Inputting more amethysts would increase the power of the crafted scrolls.</span></p>",
