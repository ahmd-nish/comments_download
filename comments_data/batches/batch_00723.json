Overall the idea of having it scared of something seems weird to me, as it really doesn't fit with its potential lore. Just like they did with Ravagers fearing Rabbits; it's funny and has some potential, but it doesn't really make much sense in the bigger context of the game and its origin. And I do agree that nobody would want to risk with such a 50-50 scenario. It's also worth noting that we know the Warden wouldn't full on attack you just the moment you slip or make a single vibration. During Minecraft Live we learn that it first investigates the locations of any vibrations it senses. So it's not like it detects you once and you have to run. After all it's blind, so it can't tell what it's detecting right away before it reaches the location. They said you'll be able to use projectiles to create vibrations away from you and distract it. So a wrong movement will not be a death sentence. You'd still have a chance to distract the Warden before it finds you. I've seen too many people worried that one wrong movement will be your death; from what we've seen that is not correct. The Warden only locked down on kingbdogz when he hit it. Before that it was just walking slowly towards him to investigate the location.</p>",

I'm trying to be productive and think out loud. Honestly in general, I'm against coming up with very specific ideas about features when we know there are so many mechanics and underlying features we haven't seen yet. An idea about the Warden or Deep Dark can sound very cool in theory, but in practice it might contradict with one of their design goals or one of the other gameplay aspects of that mob or biome. With this specific idea, I'm thinking that being able to simply ward off the Warden might not be what they're going for, as they've said repeatedly they want it to be a stealth mission. That's why a boot enchantment is also not an option they're considering. I could totally be wrong, but that's how I see it. I also think another problem in general is that people are over-exaggerating the difficulty of dealing with the Warden. Its extreme strength is meant to make you try as much as you can to not provoke it, not really keep it away. And by provoke I mean having it lock down on you like it did when kingbdogz hit it. After all, it's blind. If you don't pick a fight, you won't get a fight.</p>",

Caves &amp; Cliffs already changes literally all of the fundemantals of the game, from the world generation and biome distribution systems to essential mob spawning rules. It's not just adding new tools; from what we can see it's setting the foundation for what the Minecraft world would look like in terms of world generation as a whole. It's making terrain generation independent from biome distribution, allowing terrain to form first into hills, plateaus, cliffs, overhangs, and various landscapes that biomes spread throughout and adapt to afterwards. That combined with the new cave generation and 3D biomes, is a complete game changer. Besides, three cave biomes is still quite a few, especially with how fleshed out and unique the Deep Dark, for one, is planned to be. From what we know about it, it would be one of the most unique and fleshed out experiences of any biome yet. I mean, it literally has 5 unique blocks all with gameplay functionality. They can only do so much in one update, and even though they split it for that reason they still made incredible advancements with this update to the point where it is absolutely revolutionary. It's certainly not the last cave update the game could have, so there will always be chances for more.</p>",
