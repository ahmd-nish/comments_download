I think it would be cool if there was a togglable option called “Building decay” or something where, once toggled on. Over time buildings using blocks like stone brick will become cracked and missy and cobble stone can turn to mosey cobble stone. Also some blocks can decay completely but only a very little amount, leaving some holes in old stone walls. And vines and moss should be able to grow on wood and other structures. I think this would be a really cool feature that would add another level of difficulty to the game as you’d actually have to look after your builds.</p>",
