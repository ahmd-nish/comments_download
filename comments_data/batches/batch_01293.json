Not everyone is willing to download third-party software to mod.</p>\n<p>Plus, it'd unify every mod under one loader, unlike now, where there's like 6 now, with 2 of them being mainstream major options, Forge and Fabric. Those 2 have created the biggest tear between the modding community, resulting in many mods that'd be great together to be unusable together.</p>\n<p>Create a Java API, darnit. Even if it's like Bedrocks extremely limited API right now, just let us have the skeleton, and continue to build upon it until we can create great experiences like Create within the confines of Minecraft's own engine.</p>\n<p>If there were a capable Java API, 3rd party mod loaders would be abandoned and every active modder would re-create their mod within the API.</p>\n<p>Mojang, please do this.</p>\n<p>Man, Microsoft is really holding you guys back.</p>",

That would be tricky though because when you beat a boss you need to grab its drop and do other things immediately, so maybe it could just be when entering a new dimension? For example, you could see a small cutscene of the celestials taking notice of you when you enter the nether, since that is required to go to the end.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I think it has less to do with detail and more to do with the gameplay experience itself. Adding new possible experiences and content has improved the game in many ways - the problem is how everything acts together. For example, because of the loot you can find in villages and shipwrecks, mining has become a far less valid strategy for obtaining some of the most important resources. Survival used to be harder. It used to be more rewarding to survive. Instead of removing features, Mojang should take a look at how features fit in the overall game and balance them accordingly.</p>\n<p>An example: I think villages and pillager outposts should be more rare - there are many valuable things you can obtain from villagers, but they aren't rare enough for a player to put a lot of work into building any one of them. There is no point in guarding a village from zombies and pillagers when there are so many of them around. Making villages rarer would enhance player experience with villages, not harm it.</p>",
