You almost have to look up syntaxes for every command you don’t just know because even though I use a controller (no tab) I don’t know which parameter is next or whatnot. I have a whole world of command block shenanigans but it’s hard to want to mess with that stuff anymore without having to do a ton of guesswork (more than usual). The virtual keyboard also messes up sign spacing so you now just have to guess the spacing. Like what the OP said, a toggle would be great. Whoever wanted the virtual keyboard can still have it.</p>",

There has been an upsurge in this on Android devices as Android has recently pushed its Android 10 OS updgrade and it seems that Android 10 doesn't like the way Minecraft implements OAuth. This points to \"Account Error -9\" reflecting an authentication failure due to Minecraft not being able to communicate properly with XBoxLive. This is really dumb as Minecraft, OAuth, and XBoxLive are all Microsoft products to my knowledge.</p>",
