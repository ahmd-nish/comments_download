The enderfins (Maybe could be called like voidswimmers or chorustrouts) could be a rare spawn but would spawn in small schools swimming through the void as a fish does in the ocean. Instead of using a similar mechanic to the enderman with aggression, it instead could be passive when looked at, but will try to attack the player when it is not in view. If a player attacks one in a school, they all teleport away. If you manage to get close enough, luring them with chorus fruit (as you would with a cat and a raw fish) you could scoop it up in a shulker shell, making it trust you, leave the school, and non-agressive. The now trusting enderfin would follow you kind of like an allay, but will lose trust if attacked. The enderfin would swim through the air slowly and cannot be leashed. The enderfin is also actively hunted by shulkers and will attack endermites on sight. I like the void idea, but I dont think it should allow you to cheat death, instead I think it should recover a few (3-9) items if the player dies in the void. Some other small details could be that like the enderman it takes damage in water, and cannot survive in the overworld or nether making it an end exclusive mob so it does not take purpose away from the allay. For breeding I think it could be a unique process where if you feed a trusting enderfin a random number of chorus fruits (anywhere from 8-24) It splits into 2 enderfin, but has to be retamed.</p>",
