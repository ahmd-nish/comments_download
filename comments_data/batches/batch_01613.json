It would work like that:</p>\n<p>First, you would get the Vex's attention by playing some music on a jukebox. It would slow down (as if it remembers that it was an Alley before) and wander around the jukebox, but it would still be able to hit you.</p>\n<p>Then, you would have do disarm it by blocking an attack with a shield.</p>\n<p>Once it has no weapon, you should give it a totem of undying and then it would dance and turn back into an allay (consuming the totem).</p>\n<p>I do think this is a really cool ideia because it makes the allay renewable but makes it hard, as finding one is right now, also it gives us a great lore and adds something other than breeding!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",

Give the messenger bird a book or a bundle(the message), then equip it with a lodestone compass so it flies to a specific location that players would know to look for it. It doesn't do players any good to spend an hour looking all over their base for their bird, it needs to go to the same spot every time. Using a lodestone compass means the bird will have a target to navigate to. Give birds 2 slots for a lodestone compass and the cargo. This allows the bird to travel to its destination with the first compass and then be sent to another base with another compass &amp; delivery. This would be an amazing feature for role play servers, as private communication between bases would be possible, and allow players to continue with other activities while the message is being delivered.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Birds should be able to deliver items the player has found and wants to send home immediately, so they aren't at risk of losing it. It can be only one non-armor or weapon item per bird, and the player can only carry one bird. If the player just looted the Woodland Mansion and wants to make sure a totem of undying makes it home, send it home using a carrier bird.</p>\n<p>Birds should be able to be intercepted or lured away from their destination via food by players who know where the bird will travel. This would be good for multiplayer, where players can intercept messages and items by getting close to the bird or know its flight path.</p>",

To make it more useful, rather than just a decorated chicken, perhaps it's feathers can be used to create stronger arrows, arrows that go further and inflict more damage.

Not only would that be funny to watch, it could be use to herd chickens. By placing nest with pheasants around you could create areas that effectively block chickens from passing through.</p>",

First the North American lynx, aka bobcat, it spawns mostly in rocky biomes, it can be found in mountains, and plains biomes, stone shore, savanna, and badlands. The second variant is the Canadian lynx, aka mountain lions, they are a larger variant, they spawn in cold and snowy biomes that are mostly either rocky, or icy. They can spawn in snowy extreme hills, snowy mountains, snowy taiga, and ice spikes biomes. Both variants spawn in groups of one to eight, and have a 40 percent chance of being a baby. they are neutral, but will run away if you get to close, or will become hostile if attached by the player, or if it gets too close to it's young. They kill rabbits, foxes, pigs, cows, sheep. and will not approach wolves, and neither will the wolves approach them. they can be tamed through breeding (possibly) and can be fed with any type of meat.</p>",
