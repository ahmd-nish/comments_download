Since they barely get used or made, so reminding the player these arrow variations exist may help get them used. I do suggest these have clothing similar to the snow biome ones, like a cloak of some kind? Green hood? This way the constant rain wouldn't effect it. (Skeletons are already 2 blocks high.)</p>",

Given that dried ghasts are turned into ghastlings by soaking them with a bucket of water, I would like to venture an addition to your idea. Instead of being able to tame a grumpy ghast just by taking it to the overworld, the player should also need to hydrate it. Right clicking on the ghast with a water bucket (the water would evaporate immediately upon being used on the ghast) would turn it into a mix of the grumpy and happy ghasts. The ghast would have a tired, but relieved expression, still in pain but thankful for the brief reprieve (if you want to make it really sad, using a bucket on it could have a small chance of dropping a ghast tear). As you specified in the original post, this new version of the ghast would now only target other players. It can be tempted to the player, not by snowballs but by a bucket of water. You can continue to use buckets of water on the ghast, which it will appreciate. Unlike the happy ghast, this new variation would still be immune to fire and lava damage.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>All versions of the ghast should definitely be updated to allow the player to stand on them. Whether or not it can be ridden is up for debate. Personally, yes please. However, I think an argument can be made that it would be too OP. If it is rideable it would need a different saddle texture to warn other players to not get too close</p>",
