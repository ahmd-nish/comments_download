A spider queen that would be the boss to the for mentioned cave labyrinth. A new zombie that gives you slowness when he attacks you, reasoning being he was a previous victim to the spiders and now serves there queen. I also say a rework for the spiders in general should be down because they're so clunky in the first place. Like if I had a dollar for every time I saw a spider just sitting on the ceiling not attacking me I'd actually have more than 1000 dollars. I think the should have the ability to climb on the ceiling and sides of walls to try and juke you when attacking, sort of like in deep rock galactic.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>New Blocks and Items</p>\n<p>A couple new decoration blocks like webbed dirt, wood, stone, and stone brick. Though you would only obtain them with silk touch and breaking them with anything else just gives you string. New crafting materials like spider legs, dropped from the queen, too let you create a new chest piece making you blend in more if you were to visit the another Arachnid Forrest. Also a new projectile shot from a crossbow only called a spider gland. It would drop from the spitter spider and would deal a little under what a arrow would deal but would be able to slow mobs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

We could have a lot of different Aussie animals, the iconic ones, but also a few lesser-known animals like cassowaries. Of course, we should also incorporate drop-bears. If you don’t know what they are, they are a ferocious creature native to Australia. They closely resemble koalas, but they are larger and have sharp claws and teeth. There is this new ridiculous and harmful idea that they are a hoax. As a person who has lived in Australia my whole life, I can confirm they are not a hoax. You can find more information about them on National Geographic. Anyway, they could be a rare mob that lives in eucalyptus trees and can jump on players passing by.&nbsp;</p>",

But why would players want to travel here? Well, why do they want to travel anywhere? One reason is the scenery.</p>\n<p>This biome is so awe-inspiring that any who stumble upon it when mining probably won't want to leave. The trees are giant with beautiful leaves weeping down from the branches. On the trunks of the trees you can find Foxfire Fungi - clusters of small green glowing mushrooms. The floor of the biome is made up of Alien Soil. On the floor of the forest, Ghost Mushrooms can be found. Hanging from the ceiling of the cave are glow worm threads.</p>\n<p>Another reason to go here is to gather the various items of the peculiar forest. Foxfire fungi, obtainable with silk touch, can be used in brewing to make a potion of emitting light. Ghost Mushrooms can glow pink, orange, teal, or green and are good decorations for lighting. Fissured Concrete, crafted from bioluminescence, has cracks that emit light and can serve as a good path. Silk from cocoons can be used to craft parachutes.</p>\n<p>Even without mobs, this forest sounds amazing, right? To make things better, here are some of my ideas for mobs of the forest:</p>\n<p>Crystal Fox</p>\n<p>Butterflies and Caterpillars</p>\n<p>Fireflies</p>\n<p>Jellyfish</p>\n<p>Bright Tree Villagers</p>\n<p>Tree Golem</p>",

I absolutely agree that mobs from this dimension would not spawn elsewhere.&nbsp; I would be fine if the mobs can't go through the portal.&nbsp; Although they should be able to exist in the other dimensions.</p>\n<p>5. Them attacking hostile overworld mobs sounds like a nice feature.</p>\n<p>6. If you think the magic system is overpowered, could you try to explain how, rather than just trying to keep it isolated from everything else?&nbsp; It goes from being possibly overpowered to basically worthless if it doesn't introduce new abilities to general use.</p>\n<p>7. I don't understand this at all.&nbsp; New colors on overworld trees would just be incredibly boring.</p>",

The amber used in all spell crafting acts as a battery and a magical converter.</p>\n<p>None of the other flora that is special to other dimensions is limited to the other dimensions, as long as you have the correct thing to grow it on.&nbsp; Nether Wort can be grown anywhere as long as it's on Soul Sand, and Chorus Flowers can grow anywhere as long as it's on End Stone.&nbsp; Either the soil in Mythos is special and you need to have some of that to grow the Mythos trees, or it uses normal dirt.&nbsp; Either way, it would be a new precedent for them to be unable to grow in other dimensions.&nbsp; The lack of ability to grow the new trees elsewhere would make them harder to farm for their wood and prevent them from being used as decorative accents or integral parts of builds anywhere but inside Mythos.</p>",

I wasn't really aiming for something like that. I thought by having some sort of boss in the realm would make players more interested with this idea. The big picture I would like to see happen is a realm that is more like undead. Compared to the Nether realm which basically seems like a demonic realm and the End world seems like some kind of shadow realm. The realm I would like to see is this new realm (NAME DOESN'T MATTER of Realm) to resemble the starting realm, but everything seems dead and tougher to fight. I also thought it would draw more players to included common creatures such as werewolves or vampires since they easily could fit that realm domain. The other big picture is having the boss to re-spawn over the course of a certain amount of game days. I would like to see this boss as more of a pest then actually a 5 min. battle. So I thought its main ability should be some sort of necromancy that affected the real world during the night as long as the portal to the realm stays open, as long as the boss is alive, or something else creative.</p>\n<p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
