Medium stashes <strong>may</strong> contain diamonds (maybe a few) These are supposed to be balanced. They ARE rare, and the ancient blocks cannot be moved except by the ancient piston, which is a component for a few of the variety of secret enterances. This is supposed to add many things. I would of just done this in a mod, but I''m no coder. People have been itchng for a cave update, right? The secret enterances are always exposed, along with the puzzle or hidden activator (button, levers, etc.) This secret enterance is often in a cave. Not many of the secret stashes are found above ground.</p>\n<p><em>Also, all stashes can contain lethal traps. Mojang can decide how these traps work, and what they are (and whether to add new ones) if this makes it to popularity (chances are it won't) Smaller the stash, less lethal traps. <strong>Small stashes contain</strong></em><em>&nbsp;1-3 lethal traps, and 3-5 non-lethal traps. <strong>Medium stashes contain</strong> 3-6 lethals and 4-7 non- lethals.<strong> Large stashes contain</strong> from 7 up to 10 lethal traps, and 10-15 non-lethal traps.</em></p>\n<p><em>Beware that non-lethal traps could be lethal, if you're on very low HP. These are designed to take a few points of HP if they hit you. Examples would be a 5 second poison I arrow/potion trap. A \"deadlier\" non-lethal would be a harming I arrow trap. Lethals will kill you unless you have a special type of thing on you</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>I did also just realise it may be hard to disable all the traps, so maybe just create a \"back door\"?&nbsp;</strong></p>",

There we three kingdoms long ago... Each made stashes. The largest and wealthiest of these kingdoms was called Kalles-Kia, the smallest one with not as much wealth is called Jayes-Jia and the kingdom in the middle of the two was called Quesi-Qia. Kalles-Kia was foolish and made very few stashes, each stash containing a hefty chunk of their riches. In the end, they didn't have many riches left, and they had made their puzzles using a Jazzly, an incredibly smart being who could make REALLY good puzzles. Such creatures don't exist anymore. Many of their kingdom lost their lives trying to figure the puzzles. Continued in the next comment!</p>",

The smallest kingdom, Jayes-Jia, had lots of stashes, not exactly the best guarded and concealed, but it meant people won't die as often. Each kingdom put banners in their stashes, to tell each other which is which. You can find two in each room with traps in it, and one in the treasure room. Jayes-Jia has lime banners, with the black face of a creeper on it. Quesi-Qia has a black banner, with a white cross through it. Kalles-Kia has a half-half banner. The top half is red, and the bottom half is yellow. The clans have all died out by now, first Kalles-Kia, followed by Jayes-Jia, then Quesi-Qia. It's safe to collet their treasures...
