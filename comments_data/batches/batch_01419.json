I like the idea of it spiraling to the ground when you defeat it, and I think it would be cool if it was screaming and spewing xp the whole way down. And the moon feather... what if when you held it, you could jump boost into the air really big? I'm thinking like a rocket with an elytra, but you get to use a feather to have an easy take-off. Just a thought. It should provide some kind of epic elytra upgrade/boost/thing though.</p>",

I love building horse ranches in the game, but it really sucks to have to breed to get good jumpers or fast runners. I think training would work something like this:</p>\n\n<p>*Jumping*\n<br />-Everytime you jump the horse they get better and can jump higher. \n<br />-They become easier to turn if you ride them more, and turn them a lot.</p>\n\n<p>*Racing*\n<br />-The horses get faster the more you ride them. Maybe every 15 mins or so, you get a notification that \"horse\" or whatever the name is \"has leveled up\" (or maybe not if that would be too annoying)</p>\n\n<p>*if you don't ride your horse for a while, then the stats start to wear off*\n<br />Also, along with this, horses should only be able to run for so long before getting \"tired\" and going super slow. They will only recover if fed and they go for 10 minutes without riding. This would help players have more of a challenge when moving from place to place, and to think for their animals and themselves.</p>",

It's too slow to protect the villagers. The dash attack would definitely alleviate this problem a little by giving it small bursts of speed.</p>\n<p>Another solution is to give them an ability that causes mobs in a certain radius to target the iron golem rather than any nearby villagers. A \"Taunt\" if you will. This works double for protecting villagers and helping the iron golem deal with the raiders by attracting them to him rather than having to get to them himself. Perhaps being immune to knockback and/or being more resistant to arrows would help against the crossbow-wielding illagers, or that could just be their advantage.</p>",
