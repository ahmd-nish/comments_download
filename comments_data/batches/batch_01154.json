Impaling does A LOT of damage, but to so little mobs that it isn't worth it. Making it work with any mob but with a specific condition would make it worth it to do more damage than the axe and faster with some strategy or during rain and in underwater fights. Also maybe add more levels to channeling so in level 1 works like it does now, at level 2 it works during rain too and MAYBE a third level that makes it work at any time (but that could be too op)</p>",

Unless the \"Durability\" enchant gave more than the vanilla \"Unbreaking\" causing carrying extra sets of \"Durability\" armour to be better than \"Unbreaking\" /w mending that could instead be used against less geared players and mobs to save resources. That armour would still need to be equiped when someone geared comes not to mention repaired after it goes to 0 and that needs the rework of anvil levels going up untill its not fixable anymore (idk if i had to think of anything it could be some reforging to make them go down)</p>",

This keeps the system consistent with existing consumables, prevents inventory clutter, and encourages players to carry a variety of different scrolls rather than large stacks of a single one.&nbsp;<br><br>II. One optional extension to this system could be overcasting: if a player uses scrolls beyond the daily cap, they could take cumulative damage with each scroll used. This would make pushing past the limit a meaningful risk/reward choice without adding new UI or complexity, instead communicated through a \"debuff\". The base system works perfectly fine without this, but it could offer exciting tension for players who want to take risks.<br><br>III. Librarian villagers could potentially sell basic scrolls at higher levels, similar to enchanted books. This would give villages a small but natural role in the magic system without making scrolls too accessible early in the game.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I think just making magic/enchant resistant or something similar would be cool. Like someone trying to use breach or sharpness but the enchant is less effecttive cuz of your armor or witches and skeletons trying to give you poison or something and having less duration or effect level. Would be cool if also worked with tools and weapons (like the golden sword ignoring a bit of protection or thorns for example or draining more the durability by making unbreaking less effective, etc).</p>",
