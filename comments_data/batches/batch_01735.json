(My post got deleted, but if You need some ideas:\n<br />Skulk Sensors can be Trained to only hear a specific thing\n<br />If you feed a skulk sensor with the drop of the Warden (f.e. The dark heart, valuable), it will listen to its environment until it hears something. This sound event will be memorized. From now on it will only hear that specific sound. The other sounds will get filtered out. Besides, the visual appearance changes as it uses the \"filter-mode\". If you break it with a netherite pickaxe, it resets to the normal mode and gets dropped together with the dark heart. You can feed the skulk sensor only with one dark heart.</p>\n\n<p>This would create a whole variety of new useful mechanics. Since Minecraft never had a feature like this, it would fit in quite well.

If the comparator doesn't count the eliminators, either its output power level would be restricted to less than 15 or the correspondence between inventory item counts and output level would become variable, which means you'd have to calculate it separately for each case where eliminators were used. Either option would be viable, but would require a custom-designed circuit configuration for every use case involving eliminators, and the circuit could fail if the number of eliminators ever changes. It's not undoable, but kind of complicated in a way that's inconsistent with the rest of redstone. I definitely don't see it making it easier to use comparators.</p>",
