You'll also be able to open a menu to select which soul you'd like to use and how much durability it has left.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Staffs will be able to be broken but I don't know how the reason I'd like to have this is so the souls that weren't used that were in the staff can take their revenge on you.</p>",

First it should be 2x2, and you </span><strong>shouldn't</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&nbsp;get the blocks mined. It would also mine very quickly. This would be great because things like strip mining are so boring and slow, and doesn't bring any fun to the game. So this hammer idea would really help, especially if you don't need all the blocks you're mining (usually stone) and prevents an inevitable full inventory issue. Plus, it brings strategy to mining. You have a choice to either mine and get all the blocks when tunneling very slowly and inefficiently, or you use a hammer that mines efficiently, but you don't get the drops, and you can then use your pickaxe on the actual ores. It shouldn't even count against the \"1 block at a time\" rule because with this hammer idea, you aren't mining the blocks... you're destroying them. It's kind of like a more controlled version of a TNT tactic.</span></p>",

I got this idea similar to 1 that Cam@MinecraftAbormals had for alternatives for vein mining, which was an enchantment that broke blocks faster if it was the same type of block as you previously had broken. Really cool idea. That way, it's still 1 block at a time.</p>",

Think about shelves as like a storage item like chests and enderchests... I mean they are still furniture.

So, Scaffolding has a chain/tree-like stucture - chain is for chaining, and tree because branches. And when, for example, the scaffolding, that has \"down\" source direction, has the block below it removed, it breaks and causes any scaffolding attached to it to also break - and so on, until the entire \"branch\" collapses.</p>\n<p>This removes the need in the \"distance\" blockstate, replacing it with \"origin\" one which has only 6 values (\"up\" is also a thing - see original suggestion, the part where it talks about the ability to extend Scaffolding downwards), and in the Scaffolding being affected by gravity, while making it actually useful in building - current implementation makes dirt simply more viable.</p>",

I'm assuming either taking it from it's hands (which is cruel) or killing the baby (which is even cruel-er [if that's a word]) I also found it very offensive to ClayGoddess and Macchu when you said \"multiple possibilities that you clearly can't visualize\" I found it as you said that they don't have imagination. And to obtain the item, if it was used as a weapon, you would have to kill the baby. And to get another one, if you killed the baby with the toy, I think that would be super cruel. Adding this would just add a whole new level of cruelty to the game.</p>\n<p>Many Minecraft players would find this item useless.

Milk would still be useful for&nbsp;things like withered, slowness or blindness and its not like tropical fish are common so milk would still be good to use sometimes. Another idea is that mojang could add more food items that require milk to craft, like how cakes use milk in their crafting recipe.</p>\n<p>Milk could even be used by milking a cow, waiting a few days so it can go off and then using the sour milk for things like making crops grow faster (It would be like bonemeal only weaker and easier to get).</p>\n<p>There are many other uses for milk that could be added.</p>",

If you attack a hostile mob while this potions effect is active all mobs that should ignore you in a 15 block radius or so get hostile again. Illagers shouldn't be affected by the potion because they are intelligent, creepers should also not be affected by the potion they should just stop chasing you while this potion is active but they sould still be able to explode if you get too close to them. Also endermen shouldn't be affected because you still have to look them in the eyes to make the hostile.<br>There could be more tiers of the potion. for example the first one which lets lesser mobs ignore you (All the Overworld stuff) and the second tier that would affect the mobs in the nether. I'm not quite sure how the recipe for the tier II potion should be but it should be an item that is a bit harder to get.<br><br>I guess you guys get the idea of this potion tell me how you think about it<br>And lastly I have to apology if some sentences don't make any sense my english isn't perfect :D<br>Have a nice day<br>-Smijo</p>",
