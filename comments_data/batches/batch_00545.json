However this must be an end game feature as it is found in the end, so it will need to be better than netherite in some way.<br>I like the dragonmail idea, but I think it should be dropped by the Ender dragon. The Ender dragon will drop 1 scale, every time it dies after respawning it. This will make the respawning mechanic much more used and valued. The armour should be fire resistant, as the Ender dragon is immune to fire, and should also teleport back to the player if it falls or is dropped into the void.</p>\n<p>As for the tools, they should be faster than netherite and don’t burn or die in the void.</p>\n<p>As for the sword, it can be upgraded to a new sword with a completely fresh sprite. This can have another name, like The Dragons Blade, or Bane Of The Dragon. The sword, when held in the players hand will give an aura of dragons breath around the player, damaging all end mobs (Endermen, endermite and shulkers). This sword will also have a chance when it attacks a mob to inflict it with a new potion effect, gravity. This will pull mobs from a certain radius maybe 4 or 5 blocks in towards the mob that was hit for a short duration of time, maybe 3 seconds, excluding neutral mobs and creepers, of course. This would be a great mechanic and add more reward to the end game.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I agree, mending is far too good for how easy and early you can get it.</p>\n<p>I think its important that we acknowledge that we don't need tools to be unbreakable. The most expensive tool is 3 diamonds and that can be gotten with literally one diamond ore mined with a fortune 3 pickaxe. Villagers make enchanting easier than mining cobble so there is no real challenge to making new enchanted tools when one breaks.</p>\n<p>About mending having levels suggestion. I think levels don't fix the issue, I believe we need to change how a player obtains mending completely. Also even if it has an extremely low chance of being traded the chance is still there so the player can still just break and place the lectern until they get Mending III.</p>\n<p>Someone suggested putting them exclusively in the end as loot. I think this is a decent idea since it makes it true end game loot and requires players to defeat the end dragon before they get such a overpowered enchant. Though this idea doesn't solve the issue of everything having mending at the post-endgame.</p>\n<p>My idea would be to make a boss drop it. That way players have to defeat the boss for every piece of gear they want mending on. This still lets players who really want mending to get it on everything but others might choose to live without it since making new equipment is easy enough.</p>\n<p>I think if we implement either of the ideas the issue of mending being obtained too early would be solved but other issues would still exist.
