Therefore I'm removing the part about armour bypassing protection enchantment limits - its too unrealistic.<br><br>Also your suggestion about gold is very interesting. I actually considered adding a suggestion like this but for gold, and then they added copper - which made me want to make the suggestion around it instead. This, and the fact that gold already has a side usage with piglins in the nether.&nbsp;<br><br>I honestly think the theme fits better with gold though (high enchantability, conductive, literally GOLD - associated with magic and power). It also encourages early game travelling, as gold enchanted items can easily be found in ruined portals, providing an early start to late-game gear. Also, since gold has a low durability, it enforces the idea that the material is a specialised tool with many weaknesses despite it out-performing endgame stuff, making it less likely to overshadow netherite and diamond. ADDITIONALLY, because gold is so easy to enchant, it encourages players to experiment and engage with the enchantment system.<br><br>I'm so torn because this suggestion actually works with gold better than copper, yet I don't want copper tools to fade into obscurity.<br><br><br><br></p>",
