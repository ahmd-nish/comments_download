While also give the pillagers a village/base like structures because an OUTPOST is a force separated from the MAIN FORCE to protect FROM SURPRISES. Will it make sense if the pillagers and villagers at war with each other and villagers should have OUTPOSTS and BASES too? Also PILLAGERS should also be attacked/raided because if they can't be raided/attack, what is the purpose of the OUTPOSTS, aesthetic purposes only? What? And also CAN YOU ADD at least a creature to the sea where players can get in trouble (and it only spawns in deep waters) and can you add blocks that can be made into ships (like Archimedes mod) and VILLAGES THAT HAS DOCKS/OR PARKING AREA FOR SHIPS(I don't know the term) to give sense why some ships where recked, and so that we can create functional ships through blocks!
