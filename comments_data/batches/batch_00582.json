So, you pull out your torch launcher, and throw a light source deep into the middle of the area. Suddenly, you can see all the monsters that would have killed you if you had stepped in blindly! Now, with the ability to see, you can fight the monsters and light up the rest of the area the normal way.</p>\n<p>The torch launcher would not cause damage, and it probably shouldn't be like a catapult, because mojang says they don't want catapults I think. What if it was like an atlatl, a device with durability that lets you throw the item in your offhand really far? If it doesn't have a specific use, it would just drop the item, but if it was, say, a torch, it would land and light up the area, or if it was an ender pearl, it would teleport you, or an arrow would cause damage. It would just launch items, not as far as a bow or crossbow, but farther than dropping them out of your inventory. It would be great to throw things!</p>",

I will say that this is a interesting idea, I am not trying to be rude. I just don't see this in Minecraft. A Portable furnace is not very Mincerafty.
