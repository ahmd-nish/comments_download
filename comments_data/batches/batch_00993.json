It can even be argued that leather armor is currently more difficult to acquire than iron armor. The way it would balance this would be that it would slow down players from getting iron before they have a good food source set up, which is an important milestone in early gameplay. In other words, iron (and other) armor would be impractical until the player has enough food to sustain it.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Also, perhaps there could be a list of armor by weight from lightest to heaviest. (Heavier=hunger lost faster). My list from my post went:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leather</li>\n<li>Turtle Shell</li>\n<li>Chain</li>\n<li>Diamond</li>\n<li>Iron</li>\n<li>Gold</li>\n<li>Netherite</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sorry if my grammar isn't good atm, I am a little busy now.
