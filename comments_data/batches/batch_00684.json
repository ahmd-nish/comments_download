To which I say: Its not necessary to make things indestructible, just more durable. What's the point of being able to design complex labyrinth/dungeon if it can just be mined through in a fraction of the time it would take to solve? Pregen structures could even benefit from this.<br><strong>What:&nbsp;</strong>While some suggest modifying blocks in inventory with tables, this just seems like it would result in a lot of unnecessary \"new blocks\" cluttering up inventories and the creative menu. It would also make construction more difficult when you accidentally misplace a block. Instead, why not make the \"reinforcements\" a consumable item that you apply to an already existing block.<br><strong>How:&nbsp;</strong>How is a bit more complex. Ideally you could apply the reinforcement to each individual block face, but that could be more difficult to implement. Having the upgrade behave like vines could be the easiest method, but that would prevent you from placing anything in the space the \"reinforcement\" occupies. Entities would get around this, but those already result in performance issues as it is. It could be applied to the block as a tag, but 6 tags may end up being too tedious, which leaves us it one tag applied to the whole block, this tag would clear on block breaking to keep it clean.</p>",
