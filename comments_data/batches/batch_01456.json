They could be bred during the day, or in bright areas. Spiders that you breed should probably become passive over a span of three (in-game) days. All offspring should be fully passive and tamable, and once grown, rideable. [Initial Idea]</p>\n<p>However, tamed spiders may become more useful than tamed horses. Spiders can climb walls, attack enemies, and spawn in with passive potion effects, allowing for selective breeding for far better enhanced spiders. These all culminate into reasons horses and possibly dogs may become obsolete. Spiders are extremely common, and easily farmable. Taming spiders may make two mobs redundant, and make an extremely overpowered passive mob. [Cons]</p>\n<p>So, this means the spiders riding/loyalty may need to be gimmicky. Maybe during the night (or reverse) they attack or kick you off, and maybe require meat to keep them passive. Perhaps you need something to remind you that they are still a hostile mob, even if leashed. Just trying to brain storm the idea, and possible flaws. [Possible Fixes]</p>",

(They just randomly swim around you waiting to get an opportunity to latch on.)</p>\n<p>- after <em>X</em> ticks they drain 1/2 heart and drop off.</p>\n<p>- X would depend on armor at that location.</p>\n<p>- If you have a potion effect, it ends when you take leech damage.</p>\n<p>- they all drop off whenever you take non-leech damage.</p>\n<p>- dropped leeches will become fat (like silverfish) and half speed. They will drop to the bottom of the water block and rest for X ticks until they become skinny again and ready to feed... perhaps this is a breeding cycle and that leech splits onto an adjacent source block when it becomes skinny.</p>\n<p>- they don't do well out of water and will just take damage/die when they drop off in air.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

Moreover, once tamed, it will attack any mob that either attacks or is attacked by the player, using some sort of charging move, causing some serious knock back and wither effect to the mob (note that it has a cooldown). It does this either while the player is off the horse or when the player is moving towards the target mob.</p>\n<p><strong>Acquiring A Wither Skeleton Horse</strong></p>\n<p>While exploring the Soul sand valley biome, a lone wither skeleton horse can be spotted, this is the wither skeleton horse trap (note that unlike the ones in the overworld, this one does not require any natural event to spawn, it is just a very rare spawn). Once the player gets near the horse, it will charge at the player till the player is hit, causing the player to be knocked back. This first charge will cause an explosion, in which its rider will spawn along with 2 normal skeleton horses with normal skeletons riding them. The rider of the wither skeleton horse will be a wither skeleton, holding a netherite sword. The wither skeleton horse will also charge at the player at this phase. To tame it, the player must defeat the riders.</p>",

The amount of protection (plus the previous increase to wolf HP) feels effective and well-balanced, and I wouldn't want the protection to be any higher.</p>\n<p>Communicating the armour's durability is very effective, by emitting particles when taking significant damage and through visual texture changes. However, the inconsistent durability threshold for each damage stage is less intuitive (the texture changes after the first 4 durability points, then the next 16, then the next 24, then breaking after the last 20). I like that the pristine state displays even if the durability is not quite full - this is convenient - but after that, a more even split (4, then 20, 20 and 20) would be more intuitive. Alternatively, there could be one less state, with the final change later on (such as changing at 4, then 30 (or 40), and breaking after 30 (or 20) more) to make it more obvious when the armour needs urgent repair.</p>\n<p>Some of the player concerns about improving wolf survivability are not related to their personal defense, though - wolves can still put themselves in lethal danger (usually to natural hazards like lava or long falls) due to issues with their pathfinding algorithms, so I hope to see pet pathfinding improvements in future :)</p>",

Wolf armor is finally useful against creepers, lava, fall damage etc. It's great that we can now dye it, I'm glad mojang listens to the community.</p>\n\n<p>Having said that, the low durability heal of each scute is bad, constantly repairing the armor makes adventure with wolves annoying. One scute needs to heal at least half durability. Better yet, when durability is completely gone, it should still be usable as a \"broken wolf armor\", giving some defense for the wolves instead, just like before. This way, players don't have to always carry stacks of scutes. Ideally it needs a regen enchant.</p>\n\n<p>On multiplayer, wolves should reset their attack AI via sitting, because if you accidentally hit a friend, the wolf will permanently target them until it dies. For PvP, wolf armor is balanced &amp; not OP, as you can bypass them with thorns, harming pots, shears.</p>\n\n<p>I also love the Bogged as it makes swamps &amp; some caves unique! The SE can be slimier &amp; different from skeletons. I like it can be sheared, but obscure mechanics need achievements to hint at players (Also, husks should really drop renewable sands). Future hostile mobs should not be reskins, we need uniques like fishes, arthropods.</p>\n\n<p>The lesser Bogged HP/firerate makes it manageable on easy/normal mode, which is nice for casual players, but I hope the poison's more challenging on hard mode.</p>\n\n<p>I like how hardcore's coming to bedrock! I hope I can convert my current world to hardcore &amp; I wish multiplayer hardcore's possible.</p>",

Interactions such as clicking a horse with a saddle or armor, equipping those items is incredibly fun. But the interaction for repairing dog armor is rough. The sit hitbox is much smaller, and hard to interact with. I would have a UI window open when you click the wolves head. Have a slot for armor for the wolf, and allow for repairs to be done using the anvil workstation.<br><br>Why are there so many darn armadillo scutes? No cooldown of sweeping them off. Right click the all powerful wolf armor and tada never fear your dog is immortal.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><br>The Wolf Ai Problem:</strong><br>Essentially the main problem with the wolf is its AI. While I would be okay without a UI to apply armor like the horse, its a shame that the actual pet AI with the wolf is so lackluster.

Dragons are especially popular and they fit on end dimension, and I agree it can be interesting and fun if there's both pet armor and mount armor.</p>",

I hope some of them can be more like huskies/retrievers, deviating slightly more from normal-wolf look.</p>\n\n<p>Even though I voted the unique-looking crab as the reach accessory is useful for combat and exploration, I have NO regrets that armadillo wins now. Some of the most highly-requested wolf features are here because of armadillo, these are decades-old suggestions. Plus, the wolf armor is at least usable now, repairs just need to be easier &amp; more convenient so bringing wolves is NOT detrimental. Armadillo definitely feels like the right choice, and mob votes should feel this way, instead of disappointing squid reskins.</p>\n\n<p>1.21 is looking good as it caters to combat players, explorers, redstoners, pet lovers, builders etc. Many Youtubers enjoy having these pet features in Minecraft, as well as chambers adding gameplay content. I think the few flaws left is the chambers; Breeze charges are items you need tons of, for parkour content &amp; jumping mountains etc, but atm it needs to be farmed slowly, making it very useless. It needs to be craftable into a reusable weapon instead, it'll really satisfy combat and exploration players! Often, mojang additions are unfortunately made less fun/viable for the sake of simplicity/consistency, such as copper bulb ticks which could revolutionize redstone, but it's now gone. Content should ideally generate some hype to entice new &amp; old players to come back.</p>",

Minecraft can be very lonely sometimes and without mobs to interact to, it will get boring. (Though sometimes you actually want the lonely scary vibe in certain areas, which is why backrooms mods in MC are so popular)</p>\n\n<p>Still, traveling companions add so much incentive to play minecraft. It definitely would be nice if we can upgrade our companions, because back then the most convenient and effective way to use wolves was to not heal them and keep breeding. They felt like disposable soldiers. But with wolf armor enchants using valuable books, each wolf will feel more valuable and it'll encourage players to build a connection with them.</p>\n\n<p>This is looking to be a decent update. I can imagine the trailer for 1.21, Steve and Alex exploring trial chambers with their wolf companions, then fighting the big bad of the dungeons, it's gonna be exciting like those \"bees fight\" fanmade MC animations! I don't mind if this update takes a while longer, I just hope it's truly fleshed out to something amazing.</p>\n\n<p>As a side suggestion, it may be better to put all 1.21 topics into the \"minecraft update 1.21\" category, instead of separating topics to \"mobs\" category like this.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I am very glad that the team finally decided to give our beloved Canine Companion the care they deserved after all these years. And so far personally I do think that protection and customizability do play a huge role in making our companion better and safer. However, I would like to add some simple but crucial changes to the wolf logic which does have a huge impact on their reliablity, as I have been studying them for some time already.<br>1. Their Leap-to-Attack Logic: As the current implementation, the wolf occasionally leaps at the target when they reach a certain distance closer to the target. However, this logic doesn't check whether the target is in a dangerous area or not, causing wolves to very often, follow their target down hazardous areas (e.g. lava). This can be improved by reducing the jump distance and adding additional checks if the target is in hazard.<br>2. Their max-distance fall tolerate: As per the current implementation when the target runs and falls down from a high platform, the wolf keeps on pursuing the target and path to the open spot, falling to its own death. This can be improved by forcing the wolf's pathfinder to not tolerate path points that are more than 3-4 blocks lower the previous path points and forcefully making the wolf discard the target if the target falls more than 4 - 5 blocks.<br>3. The wolf should discard the target and teleport back to the owner while it is fighting when it is more than a certain distance away from the owner.</p>",

They attack wheat only at it's first and last stages of growth (eating the seeds/ripe grain) when they attack it at it's final stage of growth, it reverts back to it's previous stage of growth.</p>\n<p>2. They also attack any seeds (only first growth stage)</p>\n<p>3. They are scared of Jack o lanterns and snow golems that have jack o lanterns on their heads.</p>\n<p>4. They may also attack parrots &amp; any other small birds that are added (ie.pidgeons) if there is no grain to eat... as well as bees. They always attack silverfish.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>5. they spawn at night and are neutral towards the player.</p>\n<p>6.&nbsp; If fed regularly, (bread, seeds, or meat, they share bread/meat with other crows) they and their flock and their children will be \"tamed\" and will follow the player around, not eat their wheat or hunt nearby birds (because they are well fed)</p>\n<p>7. If you hurt them or if they see you hurt another crow (unprovoked), they, their flock, their children and any crows they come across will lose their \"tamed\" status... and if they don't have the tamed status, become hostile to you... &amp; alert other mobs to your presence... meaning zombies will spawn more reinforcements. (also, crows DO NOT forget... they pass on intergenerational trauma... much like humans)</p>\n<p>8. They occasionally pick up items (especially shiny ones)</p>\n<p>9. you can bring your trust level back up by being around crows &amp; not hurting them.</p>\n<p>10. They occasionally interact with blocks (like looking into pots, picking at wheat blocks/grass, etc.)</p>",
