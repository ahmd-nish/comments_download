Ceilings / floors / bridges E.T.C. these could add to almost any build.</p>",

        "body": "<p>My original take on the quiver was too similar to what's here, so it got deleted, and I was told to move it to the similar post. I'm also gonna go over my problems&nbsp;with the original suggestions at the beginning of them. No offense upon original posters idea meant.</p>\n<p>My big problem is the misuse of this item's potential. It shouldn't just be used to store arrows, it should be used to make bow combat more viable. I'll go over that later.</p>\n<p>Heres my take:</p>\n<p>Description:&nbsp;The quiver is worn in the chestplate slot, and makes for using the bow easier.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type: Combat</li>\n<li>Renewable: Yes</li>\n<li>Stackable: No</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Obtaining:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Natural Generation: The quiver has half the likelihood of being found in a chest in a dungeon as saddles do.</li>\n<li>Fishing: Half the chance of finding one as you do as a saddle.</li>\n<li>Trading: Can be bought by a fletcher.</li>\n<li>Crafting: I noticed the fletching table is being added, so there may be potential there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Storage - Quivers are only able to hold 4 stacks of any kind of arrow. When the item is equiped, 4 extra arrows marked slots appear (I&nbsp;don't care where). When the quiver is removed, the arrows are dropped into any available spaces in the inventory, or if there are none, onto the ground.</li>\n<li>Drawing arrows - The priority for arrows are as follows: Offhand first, then the quiver, then the rest of the inventory. All arrows fired from the quivers are pulled back 25% faster than normal, and the crouching speed is not applied until a shot is 50% charged. This effect only applies to bows, and not crossbows. (It does not make sense to be able to pull a crossbow back faster, plus, crossbows already have a speed enchant.) If any other item (see my longbow post) was added that used arrows and shot them by pulling back and firing, then this would apply to those as well. This effect of the quick drawback of arrows does NOT work on infinity bows, making mending more viable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>In-Game Application</strong></em>: Using the quiver to store arrows would be useless in a game that already has you able to hold half a continent. It should be made to make shooting the arrows faster. To get balance out of the way, it uses the chestplate slot to activate, which is the most valuable armor slot. This also opens paths to a new kind of playstyle.</p>\n<p>People who use the quiver are trying to be more effective at long range, keeping out of a melee conflict where they would be at odds in, and instead choosing to kill from a distance. There could also be a small indicator above your armor value, or somewhere else that indicates how many arrows you have, and using a stack of arrows with your hand could automatically place them in the quiver for you, like putting on armor.</p>\n<p>This item will also reward skill, as it means you have to keep an eye on your ammo count, in return for being more deadly.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thank you for considering my suggestion. More to come.</p>\n<p>To the original poster, I apologize for hijacking your own post, but&nbsp;I wasn't given any choice.</p>",

It was deleted due to me not realizing most of them were already mentioned.</p>\n<p>A quiver should be implemented to make a bow easier to use, not to just use it as another chest. In my opinion, the quiver should be mainly for tipped arrows since they are not affected by infinity enchantments and there's more than 10 different types to collect.</p>\n<p><strong>Layout/Mechanics</strong></p>\n<p>The quiver should have no less than 3 slots and no more than 9. Shulker boxes are indeed useful for arrow storing, however, you have to place them in order to open it. The quiver could be opened just by pressing G or V or any other key to pull up its 'hotbar' no matter where it sits in your inventory. Like in the original hotbar, you can press 1-9 to select a stack of arrows relatively quickly and then just shoot. Above each slot will show its number and the potion effect symbol for each tipped arrow in it.</p>\n<p><strong>Shulker Boxes and Quivers</strong></p>\n<p>Basically a player could click G or V, select an arrow, shoot. The arrow would stay selected until it is changed by the player. Perhaps a quiver's abilities could be combined with a shulker box to still allow arrows, but also any other items you have. Pressing G would show just the slots in the shulker box with arrows in them. A quiver should be a mid-late game item but not the ultimate goal for arrow storage/bow usage.</p>\n<p>To the original poster, you're idea is great and would make PvP and PvE very interesting. The quiver should be more than just a ridiculous amount of storage for just one type of item.</p>",

The slots show up on screen off to the side when put in the chest plate slot or the offhand. This gives the player a choice between losing the shield or the losing the chestplate. The four slots would appear next to the hotbar and would display whatever items are there. You would be able to select different types of Arrows by shifting and pressing the number keys 1-4. Once a slot is emptied, the quiver will automatically choose a new slot of Arrows. If the quiver is emptied, you will pick up Arrows from your offhand. If your offhand is empty, it will pick randomly from your hotbar. If your hotbar doesn't contain any Arrows, it will finally begin to randomly choose from the inventory. The quiver would also be able to store fireworks (for the crossbow) and will speed up the time it takes to reload both the bow and crossbow. Not as much as the quick draw enchantment, but a substantial amount nonetheless. This would support a faster run and gun as well as more specialized strategy for those who are willing to forgo some protection.The quiver would be craftable by putting wool in a bucket shape with an iron ingot in the middle. The quiver would also be an infrequent drop by the pillager and the skeleton.\n<br />Enchantment: \n<br />Spacious 1,2&amp;3: it will add one, two, and three extra slots to the quiver's inventory respectively.</p>",

The idea of having in the chestplat slot was the first thing I thought of while reading this post and I certainly think it should only work when there. In addition, I don't think that the quiver should have the amount of space as a chest. FjallexBoi said that it should have 3 slots with 8 arrows each. I agree 3 slots sounds good but though it's not a realistic, I think each slot should fit 16. Also, I like the skin for the quiver shown in raity41's post. Possible it could look empty (not show arrows in the quiver) when no arrows are equipt (like shown in Joaqui's post. This really would be a good addition to Minecraft!</p>",

The quiver allows you to organize which types of arrows are used up first depending on the queue. So the first one in the slot is used before the next. This makes the Infinity enchantment a whole lot more worthwhile since it's only able to use a single regular arrow. You can just place 1 type of arrow in each slot in the quiver and it just cycles through the slots.&nbsp;</p>",

        "body": "<p>Look, my original take on the spear and additions I made to the trident were too similar to what's here, so it got deleted, and I was told to move it to the similar post. Because I found several posts, I'm also gonna go over my problems with each of the original suggestions at the beginning of them.</p>\n<p>First of all, this one: It ruins Mojangs&nbsp;groove to make weapons out of other weapons. I could almost hear them struggling to find a good crafting recipe for it. The tripwire&nbsp;hook trick was a genius idea though. Great job, Mojang.</p>\n<p>But a sword on top of a bunch of sticks... Yeah, no offense, but that's kind of dumb. Mojang has a realistic streak and tying a bunch of sticks to the hilt of a sword is not how you&nbsp;<strong>actually</strong> make a spear.</p>\n<p>Heres my take:</p>\n<p>Description: The&nbsp;spear can be used as both a ranged and melee weapon.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type: Combat</li>\n<li>Durability:&nbsp;125</li>\n<li>Renewable: Yes</li>\n<li>Stackable: No</li>\n<li>Sounds:&nbsp;Shoot (Twang is louder and longer.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Obtaining:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crafting: The spear is made from 2 sticks topped with flint. It has lowered durability due to the cheap materials it is made from. It can also be crafted by combining two broken spears to combine their durability.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Melee - There are technically&nbsp;two ways to hit people with the spear.\n<ul>\n<li>Standard - Whacking someone with a spear in the same way you would a sword would only deal 4 damage, and take double durability.</li>\n<li>Charging - When running, the spear would be held in both hands, level with the target, and if you hit someone with it in this state, it is thrust forward and deals a high critical hit, about 8 or more damage. Critical hits are not rewarded for jump attacks. Jumping while sprinting actually negates the charging effect. If a player is sprinting, then suddenly switches to throw instead of melee, 5% more time is added to the pullback.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Ranged - By using, the spear is pulled back, and when it is released, thrown far. Look, it's all the same deal as the trident, ok? It can even be thrown into the water and keep going, making it viable in as well as out of land.</li>\n<li>Dusting and tracking - The trident can be crafted with one glowstone dust to cast the spectral effect upon it. The first time it hits someone, they will be dealt with a very brief spectral effect, and the spear will go back to normal.</li>\n<li>Enchantments -&nbsp; Shown below.</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Impaling [Levels - 5]: Known enchant. Damage is only added to charging and throwing.</li>\n<li>Ignition [Levels - 1]: Thrown spears ignite and deal fire damage to those it hits. The effect is lost in rain and water.</li>\n<li>Loyalty [Levels - 3]: Known enchant.</li>\n<li>Infinity [Levels - 1]: Known enchant.</li>\n<li>Unbreaking [Levels - 3]: Known enchant.</li>\n<li>Mending [Levels - 1]: Known enchant. This enchantment has +50% the effect on this weapon than it does on other weapons.</li>\n<li>Curse of Vanishing: Known enchant.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>In-Game Application</strong></em>: The spear itself as an item grants the ability to try out the mechanics of a duel melee-ranged weapon. The weapons very early accessibility is limited by its low durability and opportunity of use. There's also a sort of primitive theme to it. I don't suggest the use of iron spears to give it a very concrete and distinguished place in the game.</p>\n<p>As a weapon, it is made viable by the mechanics I've added to the core of it and the trident. If you care enough to enchant one, you must love the hit and run strategy of it enough to put more work into it. It may even be made more viable than the trident to some, as the Spear can be used in all situations, but the trident is better during storms and in water.</p>\n<p>My biggest point (pun not intended) to be made here was the charging aspect. Instead of jumping in order to obtain a critical hit, you would have to run at your opponent. The concept would also apply to the trident as well as the spear, with its normal damage being lowered, and the crit damage being raised. This might make the trident just as viable a weapon as a normal diamond sword, and encourages skill for reward.</p>\n<p>When charging, a trident is held outwards with only one hand, like a gladiator. Damage will also have to be adjusted for this weapon as well, maybe up to 10 or 11 damage when charging.</p>\n<p>As a final note, I would also like to suggest the idea that when loyalty is used in conjunction with mending, every time half of the spear or tridents durability has been renewed, the loyalty level goes up (capping at 3), as it becomes more loyal to the player. I'm not as attached to this idea, as it can be easily overruled by simply enchanting it better, but it's still worth pointing out here.</p>\n<p>Thank you for considering my suggestion. More to come.</p>\n<p>To the original poster, I apologize for hijacking your own post, but&nbsp;I wasn't given any choice.</p>",

No loading time, so drawing back, just \"click\" and the spear is pointing in a different direction - which you can see from how it's held in you hand.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The spear would be the weapon equivalent of the shield, doing stuff wherever it's pointed, though in contrast to the shield it would have far less wide and tall a range (just limited to the area around the crosshairs), and could be pointed upwards if you look up. When the spear is held horizontally anything that walks into the end is damaged by 0.5 a heart. If the person holding the spear is moving, however, the damage increases.</p>\n<p>The amount of damage is based on the type of spear (wooden through diamond) and the speed at which the person is moving. So if you are riding a horse or flying when the spear touches something you do much more damage and knockback than if you were just sprinting, and you do more damage if you sprint than if you walk, and none if you stand still.</p>\n<p>In general, I was thinking the tiers would have a base multiplier, or power or something like that and then round. A formula I'm happy with is speed divided by 6, 3, 2.25 and 1.75, for wood/gold, stone, iron and diamond respectively. With wood, walking does 0.7 hearts of damage, rounded to 0.5, sprinting 0.93 rounded to 1, riding an average horse does 1.5 and riding a maximum horse does 2.416, so 2.5. With stone, it's walking 1.5, sprinting 2, average horse 3 and maximum horse 5. Iron, it's walking 2, sprinting 2.5, an average horse 4 and a maximum horse 6.5. With diamond it's walking 2.5, sprinting 3, average horse 5 and maximum horse 8.</p>\n<p>Knockback would be calculated similarly.</p>\n<p>The fact the spear does damage by you moving is the reason for the modes - so you don't accidentally impale your pets or your friends.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>You can attack normally with a spear, however, but only when held horizontally, and&nbsp;<strong class=\"bbc\">only&nbsp;</strong>at a range of three blocks. This means you can't accidentally hit your horse if on horseback, and means it is a viable way of fighting against an opponent on horseback, since you get extra range. I would make spears do half a heart less damage than swords of equal value (1,5, 2, 2.5, 3 hearts), but increase their recovery speed to 0.5, which means their attack speed would be 1/0.5 = 2 and their DPS 2 * (3, 4, 5, 6) = (6, 8, 10, 12), very close to that of swords. But since each hit is less damaging and you need to be at a certain range for the damage to count, swords are still the better choice when fighting against opponents on foot - a swordman can bridge the distance and chop you up.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>If you hit something that's within two blocks range of you, you switch from horizonal to vertical (this is the indicator the opponent is too close) and any hit you land does as much damage as your fist, but won't remove durability from the spear.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This is how I'd like the spear to work.</p>",

I was thinking it would be a great way to smooth out the progression to a trident. However, there should be a tweaks</p>\n<p>The problem is the spears speed, it's reach is great, but would result in some furiousing deaths in PVP. It could be slower than a sword, but faster than a ax. We also could take Malloon Tarka's idea, it could do no knock back unless someone is sprinting. Which help limits any cheesy deaths in PVP.</p>\n<p>I personally, also think Mojang won't make it a two handed weapon as we can see from the Trident. Generally to help smooth the spear out, the standern minecraft tiers should apply. Some trident's sea themed enchantments maybe should not transfer over to the spear as it would generally cheapen the trident. However, new enchantments could be:</p>\n<p>A enchatment to throw the spear further.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>A charging enchatment that throw you at your enemy. (You need to be on the ground to use it, also it has a cool-down plus a crit for a successful hit. It also has even longer cool down for missing. Thanks Mad3nder mad3nder for the idea)</p>\n<p>A Area of Damange enchatment. (A lower sweep attack that knock enemies into the air all around and far from the player. It take a long time to deploy and use, if hit, it would cancel. All targets with shields are knocked back as well.)</p>",

I can totally understand not wanting to give up the convenience of filling water bottles straight from a single water source.

        "body": "<p>Why shouldn't milk bottles be obtainable directly from the cow? There is no limitation currently to milking cows with a bucket, so there won't be any complications made regarding the \"value\" of a milk bucket vs milk bottle.</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, all potions (excepting weakness) utilise a nether wart as a base ingredient. It may be seen as an amplifier of the potion's abilities, and can explain the lack of effect of soups currently; drinking a rabbit stew and being able to jump extra high because of it doesn't make sense while other food items do not grant effects (for example, golden carrots lack effect unless brewed with an awkward potion).</p>\n\n<p>In response to your concept of potion and soup stacking, soup absolutely should be stackable, as the space taken up by soup, or the time taken to craft it as needed, makes it undesirable as a food source. Potions are another kind of concept entirely; for the purpose of a boss fight or match in PVP, a single potion with boosted effect time lasts longer than needed. Rather than instant damage and instant health potions, most potions would remain unaffected by this change.</p>\n\n<p>I'll finish this comment with another proposal to a cauldron's functionality:\n<br />I see the curing ability of milk, given its easy access, to be unbalanced. One possible use for cauldrons could be in brewing antidotes to individual potion effects; objects opposite to or matching a potion's recipe may be mixed in the cauldron to produce 3 antidotes for only that potion's effect. These antidotes would replace milk as a cure, although milk may keep its curative properties by acting as a base for these antidotes. One result of this change would be a lack of cure to the wither effect, as it lacks a potion and therefore a recipe; fighting the Wither boss and skeletons would be a more dangerous task.</p>",

I think that maybe instead of replacing the functionality of milk buckets with milk bottles entirely, maybe milk bottles should just take off a small amount of the effects' duration, while milk buckets still remove the full effect. But I do think that cauldrons do really need to be more useful, and maybe even harder to craft. I think that changing the crafting recipe to use better materials would give them a lot more value, thus making structures like witch huts have a bit more value, as well. I feel like cauldrons should also play a much bigger part with potions somehow, like they could actually store potions the same way they do water, and maybe you could even mix potions together to create a combination of effects. I don't really see why not. But yeah, Brewing is a part of the game that goes hugely un-noticed and isn't cared about very much, and it needs an update.</p>",

And add a “magic” mushroom soup which would give you one strong/long positive and negative effect of any kind. And the shrooms would be found in the new cave biomes when they are added with “Caves and Cliffs” and they would be a white color and have a rainbow Pearlescent and would produce a little bit of light, less than a red stone torch. The shroom could be eaten raw which would give weak/short effects, again one positive and negative effect. And the soups still wouldn’t be stackable, but  maybe would have multiple (like 3” uses, like cake, but in your hand, excluding the “Magic” shroom soup which would have one use. And the milk thing you said sounds cool too, but I think each one you drink should clear one effect type. So if you are poisoned and have weakness, drinking a milk bottle would clear one of those effects. Because of they clear all that would be pretty op because one bucket fills up like 5 bottles.</p>",

Another use it could have is that it could be compacted twice, because it is supposedly common, and it could be used when double compacted for a beacon.

Tons of space themed blocks and items could be added.</p>\n\n<p>And to add to the meteorite idea, I think it should be generated into the world and you go and explore to find them. It would be a sphere structure partially in the ground. You break your way inside and there is a mob of some kind maybe an alien and a cluster of a material you would have to go to space in order to get it otherwise. Idk just some thoughts.</p>",

Unlike the nether and end portal, it would be cool if you can create the portal in any shape or direction, as long as you have a block requirement. I think this spatorium is really cool, and I feel, in order to include the netherite items from the recent nether update, you should have to use nether pickaxe to mine spatorium, to craft the ultimate items. I think there should also be different kinds of spatorium biomes so you can find different ores. A cool idea would be if you can use this spatorium to upgrade your nether and elytra items to different forms. Ik this is a little crazy, but it would be really cool, plus a new realm would be real cool. Even though the nether is not that old, adding a new realm and of course, new mobs with the realm, and new items armor and weapons, would be cool. Also sorry to go on a tangent here, but it would be cool if you could make a spatorium sword or unique blade out of spatorium that causes mobs to drop essence that causes you to make mob armor to gain the skills of the mob. Crazy ideas, but that’s just some stuff I thought of. </p>",

I also don't see the value of a new ore type for armor or tool-making, but I think we could get something else that would be rare and valuable. Either a block that has useful properties like obsidian (blast resistant, immovable by pistons) or block that has a valuable mechanic like a lodestone. A unique decorative item like the dragon egg would make a fun exploration-based trophy. Perhaps a floating, glowing chunk of rock that glows brighter during meteor showers.</p>",

I feel like that's a wood colour that's missing from the current set of wood types available (as of 1.16).&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As for concerns about this breaking the game by making wood auto-farmable: it wouldn't. Wood is already afk-farmable, just takes a lot of skill and effort to build one. And other things that used to not be farmable get a farming option all the time without it breaking the game. That's a necessary process - As minecraft adds fatures, players need to be given free time to explore those, by removing the need to perform menial tasks such as chopping wood from the first day all the way past the end.</p>\n<p>Also, bamboo isn't immediately available on most worlds, and even if you start in a bamboo forest, all the other stuff you need for an auto farm still needs to be gathered, so it wouldn't even change the early game progression at all. But on all the worlds without bamboo at spawn, it would make finding bamboo a much more rewarding achievement, because of the wood farming option it would open up.</p>\n<p>Finally, this is another one of those times where it might be appropriate to have real-life concerns influence Minecraft development, as has happened before when the Parrots' food of choice was changed from cookies to seeds. It's been mentioned before that bamboo is used extensively as a wood-analogue building material in Asia.</p>",

(+3 blocks) The <em>rope</em> can be placed like scaffollding, but only from top to bottom. On the <em>ropes</em> you can climb and descend as if on ladder. You can make a&nbsp;<em><strong>rope ladder</strong></em> from a&nbsp;<em>rope</em> and bamboo, with can be placed in the same way as a rope. The dispenser will throw out the rope ladder when the redstone signal is activated and collect it if the redstone signal is absent.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thanks, Google translate...</p>",

Or the player could interact with the minecart and switch it from the engine to moving furnace. The moving furnace mode wouldn't have the 'push the minecart in front of it' feature, but instead, just act like a normal furnace (similar to the chest in a minecart). The UI when using the furnace minecart in moving furnace mode would be the same as a normal furnace. In engine mode, the furnace minecart would attach to the minecart in front of it with some sort of small rod. The furnace minecart UI in engine mode would have a single slot for fuel and a flame that signifies the fuel-burning (similar to the flame icon in a normal furnace). If the modes are not a good idea, Mojang could just add smoke coming out of the furnace minecart when it's running (the particles would be the same or similar to campfire smoke).</p>",

I've read all the comments and I think the best way to go about implementing this in the game would be:</p>\n<p>1. The Recipe --- Since the stone cutter uses stone and iron the woodcutter should use logs and iron</p>\n<p>2. Functionality --- It wood ;) work the same as the stone cutter and should be able to craft all possible wood based blocks from planks even doors and trapdoors (which would be crafted one at a time instead of 3 doors)&nbsp; and would use two wood planks.</p>\n<p>3. Special Function --- The wood cutter allows us to now make stairs, slabs, shelves, and wooden walls with both stripped and regular logs by placing in a log instead of wood plank to be cut.</p>\n<p>Please add this finally Mojang after 6 years of asking. Thankyou</p>",

Considering the method of obtaining the item is so unique and potentially dangerous, it would be a challenge to the game's technical community to design effective ways of farming the bullets. The item's potion variations (as described by previous comments) has applications across lots of playstyles, being useful offensively in splash form, defencively as an escape mechanism, allowing for new types of minigames and parkour courses, transport within bases- the list just goes on and on.</p>\n\n<p>I have two cents to put in here; the first is that the item may fit better into the game under a different name. \"Bullets\" is suggestive of guns, which as can be seen by the description of the blocks and items category is a theme being avoided in vanilla gameplay. My second cent is that, should the potion variation be introduced, the Shulker Lead may be redundant except for its extra length.</p>\n\n<p>All in all, this is the most fitting suggestion I've seen so far.

Melted down it becomes a material (like gold nuggets vs gold ingots)</p>\n\n<p>I think the color seems fine too\n<br />Netherbricks have a dark red color while netherite is mostly black. Some people have suggested having streaks of orange or diamond in the armor but that would be farther from the style of other armors. Considering it comes from \"ancient\" debris I think it makes since it has an old look to it. If the armor was other nether colors (yellow, orange or red) then it wouldn't really seem as rugged as it does now. Black makes it feel like it's from the ground.</p>\n\n<p>The texture of the armor could perhaps be changed, but I don't think it should be majorly changed.\n<br />Considering it requires diamond armor, it might make more sense to use some more of the flat looking design elements from diamond armor, but not completely flat looking. Personally I think it already looks different enough to set it apart from other armors while still retaining minecraft's style.</p>",

The only thing that still feels tacky in that way is the name: \"netherite\" just seems like a very low-hanging fruit.

Nether-ite.</p>\n\n<p>\"The Rock and Mineral names can be traced quite often to Greek and to Latin. It is common practice to add an “ite” to a mineral name. The suffix “ite” is derived from the Greek word lithos (from its adjectival form -ites), meaning rock or stone. While the vast majority of mineral names end in “ite,” some have the suffixes “ine” or “ide.” Most original names referred to physical characteristics of the rock or mineral, to the location where the rock or mineral was first found, or sometimes to the magical powers attributed to that rock or mineral. In fact this way of naming stones is still common today, with the addition of naming the rock and mineral for a person.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.geologypage.com/2018/03/minerals-rocks-get-names.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.geologypage.com/2018/03/minerals-rocks-get-names.html</a></p>",

The boomerang. The idea being that if you miss your target it would return for another try. But, as the physics of Minecraft are not like the physics of the real world, perhaps it would return even if it hit an enemy. Then, like a bow or sword or any other physical thing it would wear out and disappear or need to be repaired before it was destroyed. I hope that is an inspiring thought and a neat little twist to the game.</p>",

The crafting recepie could be two reinforced sticks (made from two sticks put together with slime) and one iron. How about when it comes back it just goes back to the general detection it was thrown from and then you can add the loyalty enchantment so it will always come back no matter the obstacles. Maybe you could add a new enchantment called \"Digging\" and then it could be used for a way to mine things quicker and the stronger the level the tougher the blocks it can mine. For example, level 1 could mine dirt, leaves, wood, and other things you could normaly mine with your hand. Level 2 could mine stone, ores, blackstone, bassalt, and other things you could mine with an iron pickaxe. Level 3 could mine obsidian, ancient debris, and other things you could mine with a diamond or netherite pickaxe. Another enchantment you could have is \"gripping\". Gripping 1 could pick up items you have mined or are already on the ground and arrows that have landed from being shot.</p>",

At that point I think players would appreciate easier inventory management which extra space in the shulker boxes would bring. I would be fine even with full \"double chest\" space. Also, given how difficult is to get netherite ingots you would still likely have only very few such shulkers.</p>\n<p>One more important aspect of this idea that is worth mentioning is that if netherite shulkerboxes would have different texture and could have all 16 colors as well, this would give you twice as many different icons in inventory to quickly find the box you need.</p>",

Minecraft, as I see it, has multiple stages where the type of game it is changes.</p>\n<p>- It starts as a survival<br>- Then it becomes an adventure when you gather all the tools, fight the mobs, visit all the dimension and finally slay the dragon<br>- And last part is the end game, where it becomes more of a creative game - building amazing builds or farms</p>\n<p>To me both Netherite &amp; Shulker boxes are end games items - especially when combined. Why is that important? Because at this point of the game, losing your materials in lava or having a creeper destroy your shulker chest monster is more of a frustration than anything else.</p>\n<p>To keep consistent with other netherite items netherite shulker boxes should:<br>- Survive &amp; float in lava<br>- Have high blast resistance (at least to survive a creeper explosion)<br>- Cost 1 netherite ingot in smithing table (the feature should be balanced so 1 ingot makes sense, not the other way around)</p>\n<p>In addition I would be strongly in favor of them to be also dyable - this would be huge, as it would allow you to have two shulker boxes of the same color with different icon (so you can have e.g. one normal green shulker for plants and 1 netherite green shulker for green blocks, or one for redstone and one for red blocks etc.)</p>\n<p>As for the inventory, imo it should remain the same as normal shulker box - otherwise it would be difficult to design redstone systems that would work with both.&nbsp;</p>",
