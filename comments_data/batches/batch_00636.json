If the latter, the logs above it, if on fire, will drop Ash Layers only. Ones below a Charred Log will always be charred or untouched. This will prevent floating columns from forming, as the tree will either be completely gone or a stump/pole occasionally topped with Ash Layers, which fall down onto logs that have charred or are untouched. Planks turn into either Ash Layers or simply disappear.</p>\n<p>This would make an otherwise catastrophic fire caused by a lava pool or lightning strike more immersive, leaving behind burned stumps and pillars, Ash falling to the ground as a building burns down. Fires can be put out with Bottles of Water, allowing for firefighting.</p>\n<p>You can break a burnt log with your fist for a&nbsp;<em>chance</em>&nbsp;to get 1 charcoal, or use an Axe for a 100% chance or the Fortune enchant to get slightly more. Charred Logs = 1 Charcoal in a Furnace, as fuel. A little more \"lossy\" and more involved, it encourages players to use better fuel sources more often. This introduces fuel strategy in early game, and might incentivize more mining.</p>\n<p>You can craft a burnt log with x Charcoal and x Piles of Ash. Burning a Log in a Furnace will net you a Charred Log every time, burning a Charred Log in a Furnace will net you an Ash block every time.</p>\n<p>Ash blocks work like Snow blocks, an Ash Layer which breaks into a Pile of Ash, 9 of which combine into an Ash Block (a gravity block).</p>",

It is meant to be a grindy early game fuel and torch source, and an aesthetic things for builders and mapmakers.), Ash/Ash Layers, and better Fire mechanics, as well as adds new mechanics like using water bottles to put out fires.
