I felt that things like Dripstone and Amethyst were unnecessary and weird-looking. Archeology seemed too overpowered and confusing at the moment (what are pots and why do you get diamond blocks from gravel)</p>\n<p>When the new ore textures were made, i&nbsp;<em>hated them.</em> But after time, I easily got used to them. When playing on the snapshot with Dripstone, I loved the 2d pictures I hated just a week before.</p>\n<p>Have you actually played any of the 1.17 snapshots? If not, it does not matter. All new things feel modded at first, believe me, i was told that by others on this site. But just give 1.17 a chance. When Minecraft updates the game, sure it will feel a little strange at first, but in most cases, you will grow to love them!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>One thing I would also like to add is that you did not give any reasoning for why you said these features were \"bad.\" Others, like Amethyst, the only reasoning you gave is that it made the game feel modded. Remember, all overworld updates are bound to have stuff that is in a mod, as that is the nature of the internet.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Just give 1.17 a chance, and you will grow to love it as you and the rest of us go on the site talking about how the new tumbleweeds don't fit the game. I hope this comment helped. :)</p>",

Now for Java you can play the older versions still through the launcher, and it's super easy with Multi-MC. On the Java end the ease of changing things with data packs and mods is actually a perk to other games with similar vibes to me. I do wish it was a little easier through the official launcher to turn on and off mods in more of a Multi-MC style system with each interaction being isolated so you don't have to worry about conflicting mods.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Now there are things that have bugged me with 1.17 bundles being a half-measure being one, and I get the frustration on lacking full builds, slabs, walls, etc. for some of the new stone blocks and copper. However, given the expansion of the world height, which honestly the new caves look amazing, the minor changes in texture is a common thing looking.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>However, I do agree it would be nice for more player controls in world generation, perhaps options to control structures in a finer degree, yes/no amethyst, yes/no on dungeons (excluding stronghold), y/n for Pillagers/Villagers, etc. Or even removal of certain world gen blocks, textures would likely need to be a resource pack thing, but in a game that prides itself on sandbox creativity, fine-tuned world generation would be included in giving it to players to make each world their own.&nbsp;</p>",

We know that the Warden locks down and path-finds towards the player whenever it is hit (as well as whenever it detects a lot of vibrations from the same source), even though shooting a&nbsp; projectile while sneaking does not allow the Sculk to detect any vibrations directly from you. This still makes sense because of course a mob that can sense movement would also have a strong perspective of what's surrounding it even when blind, similar to the feeling you got when someone is around you but much stronger, and therefore when a projectile hits it it would know where that came from. If it can lock down and pathfind towards a player or mob that hits it from afar, then it is definitely extremely aware of anything close enough to it, which is why I think it would definitely be able to traverse through fluids and avoid hitting and getting stuck at walls. Additionally, as it has such a strong perspective of surroundings, I think that if a player or mob gets within a small radius from the Warden, it will know there's something there and also start locking down regardless of whether it actually recieved any vibrations. Otherwise there's nothing preventing players from sneaking up to the Warden and hugging him, which isn't very fearful, as you should want to keep as much distance between you and the Warden.</p>",

Having the blocks and the Warden without the biome will break a lot of the charm of these features, and we wouldn't really be able to test how everything is meant to work because it is not within the proper environment. Besides, these features are the ones that need that new timeline the most so that they are able to completely fulfill their design and fully polish them so that they're ready to be tested by the community and so that the feedback we give is actually valuable. So you can expect when they come into the snapshots, they will all be together, because that is basically how they need to work. Also, you can get the announced blocks pretty easily with the current underground generation. They made Dripstone clusters generate occasionally in the current caves, and you can also trade for Dripstone blocks with Masons. Besides, you can find Moss blocks in the chests of Shipwrecks, which you can then bonemeal to get all of the Lush Cave blocks. Glowberries can also be found in Mineshaft chests. Deepslate and Tuff generate in blobs below Y=16. So it's not <em>extremely&nbsp;</em>biased towards Creative.&nbsp;Axolotls don't really need the Lush Caves; they aren't nearly as connected with the Lush Caves as the Warden is with the Deep Dark, or else they wouldn't have released them before releasing Lush Caves; same for the other features.</p>",
