They're just green and called emeralds. To quote Minecraft developer Dinnerbone:</p>\n<p>\"We actually didn't go with rubies and changed to emeralds at last minute for the villager trading because I'm colour blind and couldn't easily spot the difference between the ruby ore and redstone ore until I was up close\"</p>\n<p>It's kind of redundant to have two red ores in the game, isn't it? But then again, perhaps rubies could be introduced as pink/magenta rather than red.</p>\n<p>Lanterns, lecterns, and crying obsidian were all added in a way that brought something new and useful to the game. So before you can add rubies, you have to come up with a reason for them to exist.</p>",
