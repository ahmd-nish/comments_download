        "body": "<p>That's.... An impossible request. For a few reasons,</p>\n<p>First, I'll assume for a second you're getting this idea similar to what terraria did with their official tmodloader. While that would be an interesting idea to have a launcher dedicated to mods, Everything else you wrote is impossible;</p>\n<p>1. Making additions or games without knowing how to code (you need to know how to design for mods as well) is already hard and not worth it.<br>2. Running fabric mods and forge mods is not much of an issue (the mods aren't locked to the launcher) but I don't see how that's important. However, You can't run mods from different versions. Lets say 1.8 and 1.12 as an example, Since combat changed drastically then different mods may work differently and since mods were specifically tailored and created to that specific version, There's no telling what would happen in other HIGHER versions of the game.<br>3. Changing the mods while playing without restarting is also impossible. You It's like saying to take an apple from a tree you didn't plant, When you set certain mods and make a new world for example some mods load certain biomes and mechanics to the game while you open it. It's impossible to \"change mods\" while being \"loaded in\" since the entire point of loading into the game is loading in the content. Texture packs can be changed since they're a minor part of the game but you can't add code into an existing world and expect it to work.</p>\n<p>*Thanks for reading,<br>-Beelzeboul</p>",
