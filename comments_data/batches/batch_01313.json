However, the low spawn rate mainly hurts the player in the early game, and since an early game player isn't likely to have enhanced gear, fortune does nothing to affect the balance.</p>\n<p>The linear fall-off of resource distribution makes caving a very inefficient way to get iron. If the cave changes elevation even slightly you will see significantly less iron. Having a peak in the distribution means strip mining at y32 is the best way to get iron. This once again punishes early game mining. In the past, an early game player would explore caves, gather resources, and then transition into strip mining once they had a good enough pickaxe.</p>\n<p>It feels like there is a huge barrier in the early game.

        "body": "<p>Yes! Agreed! The world generation in 1.18 snapshots has turned the underground into swiss cheese. There is now too much negative space, filled with air or water. Continents and islands are \"floating\" on large open spaces full of air and water, supported by narrow columns of rock. That would be silly enough, but all of this negative space is full of air or water and not useful materials LIKE IRON. The game came out of Infiniminer. The idea was that you could just tunnel in any direction and find enough iron to keep you in tools to keep going, if that's what you wanted to do. After 1.18 you cannot dig a 2x2 block tunnel in any direction for more than 100 meters without running into a large empty space. This is too much empty space, or worse, flooded space. It's hard to build anything underground or make a straight tunnel or stairway down. There are too many caves. The game is MINEcraft not SPELUNKcraft. The game's strength is in its adaptability and flexibility. Not everybody wants to spend all of their time doing nothing but cave crawling. You can make fewer caves and still satisfy the cave exploration people. A survival player should not have to walk (or boat) a couple hundred kilometers just to find a mountain with some iron in it, not to mention the problem of transporting the iron back to another biome where the player may have built a house or other features. This slows the game way down. The idea is to enhance survival mode, not make it unrecognizable.</p>",

I now do not use iron for more than one singular pickaxe to obtain diamond, and then I have to switch to diamond tools so as not to waste iron (but I still use stone tier tools for what does not require iron or better to mine). Please sort this out, Iron should be rarer than coal and copper, but more common than the other ores. What is supposed to be the new ideal level for iron?

I argue that Microsoft DOES NOT HAVE A RIGHT to globally ban accounts where private servers are concerned. I have no issue with Microsoft publishing a global ban list that servers can utilize however this should be optional whether or not a server enforces it. Although frankly its a moot point given moders have already created server plugins to strip out chat reporting and modded servers can require specific clients with the functionality removed in order to join the only real issue is when someone gets banned on a realms server</p>",

Not sure why the other part was removed, so I'll put it as a comment (only optional part) here.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The idea was to use Echo Shards too, as in they stored the sound whilst goat horns were the means for the players to play them. This concept originated from the Echo Shard's own name - as in, \"echo\" reminded me of perpetuating sound, and thus being able to store different things inside it. Who knows what it's actually storing when found in ancient cities though.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Anyhow, while being held in the off-hand, my idea was for the echo shard to pick up the nearest sound effect to it every of seconds. It would make for a dynamic system with it's own new challenges to store some different sounds - how would you get the thunder sfx, for example? There's always rain! But it's possible.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>An echo shard combined with a goat horn would put the echo shard's sound effect inside the goat horn - thus it'll make that sound once played. This should not, imho, consume the echo shard. It should still have it's current sound effect after that and such could be overwritten using the system of the above paragraph. Making one echo shard alone pretty valuable, although more than one could very often come in handy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I would put concept art/images here, but my suspicions are that this is what got my other post removed. So I hope this is enough for descriptions.</p>",
