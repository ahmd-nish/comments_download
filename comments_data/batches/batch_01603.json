They would easily knock you off the side if you were trying to bridge to another island, and it would make exploring the End without an Elytra just about impossible. :|</p>\n<p>Instead they should just reduce the spawn rate... and maybe make it take more sleepless nights before they spawn often.</p>",

Instead of a ghast, what if your a moon jellyfish meets a slime? All in classic end purple, of course.<br><br>With this idea, you could jump on it and it would have the same effect as a slime block, bouncing you back up, so you have to be practiced at controlling your falls when interacting with them. They could be breedable by feeding them chorus fruits. I'm not sure if it would have to go to a point on the ground the way chorus fruit bounces the player around, or if it could put the jellies at a random y-level. When they spawn/are born, they could have a set y-level they like to stay at, only leaving that y-level for food, when fed, or to mate then teleporting back to their preferred y-level after a set amount of time. That could add a goal to find or create a jelly that stays at a player's ideal y-level, be that as high as possible or a happy middle point.<br><br>They could drop a purple goo that could be used to make crying obsidian. I think a block of the purple goo would also be cool, but I am unsure how it could be differentiated from regular slime. It should do something cool, since it would be a pain to get as the mob likes to hang out over open void.<br><br>For giggle points, it could be the first flying ridable mob, following a chorus fruit on a rod. The only downside is the set elevation and that it moves slower than walking speed.</p>",

I support the idea of the Soul Guardian that becomes your friend, kind of like wolves he will teleport when you go too far.<br>But the Soul Guardian wouldn't be able to leave the nether and walk on any other block that isnt soul sand/soil, otherwise it will be too overpowered<br>And probably smart to bound 1 Soul Guardian to each soul sand valley, limiting you from creating an army. Also Soul Guardians wouldn't attack other Guardians.<br><br>I feel like my version is a little more balanced, and I've taken many more things into account from the technical side.

They can be domesticated by giving sheep meat, xoloescuincles are very weak to the cold, so they would appear in the desert, taiga or table biome.‎</span></div>\n<div class=\"post-body\">&nbsp;</div>\n<div class=\"post-body\"><span>-Translated by admin</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>",
