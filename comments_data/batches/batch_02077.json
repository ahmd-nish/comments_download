I am now playing on a modded server where we have the option to carry passive mobs including villagers in our arms, which gets the job done perfectly for me but doesn't feel very realistic and like it should be in vanilla Minecraft.\n<br />A possible solution would be an option in their trading menu or a special keybind or item to tell them to follow you. This way you could take multiple villagers with you and it wouldn't feel weird.\n<br />Or maybe there could be some kind of job offer item that would be linked to a workstation. You would give that to unemployed villagers and they would move there on their own (they could walk away from you and then be teleported there).\n<br />I hope that we get an update like this because I really hate dealing with villagers and moving them through difficult terrain or even the nether.</p>",

Having Treasure books in the range adds that enchant in the random generation, having enchanted books of a particular enchant increases the odds of that enchant appearing in the random generation. This would keep the old shelves important (they determine level) but chiseled reduce the randomness as players grind out enchanted books.&nbsp; Given the space, an enchanting table pulls from about 7 to 9 chiseled shelves (with 15 regular) can be placed around it. Storing up to 54 books, which gives room for more enchantments, especially Treasure Enchants to then add in and encourage exploration.&nbsp;</p>",
