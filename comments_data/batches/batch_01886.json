        "body": "<p>The beauty of Minecraft is (in my humble opinion) the balance of practical purposes and visual purposes. Every aspect of Minecraft should be filled with this balance. For example take the trial chambers for example, it supplies us with both cool visual building blocks, lots of tuff bricks, lots of different kinds of already waxed copper. And it also give us things with a practical purpose, wind charges, emeralds, weapons, armor, and the new mace. It's a perfect balance.</p>\n<p>Mining provides you with visual building blocks like stone and deepslate, diorite, granite, and copper. And for a practical purpose it offers ores like coal, iron, gold, redstone, lapis lazuli, and diamond. Its a perfect balance.</p>\n<p>Then there's blocks and items that serve both, these ones are the best because it offers an even more complete balance. Wood is a good example, you need tons of wood for any common build, and you need tons of wood for weapons and all sorts of other practical crafts. Its a perfect balance.</p>\n<p>I could go on but that's of point, as of right now the Pale Gardens have lots of visual rew<em><strong>a</strong></em>rds; white wood, resin, pale moss, and eyeblossoms. But it carries no practical rew<em><strong>a</strong></em>rd other than wood. As a biome with more danger than others, it needs some practical gain.</p>",

It despawns when the creaking heart is destroyed or deactivated.</p>\n<p>Let's say that the creaking heart being destroyed makes the creaking drop the logs. Then what if the player just places it back? Creaking respawns, and it can be done over and over again. And if the creaking heart block actually has to be destroyed (e.g. non-silk touch tool), then it's not renewable after all.</p>\n<p>The other option is for the creaking to drop logs whenever it despawns, regardless of whether the creaking heart was actually destroyed or not. While this makes it renewable, it's even more exploitable than the previous option. I could just setup an observer clock to activate and deactivate the creaking heart over and over, getting practically infinite logs.</p>\n<p>So while this idea seems good in theory, it falls apart quickly when you put it into practice.</p>",

        "body": "<p>I would like to point out that in the video (assuming we're both talking about the same video) they didn't actually confirm the theory of Illagers being sick villagers, this was simply the name, the original idea &nbsp;was ill-built-villagers, which does not in any way mean sick, than they changed it to ill-villagers. This does imply sickness, but then it was changed once again to Illagers. The first two names, both have rather different meanings, and were both changed/scrapped before the end result.</p>\n<p>It is true of course that the video used the sickness idea throughout, but I wouldn't take this too seriously, I think its more of an ongoing joke, Mojang rarely just tells us the lore behind something.</p>\n<p>Most importantly however, at the end of the video they said that the in-game origin of the Illagers will remain a mystery, which means that, while them being sick Villagers is a possibility, this video does not actually prove it.</p>\n<p>Personally, I think that they are simply a society of villagers who will stop at nothing for the success of their group. They are far too organized and professional for sick villagers, and it seems weird to me that some sickened villagers could build structures that are far beyond anything regular villagers have managed. As for their grey color, I would argue that they smeared themselves with a sort of mashed up mushroom paste which prevents the undead from targeting them (the zombie apocalypse is mushroom related).</p>\n<p>I could be wrong of course. :)</p>",
