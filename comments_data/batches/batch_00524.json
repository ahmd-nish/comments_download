Add a builder class villager and the architecture block to make a builder the same way a fisherman or armourer get created when they find a barrel or blast furnace. I'm guessing this is inspired by the structure block that map makers have available to them.</p>\n<p>I'd image having the item (blueprint) that when placed down creates a construction site (marked with a sign on the ground) based on the blueprint. This construction site will have a visible bounding box based on the width and height of the saved structure. If the bounding box intersects with any block, construction will be halted. The player has to basically make a clear construction site for the builder to keep working. Id also imagine that the builder will go near the construction site (probably just outside the bounding box) and blocks will get filled in periodically. The builder could be leveled up like other villagers and the higher the level the faster they build.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",
