Imagine looking down and seeing the dizzying height...&nbsp;<em>without</em> nose diving towards the ground and losing elevation. This would bring so much more depth to flight by elytra.</p>\n<p>–Computer is slow and chunks don't load quick enough. A solution would be to have an enchantment that decreases velocity and perhaps increases glide ratio, similar to how slow falling does.</p>\n<p>–<em>I am operating a propelled aircraft!</em> Make flying more strategic by adding thermals and wind, perhaps in a weather update. Another benefit from this is the fact that airspeed and windspeed are two different values, i.e. a landing station is up ahead, and enough wind is blowing to make a slow and steady (very easy) approach onto the station.</p>",
