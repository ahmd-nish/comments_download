It consists of 1-5 ruined shelters and a campfire surrounded by logs to sit on. The campfire has a small chance of being lit or having food on it. The shelters can contain chests with loot similar to what you might find in villages. There is a chance to find logs, planks, sticks, coal, food, and very rarely, an emerald. They can also generate with tools up to iron. The wood used could be one of two things:</p>\n<p>1) always oak</p>\n<p>2) based on the biome, with oak for biomes with no trees</p>\n<p>I haven't decided which is best.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I hope you appreciate my addition to this idea. I also agree that the biome a camp is in could affect the size and loot.</p>",

The higher the level, the brighter your helmet gets.</p>\n<p><em>Sharp-eyed</em>&nbsp;- Outlines nearby mobs in the mine, and indicates which blocks are silverfish-infested.</p>\n<p><em>Arachno-resistant</em>&nbsp;- Reduces damage from spiders by half, and allows you to walk through cobwebs without slowing down (useful for exploring Mineshafts)</p>\n<p><em>&nbsp;(I can’t think of a name for this one, help!) 1-5</em>&nbsp;- Increases the speed for mining stone by 25%, adds 5% every level</p>",
