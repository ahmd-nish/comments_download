So, I've read through your whole system, and although I do appreciate all of the time you put into it, there are many things that I don't agree with.</p>\n<p>1) Why exactly do we need to get rid of the tipped arrows crafting recipe? It is more efficient with the potion, but costs a dragon's breath, so it seems balanced to me.</p>\n<p>2)&nbsp;I don't see why the amplifications are needed, especially since \"useless\" is very subjective. I don't think Mojang wanted Leaping to turn you into a living trampoline. Also, Regeneration is useful because it lasts longer than golden apples and is quicker to use if in splash form.</p>\n<p>3) Absolutely nobody will like the strategic pros and cons of potions, mainly because the cons of potions are that they are hard to get and don't stack. Add in negative effects on top of that? Forget it. Nobody would use potions anymore.</p>\n<p>4) Dragon's milk is one of the only ideas that could make sense, but <em>only</em>&nbsp;if it were added as an alternative to milk that wouldn't clear positive effects.</p>\n<p>5) &nbsp;The bewitched milk is kind of interesting as a concept, too, but I don't think it fits with the illusioner mob.</p>\n<p>6) I have mixed feelings about the whole Thick and Mundane potion ideas. For example, I don't think Mojang will want to add in potion versions of Mining Fatigue, Haste, or Decay, because that would make the&nbsp;<em>How Did We Get H</em><em>ere&nbsp;</em>advancement&nbsp;way too easy.</p>\n<p>7) Combining potions is a definite no-no; see <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/8f5btg/cool_updates_to_the_cauldron_that_should_be_done/dybaxdf/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this reddit comment</a> by Helen Zbihlyj to see why.</p>\n<p>If you want to know what I think should be done to potions, you can read <a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360009222852-A-sensible-brewing-system-reform-In-depth-Ideas-5-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this post</a> and <a href=\"/hc/en-us/community/posts/360009327791-Make-cauldrons-potions-and-soups-more-useful-In-depth-Ideas-1-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this post</a>.

That is to say, when a player or mob is hurt, they blink red for half of a second, during which time they can't properly be hit again. The attack speed of 1.6 is already within a tenth of a second of that rate, so increasing the speed on the gold sword to 1.8, or anything else, doesn't really do much for it.</p>",
