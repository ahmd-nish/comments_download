The small amount of rooted dirt would make farming and mining in forest more difficult, with rooted dirt requiring double hoeing, and being much more difficult to dig through with fist or shovel (maybe stone tier shovel required). This would force players to choose optimal terrain for different things, farming more heavily on plains (which is already easier) and mining more in plains and mountains.</p>",

Other things you mentioned are actual disparities. Second, the developers are always working towards parity. There are two seperate teams for developing Bedrock and Java design, so that's why there are a lot of differences. Lately, however, they have been working more than ever on bringing the versions close together and making them virtually the same. The Nether Update was released almost on the same date on all platforms, so you can only expect it to be like that from now on. With this post you're just basically spamming the website with all of the disparities you can think of. I assure you they have almost all of these things in mind. Bedrock also has some advantages, like way better loot from Raids and an actually challenging Wither.</p>",

Also, I think more of the Minecraft Dungeons Missions should inspire a new biome or structure. For example, what if there was also a new jungle variant like the Jungle Awakens DLC?

When a creeper Is In the deep dark, It will Gladly Look for a watcher to wear as a hat, making the terrifying Creeper jockey, In which the creeper will then chase after other mobs, Allowing the watcher to lay waste to them. Meanwhile when a warden is nearby, It will gladly walk out of It's way, with the creeper stand still, maybe shivering, and the watcher looking at the warden emotionlessly, reassuring them that they're safe (Kind of wholesome, honestly). This Is to signify that the creeper Isn't like the other mobs, and that These plant-like mobs would gladly Get along with the monsters of the Moss-like sculk, while also giving players and mobs alike a fear they never felt before.</p>\n<p>meanwhile Scourges will gladly feed off of zombies, skeletons, and witches; (although not other Insect mobs), grabbing them with their mandibles and leeching their life force until they are dead. this could also signify how the scourges are also a major threat, and that If you aren't careful, you could end up like them.</p>",

It would be nice if the monster rooms were renamed as \"Crypts\" in 1.18, along with the introduction of some ACTUAL dungeons in the form of a \"Necropolis\". The necropolis could work as a large underground Tomb, a dungeon with gravestones (a new decoration that can summon undead mobs if infused with certain items while left in the dark) and various chests littered around. multiple rooms would surround the Necropolis, leading up to later rooms which contain a new mob: The paladin<br><br>the paladin would be a Undead Knight who's body is covered in stone armor, giving It as much defense as iron, while sporting a hearty 75 HP. They would always either be carrying a sword or axe alongside a shield, which they will use when a player runs at them. By killing the Paladin, they will drop the stone their armor was made out of (which could be stone, deepslate, or Calacite), their shield, 10-13 XP, and occasionally their weapon (may be enchanted).&nbsp;<br><br></p>",
