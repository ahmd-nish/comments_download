Most people who experience performance issues when running Minecraft despite good hardware experience such problems because they made their computer good at rendering graphics, not general computations. That is exactly the problem Xbox's have when running Minecraft. Their graphics cards are fairly good, but their CPUs are low end, even compared to an average laptop. That's the secret of consoles. The reason they are cheaper than gaming PCs that can do the same games is they gave up features that a PC user would rarely be okay with giving up.</p>\n<p>Your laptop will do better than any console I know anything about at virtually anything except gaming and AI.</p>",
