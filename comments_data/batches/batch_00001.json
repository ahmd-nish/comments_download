I think that with this idea kids can learn and geek out about your digital universe and make there own to geek out on. I think you should add this fun idea yo vanilla minecraft version too because thats the only version I have, and it doesn't have a lot of things in it or at least not as much as the other version wich makes me jealous of people who have those versions and that is not good to have for a companies health so you could prevent people from getting bored of vanilla minecraft version by taking my ideas. I also think that you should add some cool animals to your game cause the ones you already have are getting old (BUT IM NOT SAYING GET RID OF THEM I LOVE THEM AND RESPECT THEM) but I think you should some other cuties including, capabaras, alligators, lion, tigres, kangaroos, wood peckers, humming birds, some other cute birds, and most of all  I think that is NOT ok that we chose who our minecraft cats love and breed with I think that you should add something to give them real feelings. I also think that it would be super cool if we could give the cats a personality and they act as their given personality. </p>",

In all it just won't happen because Sony and Nintendo are too scared that someone may find a way to hack into their consoles through Minecraft addons</p>",

Also it would be great to have official approved addons that you can trust to download. A addon section added to minecraft marketplace that allows you to pick and choose certain addons like items on back or change color of leather to brown and you can go down the list picking and choosing. Most addons on marketplace or just a whole texture pack or a world download which is great but if you are only wanting a small item change or a mob retexture you can't it changes the whole game. I have like 20 addons active right now and it changes alot but each one changes it one by one not all of it. Like colorful containers changes the ui for all things that have a open ui like chests, crafting tables, etc. One addon let's me put the whole gui in dark mode But that's it nothing else. Small tweaks that can change just little bit to make it for fun but not change the whole game. Have a single addon on marketplace would allow people to customize there experience little by little.</p>",

Places like the snowy biomes, cold beaches and anywhere where there is usually snow year round should have times where snow will melt but not all of it will melt away. Different biomes would have different times for each season that way. Jungle biomes have a more tropical feel to them and they don't seem to have much rain like most tropical places do, I would recommend having more rain in that biome. That's all I have to add thank your for reading if you read it all. :)</p>",

Depending on the day, there would be air currents, and if storm clouds approach or if you are in a high and cold area, the wind would be more aggressive.</p>\n<p>The last thing I would like to suggest is that clouds are generated in different layers (unlike now, where they are only generated in one layer).

The app would crash a lot, and sometimes the addons I created wouldn't work, or even export! I've always wanted an Easy-Working app to create Addons for Minecraft. I have so many ideas for addons that I wanna share with other players, so the creation of the app that you're talking about, would make the community get even closer together.</p>",
