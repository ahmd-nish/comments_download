Maybe if Mojang added a way for things to kill through totems, then there could be a way to counteract that. On a base level though, they could just fit in with other enchantments.</p>\n<p>For Blessing of Holding, it does sound like you could have it counteract its curse, so that if they were both present, it would be normal. The only problem with blessing of holding is that 1. the whole point of the curses is that you're not meant to remove them and 2.&nbsp; it would allow for very bad griefing when in combination with curse of binding.</p>",

Currently, if you could just put on an armor chestplate and an elytra at the same time, it would just be way to unbalanced. Instead, there could be something like an armored elytra, which could be made combining netherite or diamonds, an elytra, and some other rare and difficult to obtain item. That way, late-game players have something to do. However, it wouldn't be as strong as a netherite chestplate. Perhaps as strong as a diamond one with less durability and limited enchantments.</p>",
