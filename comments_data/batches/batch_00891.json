It basically executes the command on the sender.</p>\n<p>To change the sender, you can use: <br>/execute as (selector) run (command)</p>\n<p>And then inside your command, you use the selector @s. I am not sure if it is possible to pass the selector from one command block to another (for example in your case, the blocks responsible from saying the npc's lines would take the information from the first command block, meaning even if someonr passed by they would have been already assigned to you), but you can use a function (a text file of type .mcfunction inside .minecraft/daves/YourWorld/datapacks/YourDatapack/YourDatapack_data/functions that executes multiple commands at once, so you can do:</p>\n<p><br>/execute as @p run (function)<br>And inside the function use the @s selector.</p>\n<p>It's a little more complicated than that but I am on phone and it would be hard to explain more details, I hope you understand that and good luck with your project.</p>",

You can't \"trace\" the redstone signal back to the button that started it, much less trace the press of a button to who pressed it. What you want is a target selector that targets the player that activated the command which is @s. When a command block activates, \"the player that activated the command\" is the command block itself, which is why @s doesn't apply. The redstone signal didn't activate the command; the player that pressed the button didn't activate the command; the command block itself activated the command.</p>\n<p>Like others have said, you can use JSON text to circumvent this because clicking JSON text means that <em>you</em>, the clicker, ran the command, so @s would apply there.</p>",
