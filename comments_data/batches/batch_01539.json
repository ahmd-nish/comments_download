Here are some examples:</p>\n<p>A phantom sees a torch. It swoops down to extinguish it. The player must reignite the torch.</p>\n<p>A phantom sees a lamp. It swoops down and smashes the lamp with a noise similar to that of shattering glass. The lamp itself is intact, but, again, the light is extinguished. You can relight the lamp, but it will have the same particles as torches and the texture of the glass will look broken.</p>\n<p>A phantom sees a jack o' lantern. It swoops down, penetrates the top of the pumpkin with its two talons and out with the lights. When the phantom flies off it will drop particles as if it has pieces of the pumpkin on it.</p>\n<p>A phantom sees glowstone, redstone lamp, sea lantern. It will swoop down and crack it. The blocks will look cracked and will only emit a light level of seven, but can be repaired by placing glowstone dust, redstone dust,nautilus shells in the grid squares adjacent to the center of a crafting grid.</p>\n<p>A phantom sees a campfire. It extinguishes it but takes damage.</p>\n<p>A phantom will regenerate if it bites anything that is not a monster. If it absorbs any experience orbs it will become resistant to all types of damage, so do not leave those orbs out in the open.</p>\n<p>Though yes this interferes with the players builds, creepers can do the exact same thing in a different way; why should creepers have all the fun?</p>",
