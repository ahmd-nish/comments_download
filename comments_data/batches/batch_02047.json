They could be upgraded with new weapons amd armor at players cost. They should spawn in a small castle with some loot. The 3 behavior modes suggested are really good ideas. Only that when following they cannot teleport. If the player got on horse or boat and there is another nearby they could use it to follow player. The taming could be by giving them a random amount of emeralds.</p>",

If you kill them, they can respawn nearby and will remember what you did, making it hard to get them to trust you.
