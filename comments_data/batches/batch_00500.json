        "body": "<p>I would strongly agree, but I am not convinced that copper would be best for tools and armor. Copper's uses outside of building seem to be suboptimal, as lightning rods and spyglasses don't seem to have the same amount of utility as tools created with iron or gold such as flint and steel, buckets, compasses, etc.</p>\n<p>I would urge the team to consider using Copper as an \"amplifier\" for enchantments at the enchanting table. When using one smelted Copper ingot with lapis and a tool at the enchanting table, the applied enchantments have their levels increased by anywhere from 1.2 to 2x up to the max limit, so consider maybe Sharpness 2 without copper becomes Sharpness 3 with copper.</p>\n<p>I would also suggest that blocks of copper can be used in redstone the same way that redstone blocks are, just not always automatically powered. In this sense, when a copper block receives a redstone current, it functions as a redstone block, but when it is not powered, no current. This can be incredibly helpful to redstone engineers who want to see a piston-movable and switchable power source.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I would suggest that copper can be used to supplement minecart travel. Adding copper to rails and powered rails can increase minecart speed by 1.5x or 2x. These can make minecarts a more useful form of travel by increasing their top speed, giving late-game players a more competitive option to fireworks and mending elytra's.</p>",
