If a copper golem picks up an item it checks the cache to see if there's a chest with a relevant filter nearby and goes straight to it, really simple and can fit many bases, reach height is solved by having a platform behind the chests which does limit options but if you're going 4/5 high it's against a wall and can be 1 block thicker, not awful.</p>\n<p>I think this is Minecraft-y, I've seen suggestions of slot filters and UI and that's modded. There's also loads of suggestions to use item frames but that just breaks things and will annoy people.</p>\n<p>Also, copper item frames which contain nothing are an any/overflow, this is so that if a copper golem has an item but it doesn't fit a filter it'll place it there regardless of content as long as there's space. Although maybe it could be done better, maybe it's its own thing.</p>\n<p>So many more experienced players do just shirk off the idea that Copper Golems should be better and to just use a hopper sorting system, but that's way too technical, Copper Golems currently work for tiny storage, hopper storage systems for huge, copper item frames should then be for between them.</p>",

It's annoying needing to click around item frames otherwise risking rotating the item. This could be achieved using some kind of lock as to not change item frame functionality, but I don't know if it would really be breaking.</li>\n<li>It could be neat to be able to add text to item frames, so you can show items but you can also add a little bit of text to really explain it. For instance cobblestone on a chest, do you mean it's cobblestone exclusively, or cobblestone variants, or cobblestone blocks, or everything that contains \"cobblestone\"? Ah, the label says \"everything cobblestone\".</li>\n<li>Dyeable item frames of course.</li>\n<li>Iron item frames which act as a hopper/dropper filter - or bundle the functionality into copper item frames.</li>\n<li>Item frames to cover a whole system requires a lot of leather, not necessarily adding an alternate recipe but maybe increasing the quantity to 4?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I definitely think there's enough other stuff for an item frame drop.</p>",

If diamond was much rarer than it would be worth it a new higher ranking set, but as diamond gets more uses and villager trade rebalances aren´t out yet, I highly doubt we see any future high ranking gear. Maybe they will add a new gear with the end update and we could see a rebalance in the gears, maybe diamond taking the place of bronze and netherite the one of diamond and the \"enderite\" taking the place of netherite.</p>",
