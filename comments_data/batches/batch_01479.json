        "body": "<p>Seems a little too overpowered for simply netherrack and a new soul vegetable. Souls are sinister, so they would attack piglins, but they would attack you, too. Soul-based mobs include The Wither, wither skeletons, the warden, vexes, and allays. Out of all of those, only the allay is friendly, and it seems to be made of souls and amethyst, while the warden is made of souls, more souls in the form of sculk, and bones, which is sinister, vexes are made of souls and (very likely) light blue wool, and were given weapons, perhaps made to be like allays, but as bodyguards for the evokers, withers and wither skeletons are made of souls, a horrible disease, and bones. Netherrack is, in my opinion, a sinister block. If it worked like you pointed out, but had less health and attacked all non-soul based mobs (except maybe allays), it could actually add an interesting mechanic, where spawning thins mob would be extremely dangerous, but it could be useful as a last resort when surrounded by mobs, such as when brutes have cornered you. To make it more balanced, they could target piglin brutes first and foremost, piglins secondly, and players third. They will always attack you, even if attacking something else (other than a piglin) if they know where you are. They will stop attacking their enemy immediately and go after you. Final point: I think it would make the most sense if it was made of blackstone, and was called a \"blackstone golem\". Thank you, and great idea!</p>",

This also keeps it in the same theme as the iron golem by using ore blocks. I think they would be too OP if piglins always ran away from them so my idea is that they don't interact with piglins unless the Piglin is attacking the player or the golem itself, then it would kill the piglin. For the Jack o lantern, it would be made the exact same way as a normal jack o lantern but with a soul torch instead of a regular torch. Another idea could maybe be using bone blocks that you get from the soul sand valleys</p>",

That way it's most useful trait is still milk and leather etc... kitty cats should fight for you too since they can be ferocious irl. But also have ocelot tameable and follow you like a beefed up kitty cat almost as tough as a wolf. But I think too much assistance from animals gives people an unrealistic druidic vibe. I think he should have druid power basically.. dominion over animals but that's just my style, I'm growing to kind of like how regulated minecraft is to avoid too much unrealistic phooey.. That being said too realistic borders on zero fun either like travailing over finding a pet that'll even listen in the first place.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",
