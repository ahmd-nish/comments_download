While it doesn't need to take the form of a honeyguide, I really do love the idea of animals interacting with players or other animals for needs of their own. Animals hunting other animals already exists in Minecraft. Beneficial symbiotic relationships would be probably a lot harder to put into the game. But I think some simple, easy to visualize relationships could be really cool (in the future of Minecraft maybe? I'm not making these my suggestions, just offering examples) like monkeys bartering with players for fruit, crows flocking behind wolves in search of dropped mutton, or elusive clownfish hiding in stinging anenomes. The honeyguide, in my opinion, is a really endearing relationship that would be so fun to feature in a game like Minecraft as a mob that doesn't need to be hunted down to be useful.</p>",

As for a shield, it'd be the pressure that kills the things, not the explosion itself so shields wouldn't stop that... BUT it could have shields around it anyway to stop it seeing any Glass while still finding you!<br>(It's theorised that a Flaw seeing it's own reflection stops it from moving...).</p>\n<p>With the Crossbow Nemesis, I think it should only shoot while you're looking away, while strafing left or right to try to avoid you looking at it!</p>\n<p>The Potion Nemesis's resistance spell would probably fit more as an Aura that stabilises nearby Flaws other than it's own type, you'd have to kill these before the others... (Stabilising the Flaws would make them less likely to be killed by an explosion)</p>\n<p>Because of the 1.5k character limit, there was some details I couldn't include in the post.<br>The Flaw are like a Rival to the Endermen, they try to stay clear of any Flaw.</p>\n<p>They actually would AVOID End Cities because of the Purple Stained Glass in the buildings!</p>",
