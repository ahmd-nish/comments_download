And honestly has a perfect post end vibe to alleviate getting around, however I doubt Mojang will go for it since it reduces \"exploring\" encounters. Which if there was some more randomness/events could a point. It also makes Elytra and other transport pointless though so I doubt it'll happen.</p>\n<p>Now if there were random Overworld Portals that lead to dungeons events I could see that. Something like every other full moon the Portals gives access to randomly made dungeon pulling loot, blocks, mobs, and dangers from every dimension, known and yet developed. The Dungeon Event would only be open for 12 in game days, with a gong that sounds off each midnight or upon entry that tells you how many days are left. In a Hardcore or Hard mode, not leaving when the time runs out you end up in the void, for Easy and Peaceful you are teleport back to the entry portal. Items left in the dungeon would vanish or become loot for the next event. This would give replayability, allow for massive structures, and unique rewards, without having to cram it into world gen. Events could be variable too, puzzles or mazes, quest-like missions for a specific item to get the reward would be logical as well.&nbsp;</p>",
