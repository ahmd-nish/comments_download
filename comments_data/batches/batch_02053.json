They could live in Groves, Snowy Slopes and Stony Peaks with their houses set into the mountain itself. If they did live in the snowy mountain biomes then they would be immune to sinking into powder snow. A thought I also had is that you could trade with the Workers and the Roamers. You wouldn’t necessarily have to trade with emeralds but you could trade with armour or weapons or food and they would offer trades that are completely different to Villagers and would be unique to them. Perhaps a new enchantment for your boots that stop you from sinking into powder snow so that you don’t have to keep bringing leather boots with you to explore mountains all the time. These are just thoughts I had. I hope they make sense. It would be cool to have something like this in the game </p>",
