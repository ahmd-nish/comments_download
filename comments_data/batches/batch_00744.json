You can absolutely get at least a few pistons, if not a multitude, early game. I like the concept behind Amethyst being something you have to always go back to and do yourself, much like spawners. But the true problem is how incredibly slow they can get. It's not fun having to go through the effort of finding and excavating one and going back to it each time IF you still have to wait literal hours just for a couple of stacks of a material that isn't that useful anyways, especially when the few uses it has demand it in large amounts. I think it really should get buffed; spending more time doing things can be fun and/or balancing, but just waiting extensively for things to happen without doing anything objectively isn't. It should take time, just not that much; it's not like it's the most powerful or game-breaking item anyway, so really I don't see any issue with being able to get more faster. But I do think the gameplay design should stay as is; people are finally required to be manually/actively engaged with something to obtain it. A bit of a break from the \"I control every single item and have it delivered to my base\" madness. If they are moveable with pistons, people will instantly start moving them closer to their bases, lining them up and connecting them to automatic item farms and sorters; it defeats the point.</p>",
