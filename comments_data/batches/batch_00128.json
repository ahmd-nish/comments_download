There should be bridges connecting the village like a path. I think it would be interesting to have bamboo villages but that should be separate from the jungle village itself and should just be next to a patch of bamboo. It'll be more based on a small town instead of the tribes of the jungle. Cherry wood should have a theme of Eastern Asian culture, not as a stereotype but rather a celebration of history and culture. The villages would have to spawn in cherry groves on normal grass instead of the snow they can spawn on, because it would complicate the spawning of snowy villagers and Cherry villagers. There needs to be a cozy and warm birch village as well and a humid swamp village, a dark oak village situated on top of the dark oak leaves since theres no space on the ground, and finally MANGROVE VILLAGES. It would look amazing. It would be based on asian culture as well, but less modern and more traditional styles instead. You have a great idea, keep being creative!</p>",
