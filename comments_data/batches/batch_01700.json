It's a downgrade, not an upgrade because the normal world border is 30 million blocks out while the farlands are 12.5 million blocks out that's like saying \"Remove the new villages because I like the old nostalgic villages\". The normal world border is cleaner and fewer glitches than the farlands and a lot less laggy too so I think that would be a horrible idea to bring the farlands back and we still have the barrier called the world border so why would we want to replace it with an unstable glitch such as the farlands where if you went far enough you'd fall OUT of the world.&nbsp;</p>",
