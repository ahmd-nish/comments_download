        "body": "<p>I was going to post this myself, so here are the specifics I came up with: When Wandering Traders spawn at the <strong>Point of Interest</strong> for a <strong>desert village</strong>, they may spawn using one camel on a lead in the place of one of the two trader llamas with the exception of leaving the camel behind, maybe even unleashing it easily in exchange for an emerald, <strong>if there are &lt; 2 camels detected in the village's volume</strong>. This allows for camel spawns that 1. maintain the implication that the villagers take care of them, 2. make camels still not too easy to get, but making them accessible outside of new structures, and 3. give a demonstration to new players of the unhittable-by-2-block-tall-mobs feature of camels, if the trader gets on it at night/when husks are nearby.<br>However, this change can come with the flip side that wandering traders will preform a <strong>check</strong> before they despawn from that village <strong>for &gt; 4 </strong>(or 6? not sure) <strong>camels</strong> in that village. If there are more than the critical number of camels, <strong>they may try to \"rent\" one</strong> (give emerald, despawn camel) when they leave. Admittedly, this second part will be harder to implement. The trader could leash a desired camel (unnamed, unequipped) a few minutes before leaving, but it won't really be clear why at first. <strong>The transaction would have to be finalized only when they despawn so that people won't steal the emeralds and keep the camel</strong>, which means the trader'd have to drop an emerald on the ground, where they could be missable.</p>",
