        "body": "<p>\"<strong>Mesa Update</strong><br>I was inspired by this idea from one fashion. Mesa is an empty and uninteresting biome, so you need to update it. Add bandits, with cowboy texture and with a pickaxe in hand. Sometimes they go horseback riding and walking in groups. Bandit camps can be found. How they will look is up to you. Add vultures. There will be no aggressive mob. But it will fly over the player, and when the player dies, the vulture will eat all the loot that has fallen. When it rains in other biomes, there will be a sandstorm in the mesa and the desert. At which sand cover will appear. Snakes - will spawn in small burrows. If the player comes closer than one block, the snake will attack and cause poisoning. Termites - will feed on wood. Both out of hand and in blocks. They will live in a termite mound block of five individuals. If you break the termite mound block, the termites will attack the player by imposing a hunger efect. &nbsp;If you break a termite mound with a pickaxe on a silk touch, the termites will remain inside (the mechanics are similar to a hive) termites will pick up drop-down objects as rushes and take them to the termite mound block. If you break it, the objects will fall out. Toothy beetle - will appear from the ground like a caretaker. If the player stands on it, the beetle will grab it without being able to get out and will slowly devour it. After lunch, the beetle will disappear underground.\"</p>\n<p>- Translated by Admin</p>",

        "body": "<p>Hello!</p>\n<p>In all honesty I'm still not sure about your overall idea (I'm definitely not saying it's a bad one at all, I just haven't thought about it overall). But the season flooding mechanic you just said is quite interesting. Something similar is already in the game with old swamps on top of that. So, even if I'm not sure about your coastal season flooding, I think it would be cool to have, like swamps, special moon phases mechanics. Here are some ideas :</p>\n<p>I think there should be two types of moon phases : Mangroves are very rich in biodiversity so first of all, I think there should be a moon phase where we would see an increase in the amount of fireflies (announced), frogs and slimes. This phase could be a moment where frogs try and make more babies too. Finally, to add more \"magic\" to it, I think the trees could light up with glow berries inside them. It would be so cool visually and would represent the diversity of ressources mangroves have. These glow berries would only appear during this full moon phase.<br>Secondly, to add some challenge and to represent the wildness of mangroves and the difficulty to navigate through them, I think there should be another moon phase where mob spawning increases highly and it becomes way more dangerous.</p>\n<p>To add some spice, we should make that the moon phases for these two events should both be full moon but only one would happen randomly at a time. It will add randomness and a sense of luck too.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>I hope you find my idea interesting!</p>",
