Its quite anoying because its so abused by almost every server, and its frankly vary difficoult to not abuse at all in mapmaing for these reasons, its always up in the screen unlike the chat thing, it has no separade size scaling or opasity setting for players to shose how intrusive they want to let it be... every inworld onscreen element needs to be possible to reduse in some capasity or toggle off, because its what you are looking on during your entire gameplay experiense, which may last for several hours... plz, options...</p>",

I think having more advanced signs that do NOT have this limitation would be great, thus, the formating commands do NOT take up room on the signs! I also think it would be a good idea if we could control the formating like when to start bolding for example and when to stop it! </p>",
