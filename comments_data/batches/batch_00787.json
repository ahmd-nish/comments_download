If it were up to me I would have instead given Drowned Zombies the ability to drop either gold or copper ingots, but be entirely chance based, meaning sometimes they will drop nothing which is a sensible balancing decision. On topic of your opinion I'd be okay with Strays dropping copper instead, but this isn't going to happen and it isn't up to us because it isn't our intellectual property unfortunately, although us paying for a copy of it does mean our desires for content should be respected.</p>",
