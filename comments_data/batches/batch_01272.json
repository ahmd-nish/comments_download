Slower weapons can then trigger more often. I would be happy with either approach.</p>",

It would add replayability and give a chance to get some of that loot in Minecraft dungeons that honestly are more like treasure items. Now to curb this event they only occur rarely (like once every 13 nights sort of thing) a new dungeon is open for 12 days, upon entering the dungeon the player hears a gong, and text message telling them how many days remain and once at midnight if in the dungeon. Upon the end of the timeframe players in Hardcore or Hard would be dropped into the void, Normal and Easy would teleport back to the gateway. Any items left in the dungeon are either lost or loot for the next generation. Special Mobs and Blocks would probably have to be locked in the dimension to prevent bring them back but you'd still get to see new things and face deadly/new threats.</p>",
