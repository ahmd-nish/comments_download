And tables shouldn't *click* anytime you get too close (so annoying). I'd absolutely love to be able to texture the various wood chairs and tables into some really nice choices of furniture without taking away from the choices of stairs and other blocks that only vaguely approximate what I'm looking for. These simple things would go a long way in keeping players a little more centered on vanilla Minecraft without having to add mods to achieve what they want, and settling for any additional effects those mods might also add, but not necessarily be wanted.</p>\n<p>Extra effects could also be afforded along with the new furniture. An added action of sitting in a chair in close proximity to a table could give a minor boost to any food eaten. Sitting with other players in one of a group of chairs with open space in the middle could auto-open chat for a conversation pit or planning meeting.</p>",

And the train generation algorithm indicates you are due to find 4 or more separate abandoned mine shafts anywhere within 20 chunks of this chunk that is being loaded for the first time, it begins to rez-in a \"mining town\".</p>\n\n<p>Mining towns are just a mesa/badlands village (Distinct from the dessert type, less of an Arabic/Pueblo feeling to the buildings, more \"wild west boom town\" with fence gates instead of normal doors on many buildings, for example) they are made primarily out of oak and, oddly, spruce wood, and oak trap-doors in place of glass for the windows. (Just as the updated dessert villages often don't use glass at all.) They have a weighty tendency to have forges/blacksmiths and smelter buildings instead of the usual suspects in terms of jobs for the villagers, and their \"garden\" plots follow advanced \"player technology\" patterns, using a single waterlogged spruce plank at the center of a 7-by-7 square of blank ground, surrounded by an oak fence. </p>\n\n<p>There is a roughly 90% chance that such villages are zombie villages</p>",

I am not saying to redo the structure, yes it would be nice for it to get some TLC it deserves it since almost every Minecrafter has taken the time to get there.
